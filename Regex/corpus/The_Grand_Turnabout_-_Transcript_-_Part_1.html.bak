<line>Lotta:
So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... that's true, I suppose. <textEffects>(I'm no longer a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</textEffects>. However...)</span>
</line><line>Kay:
You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed...
</line>
<hr />
<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This case isn't over yet... The person in the <span style="color:#E16935">red hood</textEffects> who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And <textEffects>this letter from an unknown sender</textEffects>. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...)</span>
</line><line>Lotta:
Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off!
</line><line>Kay:
That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop?
</line><line>Lotta:
What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves...
</line><line>???:
S-Someone! Help!
</line><line>Kay:
Yikes! What's that!?
</line><line>???:
S-Someone! P-Please help!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm. This woman is...)</textEffects> What's happened!?
</line><line>???:
S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A... monster?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me!
</line><line>???:
Please follow me! It's this way!
</line><line>Kay:
Has something else happened? Again!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now.

<line>Kay:
Eh!? These are...!?
</line><line>Lotta:
G-Genuine hoofprints!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Look!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang...! Why is he here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Someone's on the ground!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang!
</line><line>Lang:
......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What happened?
</line><line>Lang:
What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
It's a m... m... monster!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A... monster?
</line><line>Lotta:
Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the <textEffects>Mighty Moozilla</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mighty... Moozilla...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! "Man Trampled to Death by Monster!" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Huang:
I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The real assassin was you all along...!
</line><line>de Killer:
That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That man... could he have...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body?
</line><line>???:
Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(! Agent Lang?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: "First come, first suspected." You! Did you really just discover the body!?
</line><line>???:
O-O-O-O-O-Of course!
</line><line>Kay:
Please calm down! You're scaring her!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He does seem to have lost his composure...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. This isn't like you.
</line><line>Lang:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men?
</line><line>Lang:
What... did you say...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong?
</line><line>Lang:
........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Let us investigate. <textEffects>(Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the "man" behind it, more like the "monster" behind it, ya know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation?
</line><line>Lotta:
Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop!
</line><line>???:
Umm... Excuse me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before...
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? Do you know her?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, I do. <textEffects>(At least I think I do...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</line><line>Penny:
My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...)</textEffects> It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is...
</line><line>Penny:
Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police?
</line><line>Penny:
Y-Yes! Right away!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things <span style="color:#E16935">besides the body that concern me</textEffects>. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...)</span>

Tee-hee. It's the equipment we use for filming. The Moozilla costume and the camera crane.
</line><line>Kay:

...Mr. Prosecutor. Right now, I'm just a single Interpol agent. A literal lone wolf. They probably won't let me be in charge of the investigation. But you better believe... my fangs are as sharp as ever...! I'd definitely capture the culprit with my own hands. And you'd better not get in my way.

<line>Edgeworth:
Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?
</line><line>Kay:
You're right! It looks just like it! Maybe it's a prop for the film?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Based on the size of the horn... the head should be quite large.
</line><line>Kay:
I wonder how it ended up here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure we'll find out if we ask someone on the staff.

<textEffects>(Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?)</textEffects> Hm?

........ ........
</line><line>Lang:
........
</line><line>???:
.....Move it.
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners.

...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already.
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Penny:
I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John!
</line><line>Lang:
Tch!
</line><line>Penny:
Oh! What were you doing!?
</line><line>???:
.......Who was that?
</line><line>Penny:
Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him?
</line><line>???:
Hmph.
</line><line>Kay:
That sure was a tense standoff!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The lead actor... is this child?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>John:
.......Prosecutor?
</line><line>Penny:
He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know.
</line><line>John:
But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gah! <textEffects>(He's frightfully perceptive...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there...

............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished.
</line><line>Kay:
So the murder weapon really is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the <textEffects>monster head</textEffects> is quite high.
</line><line>Kay:
So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm?
</line><line>Lang:
Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived.
</line><line>Bodyguard:
Mr. President!
</line><line>Lang:
They really were... far too late.
</line><line>Bodyguard:
Damn it! Who did this!?
</line><line>Lang:
...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What? What do you mean?
</line><line>Lang:
Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have <textEffects>extraterritorial rights</textEffects> here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of <textEffects>Interpol</textEffects>, they're letting me assist in the investigation...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So they've already established a plan for this investigation?
</line><line>Lang:
I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a <textEffects>security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th... This is!
</line><line>Lang:
This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen!
</line><line>Kay:
Wh-Why is Ms. Courtney there!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So he's saying Judge Courtney is the murder?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a "prosecutor".
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Lang:
Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmph...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!?
</line><line>Lang:
.......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a "prosecutor"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
........ <textEffects>(Why do I still continue to investigate...?)</textEffects> Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent?
</line><line>Lang:
..........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as "<textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>" has nothing to do with it. As long as the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that <textEffects>truth</textEffects>. For that is a part of my creed.
</line><line>Lang:
........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You have my thanks...
</line><line>Lang:
However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way!
</line><line>Lang:
Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Why Courtney? --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.
Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.
At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.
There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(President Huang and Judge Courtney... Did those two have some sort of connection?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president.
</line><line>Kay:
Does that mean... the last person to see the president was...
</line><line>Lang:
Exactly... Courtney, you mean? It's gotta be her!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!)</textEffects>
</line>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low.
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios.
</line><line>Kay:
Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for John.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This photo was taken <textEffects>yesterday</textEffects>.
</line><line>Lang:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If Judge Courtney had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken!
</line><line>Lang:
Owwoooooooh!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not?
</line><line>Kay:
I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent!
</line><line>Lang:
Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning?
</line><line>Lang:
........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: "The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years." My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that...
</line><line>Lang:
Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In here?
</line><line>Lang:
Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, there is no need for a search.
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence proves that Judge Courtney could not have hidden the body!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut <textEffects>last night</textEffects>.
</line><line>Lang:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Therefore, Judge Courtney could not have entered the film lot two nights ago!
</line><line>Lang:
Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago?
</line><line>Lang:
Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Why Courtney? Pt. 2 --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
A photo was recorded <textEffects>10-20 minutes after</textEffects> the president went up to the roof with that woman.
That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.
After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!
There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?
Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The president never came down from the rooftop?
</line><line>Lang:
That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Courtney...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky.
</line><line>Kay:
That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?)</textEffects>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>A photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lang:
<textEffects>Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is.
</line><line>Lang:
A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor.
</line><line>Lang:
The 51st floor?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator.
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility.
</line><line>Lang:
In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into!
</line><line>Kay:
No way! I'm sick of that place!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.)</textEffects> The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the <textEffects>black market auction</textEffects>. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday.
</line><line>Lang:
...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not?
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president.
</line><line>Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL!
</line><line>Kay:
Eek!
</line><line>Lang:
Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wh... What's this?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces!
</line><line>Kay:
Eeeeeek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...She ran away.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...)</textEffects> I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize.
</line><line>Lang:
......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now.
</line><line>Kay:
...I'm sorry.
</line><line>Lang:
...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer.
</line><line>Lotta:
Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh. What's it to you?
</line><line>Lotta:
Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon.
</line><line>Lang:
What?
</line><line>Lotta:
The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me!
</line><line>Lang:
Really?
</line><line>Lotta:
I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is it?
</line><line>Lang:
I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Courtney two days ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day.
</line><line>Lang:
I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of.
</line><line>Kay:
There is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth.
</line><line>Kay:
Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right?
</line><line>Officer:
Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy...
</line><line>Lang:
Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Officer:
I also have one more thing to report...
</line><line>Lang:
What is it?
</line><line>Officer:
We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
What kind of footprints?
</line><line>Officer:
Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Penny:
Huh!?
</line><line>Kay:
A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who... was that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
U-Umm...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ms. Nichols?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is there something you want to say? <textEffects>(What is she so scared of?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's not something you need to be so worried about...)</textEffects> What is it?
</line><line>Penny:
Last night... I... I actually came here.
</line><line>Lang:
What!?
</line><line>Penny:
Eek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why did you come here?
</line><line>Penny:
...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on John.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John... You mean John Marsh? <textEffects>(As I thought...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Penny:
Yes. Last night, umm... John stayed here late in order to practice by myself.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow! He's really dedicated!
</line><line>Penny:
Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She must have witnessed something last night...)</textEffects> When was this?
</line><line>Penny:
Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm...
</line><line>Lang:
You... saw something?
</line><line>Penny:
.....Y-Yes. John was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck.
</line><line>Kay:
A neck?
</line><line>Penny:
Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur!
</line><line>Lotta:
Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal!
</line><line>Kay:
What!? So this time it's Gourdy!?
</line><line>Penny:
Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, John is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla!
</line><line>Lotta:
Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right?
</line><line>Penny:
E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!?
</line><line>Lotta:
You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, Missy... Did you really see that?
</line><line>Penny:
Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that.
</line><line>Lang:
What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony?
</line><line>Lang:
Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John Marsh... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it?
</line><line>Lang:
Atta boy!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
John Marsh...! We've got some questions for you!
</line><line>................
</line><line>Penny:
U-Umm... John kind of left a while ago.
</line><line>Lang:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Kay:
L-Let's go after him!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 6, 10:54 AMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
Tch! Where'd he run off to!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He might have just gone back home.
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!
</line><line>Lang:
...Or he may have run away.
</line><line>Kay:
A-Aren't you just overthinking things?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself.
</line><line>Lang:
Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very funny.
</line><line>Lang:
I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Gummy!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uuugh... I, I... I...!
</line><line>Kay:
He ran away...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What is the detective doing...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that?
</line><line>Kay:
Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before?
</line><line>Lang:
That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Subordinates... and partners...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Well then. I'll be seeing you two.
</line><line>Lotta:
He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop!
</line><line>Kay:
Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie.
</line><line>Kay:
How about we go monster hunting too?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well... <textEffects>(Hm? Isn't that...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't that one of Lang's men...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.)</textEffects> Excuse me...
</line><line>MIB:
Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while.
</line><line>Kay:
Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang?
</line><line>MIB:
Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What exactly happened?
</line><line>MIB:
Do you remember the incident from one month ago?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The "Yatagarasu Incident" we had been involved with.)</textEffects>
</line><line>MIB:
Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a <textEffects>dangerous criminal</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.)</textEffects>
</line><line>MIB:
Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded.
</line><line>Kay:
Disbanded...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf.
</line><line>Kay:
Then... Why are you here?
</line><line>MIB:
That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you...
</line><line>MIB:
.......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after John. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle.
</line><line>Kay:
What angle would that be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...We should listen to what Judge Courtney has to say.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Courtney is...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
She said that she had a trial coming up!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well.
</line><line>Kay:
'Kay!

<line>Courtney:
Court is now in session. Is the defense ready?
</line><line>Ray:
Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want.
</line><line>Franziska:
The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice.
</line><line>Ray:
I guess this is the last job Courtney-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie?
</line><line>Franziska:
What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial.
</line><line>Courtney:
...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Patricia Roland, to the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Roland:
........
</line><line>Courtney:
Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement?
</line><line>Franziska:
Very well, Your Honor. The defendant...

</line><line>Roland:
...Please wait, Your Honor.
</line><line>Courtney:
What is it?
</line><line>Roland:
Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this?
</line><line>Courtney:
Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement.
</line><line>Roland:
Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it.
</line><line>Franziska:
...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Roland is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong?
</line><line>Franziska:
Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...!
</line><line>Ray:
What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie?
</line><line>Franziska:
The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Dogen's bell attached to it is missing too!
</line><line>Ray:
Wh... Whaaat!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this?
</line><line>Franziska:
I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor.
</line><line>Roland:
If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce.
</line><line>Franziska:
I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah!
</line><line>Ray:
...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Courtney-pie.
</line><line>Courtney:
What is it?
</line><line>Ray:
Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later?
</line><line>Courtney:

The defense's proposal is overruled.
</line><line>Ray:
Eh? Courtney-pie...?

I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible.

</line><line>Roland:
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "<textEffects>In court, evidence is everything</textEffects>." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
</line><line>Courtney:
.......... That is correct.
</line><line>Franziska:
Eh!
</line><line>Ray:
What!?
</line><line>Courtney:
The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...

Hold your horses, Courtney-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden!

Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a "not guilty" verdict...
</line><line>Ray:
Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon!
</line><line>Courtney:
........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people.

There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor!
</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line><line>Ray:
Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Courtney-pie. Please...
</line><line>Courtney:
........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request.
</line><line>Roland:
Well! Justine-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today?
</line><line>Courtney:
This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial.
</line><line>Franziska:
...Understood, Your Honor.
</line><line>Ray:
Phew. That was a close one.
</line><line>Courtney:
Court is now adjourned!

<line>Kay:
Didn't we find it together!? The evidence!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, we certainly did.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.
</line><line>Kay:
Really! Why?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!)</textEffects> Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.
</line><line>Courtney:
The chisel...?
</line><line>Debeste:
Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...
</line><line>Roland:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I wonder if it was stolen by someone...
</line><line>???:
Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Berry and Mr. Keyes. Did you come to attend the trial?
</line><line>Regina:
I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it?
</line><line>Simon:
The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?
</line><line>Kay:
Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simon.
</line><line>Simon:
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!?
</line><line>Regina:
Ah ha ha! Looks like Simon's going to get arrested again!
</line><line>Simon:
Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...!
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm. I guess Simon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh?
</line><line>???:
To think that I would be humiliated like this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...And here comes another noisy individual.
</line><line>Ray:
Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say?
</line><line>Franziska:
That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime!
</line><line>Ray:
Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Ray:
If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them.
</line><line>Ray:
Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task.
</line><line>Ray:
Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time.
</line><line>Franziska:
..........
</line><line>Ray:
Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this?
</line><line>Franziska:
.....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news...
</line><line>Ray:
Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation.
</line><line>Franziska:
! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the "former" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'm glad that you're on board.
</line><line>Simon:
I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again.
</line><line>Regina:
This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin?
</line><line>Kay:
I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste.
</line><line>Simon:
Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll leave him to you.
</line><line>Ray:
Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes.... I'll keep that in mind.
</line><line>Ray:
Franny-pie, wait for meeeee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Judge Courtney...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well.
</line><line>Kay:
All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay! There's no need for that.
</line><line>Kay:
But...! Even though Ms. Courtney should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...?
</line><line>Courtney:
........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, is this the "<textEffects>Judge persona</textEffects>" of Justine Courtney we're seeing?
</line><line>Courtney:
Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?)</textEffects> Judge Courtney. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you.
</line><line>Courtney:
And what would that be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower.
</line><line>Courtney:
! The roof... you say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera.
</line><line>Courtney:
Is there some sort of problem with that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower.
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof?
</line><line>Courtney:
Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about?
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-That... I cannot say.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Two nights ago, Judge Courtney met with President Huang...
</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line>
<center><b>4 CHESS PIECES</b></center>
<line>Courtney:
...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her <textEffects>what she talked about with the president</textEffects>!
</line>
<center><textEffects>Begin Logic Chess</textEffects></center>

<line>Edgeworth:
Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about?
</line><line>Courtney:
My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
I appreciate your understanding.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations.
</line><line>Courtney:
I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge?
</line><line>Courtney:
.....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This morning, you returned Kay's "promise notebook" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties.
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Courtney:
.....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the "Mighty Moozilla". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is...
</line><line>Courtney:
I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla.
</line><line>Courtney:
Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal <textEffects>her secret</textEffects> through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed.
</line><line>Courtney:
I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts?
</line><line>Courtney:
Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You're worried about Sebastian "as well"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about?
</line><line>Courtney:
Ah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior?
</line><line>Courtney:
...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement!
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Courtney:
Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Why don't you tell me the truth?
</line><line>Courtney:
I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For Judge Courtney to become this distraught... I should find out exactly <textEffects>who she is searching for</textEffects>. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Let me try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Could it be you're searching for that child who has gone missing?
</line><line>Courtney:
Aaaah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Since you said it was a "child", I presume they're of a young age, correct?
</line><line>Courtney:
I simply cannot answer any questions about him...That boy has nothing to do with you, or the president's assassination...
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
Since he went into hiding of his own accord, he could return whenever he wanted to...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could it be, the person you're searching for is unable to return under their own power?
</line><line>Courtney:
In regards to that, my lips are sealed... I am unable to talk about it right now... When I think about what might happen to that child if I talked...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
"That child"... Could you tell me who you are referring to?
</line><line>Courtney:
! I-It's nothing! ...Please pay it no mind.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney's expression has changed. It seems I've managed to uncover a <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.

</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>




<line>Edgeworth:
From the way you're talking... It seems you have a problem with where he died?
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-That's not true. It's just... For the president to have passed away at a film lot, a place where dreams are made... I just thought it would be better if the movie's cast and crew... remained unaware of the truth.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I'm very sorry to say this... However, the movie's cast and crew are already aware of the president's death. I encountered a female staff member and John Marsh at the crime scene...
</line><line>Courtney:
N-No! Ahh... How would it have come to this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm. She seems to react strongly when it comes to the staff of the Moozilla film. This could be a useful <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.

<line>Edgeworth:
Let me try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that "child" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Courtney:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!?
</line><line>Courtney:
...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of John Marsh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts?
</line><line>Courtney:
Well... That much, I simply cannot say...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!?
</line><line>Courtney:
.....!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. <textEffects>Why is she searching for John</textEffects>... I must get her to tell me the reason.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
...My apologies. I seem to have lost my composure.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You tend to lose your calm whenever the conversation turns to John, don't you?
</line><line>Courtney:
Uh...! I-In any case... While I may know everything about John, it is a one-sided relationship.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Let me try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I understand you're worried about him, but aren't you a bit too flustered? You told me earlier that you had spoken with John. Doesn't that prove that you are indeed acquainted with him!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Ah... Aaaaah! How could I have committed such an indiscretion...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears that John and Judge Courtney are acquaintances... This could be a vital <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.

<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
I knew his movie was being filmed in front of the Grand Tower... ...so the temporary film lot had been on my mind.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I see. I suppose a fan would be curious about that. Did you know that John was at the temporary film lot?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes... Of course I did. He said they would be filming there all day today, and yet...!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
It almost sounds as if John himself told you personally.
</line><line>Courtney:
Ah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I doubt he would give his schedule to a mere fan!
</line><line>Courtney:
That's... true, isn't it? Please don't pay any mind to that statement...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She made another slip of the tongue... She must be really worried about John. So, she has spoken with John... This could be a useful <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.

<line>Edgeworth:
Let me try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...

I don't know what kind of relationship you have with John... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances!
</line><line>Courtney:
E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him?
</line><line>Courtney:
Help...? No, that won't be allowed?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law?
</line><line>Courtney:
...The person who knows where that child is..
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about John... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right?
</line><line>Courtney:
A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped John.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is John's kidnapping related to you in any way?
</line><line>Courtney:
......John and I are... ...mother and child...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of John's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate.

Yes... John is indeed my son. Please look at this...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This is a clipping from a magazine...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
It's an article about John! Do you always carry this around with you?

<textEffects>(It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
.......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What were their demands?
</line><line>Courtney:
They had only one demand. A "<textEffects>Not Guilty</textEffects>" verdict for Patricia Roland...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I see. So that's what happened...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Roland:
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
</line><line>Courtney:
.......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
So, that's why you were going to deliver a "<textEffects>Not Guilty</textEffects>" verdict earlier?
</line><line>Courtney:
I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Judge Courtney.
</line><line>Courtney:
The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son!

Of course you can't!

A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?

Indeed. <textEffects>(To declare a goddess guilty...)</textEffects> We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child.

.....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Judge Courtney! So this is where you've been.

</line><line>Kay:
.......... Ms. Courtney! ...My father, he was a prosecutor.
</line><line>Courtney:
Your father...?
</line><line>Kay:
Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now?
</line><line>Courtney:
If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict...

Prosecutor Edgeworth...

And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save John.
</line><line>Kay:
You got it! Just leave everything to us!
</line><line>Courtney:
Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son.
</line><line>Courtney:
And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief?
</line><line>Kay:
As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down John...

<line>Lang:
Tch! Where'd he run off to!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He might have just gone back home.

That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!
</line><line>Lang:
...Or he may have run away.

H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now!

Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant!

"Even in the depths of night..."
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Kay:
Aww, come on! Say the rest with me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And just why should I do that!?
</line><line>Kay:
Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have no intention of becoming a thief.
</line><line>Kay:
Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation.
</line><line>Kay:
Tch. You're no fun.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...We don't have time for "fun". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately.

What if the kidnappers stole the box?
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! You mean they...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. They took it in order to carry John inside it.
</line><line>Kay:
John's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see John was because...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage.
</line><line>Kay:
But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat.
</line><line>Kay:
I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them?
</line><line>Driver:
Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk.
</line><line>Kay:
Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers!

Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know <textEffects>about the kidnappers</textEffects>. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw!

A kidnapper can easily use his own home to hold someone captive. Sebastian... you were kidnapped by your own father!

Wh... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I-It can't be... Was he going to kill me because... I was a nuisance?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Would there be any reason for him to take your life? If his son was found dead in his own garage, Blaise would be suspected immediately.
</line><line>Debeste:
.....I see! Th-Then... Why was I kidnapped?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Kidnapping his own son... I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be after any ransom money... There must be some other reason why Blaise ordered the kidnapping. This could be a useful <span style="color:#E16935">clue</textEffects>.)</span>

Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense.

.....Y-Yeah, you're right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped?

Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away...

<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>

Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, "Do you know Courtney?"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was John Marsh. They were planning to kidnap Judge Courtney's son... ...in order to have Patricia Roland declared not guilty!
</line><line>Debeste:
J-Justine has a son...? And Warden Roland gets declared not guilty...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for John Marsh.
</line><line>Debeste:
A-All of this... was just a mistake?&#160;! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm...? Did you just remember something?
</line><line>Debeste:
N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me <textEffects>what he remembered</textEffects>, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet!

I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy...

Would "that guy" happen to be Blaise?
</line><line>Debeste:
D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor?
</line><line>Debeste:
What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Debeste:
S-Say something!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You must have some reason for choosing this path, right?
</line><line>Debeste:
...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Debeste:
It was just... a personal reason.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason.
</line><line>Debeste:
Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I see... so, you wanted your father's approval.
</line><line>Debeste:
Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would you... happen to be protecting your father?
</line><line>Debeste:
Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could?

Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition!

Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are?
</line><line>Debeste:
But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime!

Apparently, Pops is the one who recommended Roland to be the warden.

</line><line>Debeste:
Probably because... unlike me, Pops actually cares about her!

<textEffects>(By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!)</textEffects> Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this?
</line><line>Courtney:
...I will allow it.

<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields.
</line><line>Ray:
Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We found Sebastian.
</line><line>Ray:
Oh! And the knife and chisel?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon.
</line><line>Ray:
Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Patricia Roland and Blaise.
</line><line>Ray:
Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
I'll grill him personally.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I will continue to search for the missing evidence. <textEffects>(And for John, as well...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood. <textEffects>(How much longer can Judge Courtney's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Kay:
So? How's the trial going?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though.
</line><line>Kay:
He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him.
</line><line>Kay:
OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else?
</line><line>Kay:
The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand.
</line><line><textEffects>IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then... is there anything else?
</line><line>Kay:
Of course! Last but not least... We've got this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious.
</line><line>Kay:
But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! <textEffects>(Sebastian?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! What're you doing here?
</line><line>Debeste:
WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!
</line><line>Kay:
H-He ignored us...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:

Yes... Let us go.

<line>Kay:
There's something inside the safe!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here...
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a <textEffects>photo</textEffects> here too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? This is a picture of...!
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Knightley:
...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out.
</line><line><textEffects>I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Dogen. Dogen's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Dogen's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This... seems to be a report about Knightley.
</line><line>Kay:
Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...)</textEffects> Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Patricia Roland.
</line><line>Kay:
I knew it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The question, however, is who this report was addressed to.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! The owner of this safe is...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Conductor... Blaise Debeste.
</line><line>Kay:
So, this proves that Ms. Roland and Blaise are connected!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland were searching for <textEffects>Dogen's henchmen</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Sirhan Dogen! That dog-loving assassin!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them.
</line><line>Kay:
I wonder what it could be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know, but it must be related to this case.

</line><line>Kay:
Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing!

<line>Edgeworth:
Hm? There's something on his finger.
</line><line>Kay:
Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't steal it.
</line><line>Kay:
Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It's Horace Knightley's... <textEffects>The chessboard and the ring</textEffects>... All of his possessions are inside this safe.
</line><line>Kay:
So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Correct.
</line><line>Kay:
Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... That's too bad. <textEffects>(Horace Knightley... is dead.)</textEffects>

There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer!
</line><line>de Killer:
It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Kay:
Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!?
</line><line>de Killer:
As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some "<textEffects>Heavenly Cotton Candy</textEffects>"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
The meaning of my message... Have you understood it?
</line>
<hr />
<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Have you been spying on us this whole time?
</line><line>de Killer:
Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?)</textEffects> Were you the one... who murdered the president?
</line><line>de Killer:
No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.)</textEffects> ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...!
</line><line>de Killer:
I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>("Thanks" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is he saying that his client murdered the president?)</textEffects> Just who is this person you are referring to...?
</line><line>de Killer:
I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself.
</line><line>Kay:
What are you going to do when you find your client?
</line><line>de Killer:
Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor.
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them?
</line><line>de Killer:
...I will leave that up to your imagination.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It certainly won't be anything pleasant...)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Sirhan Dogen escaped from prison.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>de Killer:
Three nights past, Dogen's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He visited Dogen's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So, De Killer and Dogen. These two assassins...)</textEffects>

<textEffects>Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It sounds like they're using a voice changer...)</textEffects> Who is this?

<textEffects>Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The red hood?)</textEffects> ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself!</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. <textEffects>(I'll put it on speaker...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!? <textEffects>(This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You have no reason to thank me!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Courtney's son.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How could this person know something like that...? Judge Courtney was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little John is in my care right now.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
You even know it's my first job!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why does this person know everything in so much detail?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after John as well, y'see.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So there were two kidnappings...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is John there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped John or not.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is your objective? Is it to get Patricia Roland declared not guilty?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So his objective is different from Blaise's?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(They don't know anything about the kidnapping.)</textEffects> Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago.
</line><line>Simon:
Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again.

<line>Edgeworth:
Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that John is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum.
</line><line>Kay:
One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
.....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You have my thanks, Detective.

<line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help!
</line><line>Kay:
I'll help too! Stealing John back is my job, after all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time.
</line><line>Kay:
Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yessir!

Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight...

Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth.

<textEffects>(Blaise Debeste...!)</textEffects>

Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet!
</line><line>Blaise:
Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor?

<hr />
<line>Blaise:
Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her.

However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you!

What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Roland?
</line><line>Blaise:
Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, "Former" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court?
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while.
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What are you saying...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify!

There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Courtney?

........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh! As long as John is still in danger... ...Judge Courtney cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!)</textEffects> Judge Courtney. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant.

</line><line>Ray:
Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Courtney-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.)</textEffects> Judge Courtney! We've already determined the general location of that <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>. It's only a matter of time before she steals the <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> back.
</line><line>Courtney:
! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Thank you, Your Honor.
</line><line>Blaise:
This is ridiculous!
</line><line>Courtney:
This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! <textEffects>(Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man.
</line><line>Ray:
A certain man?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Patricia Roland.
</line><line>Ray:
! So that means, that was the interrogation where...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right... Patricia Roland murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report!
</line><line>Courtney:
That... definitely sounds like vital evidence!
</line><line>Franziska:

</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a "written report". Now, just who in the world was that report written for?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.
</line><line>Franziska:
The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste!
</line><line>Blaise:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You received a report about the victim from Warden Roland! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case?
</line><line>Blaise:
......In regards to that, I refuse to answer.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?
</line><line>Blaise:
It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not?
</line><line>Blaise:
I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your logic is twisted...!
</line><line>Blaise:
That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Courtney? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the <textEffects>law</textEffects> as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh... As I thought, until John has been rescued...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'see? The <textEffects>truth</textEffects> at the scene and the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> in the courtroom are two very different things.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you're saying the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake?
</line><line>Blaise:
What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>. That's all it is, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Blaise:
Now then, Courtney. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know.

</line><line>Blaise:
Why did you come back here, now of all times?

Sebastian! What is the meaning of this?
</line><line>Franziska:
Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial?
</line><line>Debeste:
I-I'm sorry. I was... umm...
</line><line>Franziska:
Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed!
</line><line>Debeste:
I... umm... well...
</line><line>Blaise:
Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself!
</line><line>Debeste:
.....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench!

Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings?
</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line><line>Ray:
Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same.
</line><line>Franziska:
.....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor.
</line><line>Courtney:
..........
</line><line>Blaise:
Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Courtney.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped John. As long as John still hasn't been found... ...Judge Courtney will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
.......... Th-That sound is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Her cell phone...!)</textEffects> Hm...! <textEffects>(My phone as well...?)</textEffects>

We've found John, sir!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Excellent work, Detective!
</line><line>Ray:
That kid was the <textEffects>most important piece of evidence</textEffects>, right? Way to go, Kay!
</line><line>Kay:
Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call!

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
.....Judge Courtney. It's for you.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
.......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content.
</line><line>Blaise:
Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know!
</line><line>Courtney:
Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench!
</line><line>Debeste:
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
</line><line>Franziska:
........Sebastian Debeste.
</line><line>Debeste:
Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
.....I leave the rest to you.
</line><line>Debeste:
Huh...?
</line><line>Franziska:
"Going up against your own father..." It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...?
</line><line>Debeste:
.....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor.
</line><line>Ray:
You mean they've finally been found!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!?
</line><line>Debeste:
...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Too late...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Debeste:
I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
Pops, where are you going?
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint <textEffects>sound of a bell</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ray:
Could that sound have been, by any chance...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...the bell attached to Dogen's chisel!?
</line><line>Courtney:
In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence?
</line><line>Blaise:
........
</line><line>Debeste:
I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry...
</line><line>Ray:
Where exactly did you search for it?
</line><line>Debeste:
The <textEffects>garbage dump</textEffects>! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Hm? Isn't that...! <textEffects>(Sebastian?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! What're you doing here?
</line><line>Debeste:
WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!
</line><line>Kay:
H-He ignored us...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
But... but... ...this was all I could find.
</line><line>Courtney:
This is...? It smells rather peculiar...
</line><line>Ray:
Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well...
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what of the knife?
</line><line>Debeste:
I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself.
</line><line>Courtney:
...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence.
</line><line>Blaise:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it?
</line><line>Debeste:
Urk...!
</line><line>Blaise:
Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already!
</line><line>Ray:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ray:
It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet.
</line><line>Blaise:
...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know.
</line><line>Ray:
I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> can be exposed in court and take him down!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!)</textEffects> Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence.
</line><line>Debeste:
R... Right!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Let's have a look inside. <textEffects>(It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.)</textEffects> This is... the bell that was attached to Dogen's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it?
</line><line>Debeste:
.....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it...
</line><line>Courtney:
What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!?
</line><line>Blaise:
Did you even find anything?
</line><line>Debeste:
D... Darn it...
</line><line>Blaise:
Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?)</textEffects> Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... <textEffects>(However...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!?
</line><line>Blaise:
Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument?

</line><line>Debeste:
Justine, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined!
</line><line>Blaise:
You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Debeste:
We're still not done examining the <textEffects>newspaper</textEffects> that the bell was wrapped in!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's "worthless" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Is this... a handprint?
</line><line>Debeste:
! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics?
</line><line>Courtney:
Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Forensics:
Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove!
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Blaise:
Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up.
</line><line>Ray:
...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that.
</line><line>Blaise:
What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be <textEffects>The Best</textEffects>, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son!
</line><line>Debeste:
Pops...! I.....!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Courtney... and me.
</line><line>Debeste:
........Uuunghh.
</line><line>Blaise:
Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight.
</line><line>Debeste:
Stinking...
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering.
</line><line>Debeste:

</line><line>Debeste:
Wrong... You're wrong, Pops.
</line><line>Blaise:
...Sebastian? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Debeste:
...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me!
</line><line>Blaise:
What...?
</line><line>Debeste:
...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil...
</line><line>Debeste:
I know something that smells just like it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, back then...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Prosecutor Debeste...)</textEffects> ..........Summon... your courage. "<textEffects>Become a different prosecutor from your father</textEffects>"... Wasn't that what you decided?
</line><line>Debeste:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>?
</line><line>Debeste:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together...
</line><line>Debeste:
...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. <textEffects>Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles...
</line><line>Debeste:
Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage!
</line><line>Blaise:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather <textEffects>peculiar shape</textEffects>? The five letters that spell out <textEffects>D-E-A-T-H</textEffects>. It's exactly the same as your own gloves.
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is that really the case?
</line><line>Debeste:
That's not the only thing that these <textEffects>two pieces of evidence have in common</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...)</textEffects> <textEffects>This is the unmistakable similarity they both share!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
If you examine the imprint left by the letter <textEffects>A</textEffects>, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove.
</line><line>Blaise:
Whaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these <textEffects>dirt stains</textEffects>. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence.
</line><line>Courtney:
Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately!
</line><line>Blaise:
Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!?
</line><line>Debeste:
Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant...
</line><line>Blaise:
Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake!

</line><line>Blaise:
Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around?
</line><line>Debeste:
I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. "I am... truly powerless." I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now!
</line><line>Blaise:
Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!?

</line><line>Debeste:
Pops, I'll show you the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> you never knew... through this trial.
</line><line>Blaise:
Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son!
</line><line>Debeste:
You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye.
</line><line>Blaise:
You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!
</line><line>Courtney:
It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered.
</line><line>Roland:
...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime.
</line><line>Roland:
Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste.
</line><line>Debeste:
Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed... That's correct. <textEffects>(He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned.

Huh!?

Wh-Who are you?

<hr />
<line>Lang:
Judge Courtney. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: "The end of the trial is not always the end of the case."
</line><line>Courtney:
And who... might you be?
</line><line>Lang:
The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator.
</line><line>Courtney:
Do you have some objection with this trial?
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night.
</line><line>Roland:
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
</line><line>Lang:
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. What are you talking about?
</line><line>Lang:
The <textEffects>SS-5 Incident</textEffects> from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(12 years ago...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Patricia Roland. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan...
</line><line>Roland:
Rrgh...
</line><line>Courtney:
Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago?
</line><line>Lang:
That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Justine Courtney...!
</line><line>Courtney:
M... Me?
</line><line>Lang:
You, and one other...
</line><line>John:
..........
</line><line>Courtney:
John!
</line><line>Lang:
Ms. Courtney! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!

</line><line>Lang:
Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well.
