Maya:
Hey! Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it this time?
</line><line>Maya:
You won't believe how many people are here for the trial!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... It is a murder case.
</line><line>Maya:
What are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Next door"...?
</line><line>Maya:
Why don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Atmey...?
</line><line>Maya:
They say they're going to try him as Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Already? That was fast...
</line><line>Maya:
Boy, I'd love to see Mask☆DeMasque's trial.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>...I know...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
By the way, where's Pearls?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>...I know you don't like me...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.
</line><line>Ron:
Pleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!
</line><line>Maya:
...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!
</line><line>Ron:
No one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...
</line><line>Maya:
Come on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't mean... You're the murderer...!?
</line><line>Ron:
N-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief <textEffects>can't really be "poor".</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of <span style="color:#E16935">set plans</textEffects>. Plans that someone had been sending to him to <textEffects>"help" him commit the heists</textEffects>.)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Do you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid... That's not an option.
</line><line>Maya:
...?
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>October 14, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 6</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Godot:
You're "ready"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.
</line><line>Judge:
...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Ron DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.
</line><line>Judge:
... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?
</line><line>Judge:
...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as <textEffects>1 AM</textEffects> of the previous day.
</line><line>Godot:
And... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.
</line><line>Godot:
I never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.
</line><line>Judge:
Um, Mr. Godot. Your witness...?
</line><line>Godot:
...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.
</line><line>Judge:
The defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of <span style="color:#E16935">trust</textEffects> in me back then...)</span> We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! You've got guts, Trite.
</line><line>Judge:
Alright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Godot:
...You did it. Didn't you?
</line><line>Ron:
Yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Ron:
Uh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!
</line><line>Judge:
...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.
</line><line>Maya:
*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?
</line><line>Ron:
W-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I w<textEffects>ish I could go home</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- My Visit To KB Security --</textEffects></center>
<line>Ron:
That evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.
The blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.
I'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.
</line><line>Godot:
The weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.
</line><line>Maya:
You'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination, if you please.
</line>

<line>Ron:
<textEffects>That evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ron:
<textEffects>The blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Ron:
<textEffects>The blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.</textEffects>
</line>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Ron:
<textEffects>I'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.</textEffects>
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Ron:
<textEffects>He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Maya:
Hmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.
</line><line>Maya:
Uh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday.
</line><line>Ron:
Huh...? What doesn't?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think you must have been scared... Very scared. Of having a <textEffects>certain person</textEffects> find out your secret...
</line><line>Ron:
*gulp*
</line><line>Judge:
A certain person...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Desirée DeLite. The defendant's wife.
</line><line>Ron:
Waah! But I-I...! L-Listen to me! My Dessie! She's...!
</line><line>Godot:
...Looks like if I just sit back and relax, the fun will end before it truly begins.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grr! Godot!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Yes, we know. It was all your wife's fault.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Godot:
Mr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... Hmm...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No! Everything is falling neatly into place for him!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
D-Don't talk about my Dessie like that... Or you'll be sooooooorry!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, it seems... ...that we've learned a great deal of things here, so far.
</line><line>Maya:
What do you think, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...
</line><line>Judge:
Clearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.
</line><line>Godot:
The motive is clear. Let's move on.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugggh...
</line><line>Godot:
What happened at the crime scene at 1 in the morning, Mr. DeLite? Come now! Tell us! We're all ears.

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- At the CEO's Office --</textEffects></center>
<line>Ron:
When I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...
Suddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.
If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!
When I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I see... Suddenly hit on the forehead, huh? I believe the detective from yesterday provided similar testimony. He said that Mask☆DeMasque struck him on the head from behind.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Of course, since Atmey turned out to be the culprit himself, that was all a lie.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! No one's going to believe a pathetic lie like that.
</line><line>Ron:
Wh-What are you saying!? I really was attacked!
</line><line>Judge:
We'll find out if what you say is true or not during the cross-examination.
</line><line>Godot:
Got that, Mr. Trite? Don't go easy just because he's your client. If I see any sign that you are, I'll treat you to another cup of my special blend!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't need to worry about that, Mr. Godot... <textEffects>(I have faith in Ron... I know he didn't do it...!)</textEffects>

<textEffects>If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!</textEffects>

<line>Ron:
<textEffects>When I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ron:
<textEffects>I panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Maya:
We heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's not much in this testimony either.
</line><line>Maya:
I betcha he's still hiding something.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't be surprised. We'll just have to draw it out of him.
</line><line>Maya:
I just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?
</line><line>Judge:
And what might this be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running... 
</line><line>Godot:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And according to this record, the buzzer was pushed once, at 1:02 AM!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh... Whaaat?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If Mr. Ron DeLite truly was the murderer... ...he would have run as soon as that buzzer sounded! After all, a security guard would've been heading his way!
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Let's remember who we're dealing with here. He probably had no idea there were security personnel in the building!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Up until one year ago, my client was working as a chief of security! There's no way he wouldn't have known about them!
</line><line>Godot:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Godot:
But! As it turns out, the guard never came.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That was nothing more than a coincidence! The fact that the guard was a pathetic loser... ...who had just gotten punched in the face by his ex's new boyfriend... ...and wasn't anywhere in the vicinity was not something Mr. DeLite could have known!
</line><line>Godot:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Again, remember who we're dealing with here. It's a sure bet that Mr. DeLite didn't even notice the buzzer going off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
This buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.
</line><line>Judge:
"Conscious"...? What do you mean by that!?
</line><line>Godot:
... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt "dazed"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.
</line><line>Judge:
Unconscious...? So he fainted!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!
</line><line>Godot:
S-So what are you trying to say...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!
</line><line>Godot:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Godot:
Th-This is preposterous! It was this kid... ...Ron DeLite, is the one who killed Kane Bullard!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then who pressed the buzzer?
</line><line>Godot:
I-It was... The victim, of course! He pressed the buzzer when the defendant attacked him! He didn't die right away! He must have held on long enough to push that button!
</line><line>Phoenix:
ACK!!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... So Kane Bullard sounded the buzzer himself... What is your opinion on this, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I need to prove that the <span style="color:#E16935">real criminal</textEffects> was there at the scene! But how? Can I prove that it <textEffects>wasn't Kane Bullard</textEffects> who sounded the buzzer?)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor! <textEffects>This piece of evidence proves that it wasn't the victim who sounded the buzzer!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-The emergency buzzer...? Is there some kind of clue on it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Absolutely not.
</line><line>Godot:
Hey, come on now... At least give some thought to what you say before opening your mouth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The fact that there are absolutely no clues... is itself the clue.
</line><line>Judge:
Now I'm the one who's clueless!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This button has no <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> on it. If Mr. Bullard had really pressed it himself... ...naturally, he would have left his fingerprints behind!
</line><line>Godot:
Phwoooooooooooh!!
</line><line>Godot:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Godot:
R...Ron DeLite... obviously wiped them off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why would he? A guard could have come in at any moment!
</line><line>Godot:
He touched that button! I know he did!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. DeLite, was dressed as <textEffects>Mask☆DeMasque</textEffects>. And Mask☆DeMasque... always wears <textEffects>gloves</textEffects>! What reason could he possibly have had to wipe the button free of fingerprints!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It would seem... I've been forced to eat crow!
</line><line>Maya:
I wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?
</line><line>Judge:
However, if the real killer was there at the scene... ...why would that person press the emergency buzzer?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Shouldn't they have run away without putting themselves in extra danger?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
......
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
What's with this awkward silence all of a sudden!?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It looks like you're fresh out of parlor tricks.
</line><line>Maya:
They're on to you, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
J-Just give me a minute to collect my thoughts...! The real culprit killed Mr. Bullard at around <textEffects>1 AM</textEffects>.
</line><line>Maya:
And Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The killer clobbered Mr. DeLite, and then sounded the buzzer.
</line><line>Maya:
Even though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Security was <span style="color:#E16935">supposed to respond</textEffects>"? Hmm...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
...Time's up, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you have to say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Very well then...
</line><line>Godot:
Oh ho... You've got some guts. I like that in an opponent.
</line><line>Judge:
Why did the "real killer" sound the emergency buzzer?

<line>Phoenix:
The killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running. And that was exactly what they wanted.
</line><line>Judge:
D-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.
</line><line>Maya:
Because he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were <textEffects>three people</textEffects> in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
...Hypothetically, yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now then... In this situation, if the real killer made an escape, what would happen? The only ones left in the room would be <textEffects>the victim</textEffects>, and <textEffects>Ron DeLite</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ron:
And... And if any security guards came running in at that time... They would think that I was the murderer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes! That was precisely the real killer's objective. To frame Ron DeLite for the murder!
</line><line>Godot:
Phwooooooooooh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It would seem... I've been made to eat my words once again!
</line><line>Maya:
Actually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.
</line><line>Ron:
M-Mr. Wright! Who was it!? Who was it that tried to frame me!? Err... Wait. Wait a second... I'm the one and only Mask☆DeM<textEffects>asque, so</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! You mean the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects> is...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We're going to drag that person in here right now!
</line><line>Maya:
But, but! Who is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't have any solid proof yet... but think about it. The killer knew <textEffects>Mr. DeLite's</textEffects> identity. And they also knew... ...that he had been <textEffects>called to KB Security</textEffects> that night... So, the killer used him to execute <textEffects>a well-crafted plan to murder Kane Bullard</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright. <textEffects>Who was it framed Mr. Ron DeLite for the murder of Kane Bullard!?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Detective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.
</line><line>Godot:
Ace Detective...
</line><line>Ron:
Luke Atmey...
</line><line>Judge:
You mean... Mask☆DeMasque did it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, the person being tried in the court next to us... ...is not Mask☆DeMasque at all. He is, in actuality... the true murderer of Kane Bullard!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!! M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Theft</textEffects> and <textEffects>murder</textEffects>... Which is the more serious crime?
</line><line>Judge:
They're not even close. <textEffects>Murder</textEffects> is the more serious crime, of course! It's a capital crime subject to a capital punishment.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please remember the trial from yesterday, if you would. When Luke Atmey confessed, there was a huge commotion in the courtroom.
</line><line>Godot:
Of course. A famous detective was unmasked as... well, as Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Instead of being convicted of <textEffects>murder</textEffects>, he was found guilty of <textEffects>grand larceny</textEffects>. ...That was his true objective all along.
</line><line>Judge:
To be found "<textEffects>guilty</textEffects>"...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mask☆DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being <textEffects>found guilty</textEffects> as Mask☆DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.
</line><line>Judge:
A <textEffects>guilty verdict</textEffects>... AS AN ALIBI!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Godot:
You know... It's almost time.
</line><line>Judge:
F-For what?
</line><line>Godot:
For Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire attorney. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Am I really sure about this...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! A bet's only good when your life's the ante.
</line><line>Ron:
Mr. Wright! I... I believe in you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite...
</line><line>Ron:
So... So... Please. I'M BEGGING YOOOOOOU!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Thanks... But... My decision will determine the rest of your life! Can I really risk your life like this...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>...Phoenix...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(Wh-What was that...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>...Don't stray Phoenix......For your client... Take the path of trust...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-That voice... It-It sounds like... M-Mia...!)</textEffects> Your Honor! The defense requests an immediate recess!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! So that's your answer, huh?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. I've decided as well. This court will now take a 20 minute recess. ...Mr. Wright. When we return, please summon Mr. Luke Atmey to the stand!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor!

Is it true that detective is the real killer?
</line><line>Phoenix:

But, wasn't he at Lordly Tailor that night?

Judge:
Now then, this court is back in session. Mr. Luke Atmey. Please take the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Atmey:
Well well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your <textEffects>perfect alibi</textEffects>. An alibi by the name of "Mask☆DeMasque"...
</line><line>Atmey:
I'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.
</line><line>Judge:
You've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask☆DeMasque...
</line><line>Atmey:
Indeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to "protect" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you continue to insist that you are, in fact, "Mask☆DeMasque"?
</line><line>Atmey:
...Of course.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?
</line><line>Atmey:
One without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.
</line><line>Judge:
Um, thanks...
</line><line>Godot:
Alright, Mr. Atmey... The night of the murder... Speak! ...We're listening!
</line><line>Atmey:
As you wish... Sir Prosecutor.

<line>Atmey:
I was stealing the urn as Mask☆DeMasque, just as I announced I would...
I had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.
A photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.
The time at which the camera captured Mask☆DeMasque was the same time as the murder!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems the main point of discussion will be this <textEffects>photo of the crime scene</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Everything else up until now was all part of his plan. There has to be a secret to this picture as well!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atmey:
Even the great Mask☆DeMasque cannot be in two places at once. Now then, if you'll excuse me. I have a verdict to receive.

It has to be, or he couldn't have killed Mr. Bullard at KB Security.

But... I'm not really spotting anything unusual.
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are two possibilities... Either the <textEffects>Mask☆DeMasque</textEffects> in the photo is a fake... Or the <textEffects>photo itself</textEffects> is.

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Andrews:
Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Andrews:
I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I myself was there the night the theft took place, and saw the statue in that spot. If this picture was truly taken on that night, then that statue should've been there!

</line><line>Godot:
But when I went there the day after the theft... ...that statue of the old bag was sitting in the corner.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Perhaps it was somehow pushed there accidentally...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, this statue is slightly larger than yourself and quite heavy. It would take more than an accidental push to move it that distance!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! In that case... Can you prove it? Can you give us the "rhyme and reason" as to why that statue was moved that night?
</line><line>Maya:
C-Can you do it, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Never mind who moved it... The real question is "<span style="color:#E16935">why did they move it</textEffects>"...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer. <textEffects>Now then, <span style="color:#E16935">who</textEffects> was the one that <textEffects>moved the golden statue</textEffects> on the night of the crime?</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!
</line><line>Atmey:
Come now, Sir Lawyer! There you go again on one of your strange delusions...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What basis do you have for your strange delusions!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It's very simple. The witness was the only one in the basement warehouse that night.
</line><line>Atmey:
That is indeed very simple... However! Why would I want to move a heavy golden statue?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">reason</textEffects> for moving the golden statue... Here's where our battle finally begins.)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What reason did the witness have to move that statue!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The reason can be found here in this photograph.
</line><line>Atmey:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Luke Atmey, You pretended to be Mask☆DeMasque... ...to create an alibi by showing you were "<textEffects>at Lordly Tailor that night</textEffects>".
</line><line>Atmey:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But this photograph contains a single, <textEffects>fatal flaw</textEffects>. If the statue had been there, your <textEffects>lie</textEffects> would be exposed like cheap film at a drug store... That is why you moved the statue!
</line><line>Judge:
A single, fatal <textEffects>flaw</textEffects>?
</line><line>Godot:
Interesting theory... Please enlighten us. <textEffects>Just where in this picture does this "lie" exist!?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Naturally... the lie in this photo is the <textEffects>timestamp</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What do you mean!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!
</line><line>Atmey:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
But what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember if you will, Your Honor. <textEffects>When</textEffects> was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well...
</line><line>Godot:
The statue was taken down to the warehouse on <textEffects>the day of the crime</textEffects>... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an <textEffects>alibi for that time</textEffects>... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!
</line><line>Godot:
Wh-What the...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!
</line><line>Atmey:
... GWAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?
</line><line>Atmey:
One moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What's that...?
</line><line>Atmey:
The data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... It's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!
</line><line>Atmey:
Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!
</line><line>Godot:
...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.
</line><line>Judge:
However! the defense has a very good point!
</line><line>Godot:
"A good point"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.
</line><line>Maya:
Um, I think you've got your "points" mixed up with your other "points"...
</line><line>Godot:
...So you say this photograph was taken <textEffects>ahead of time</textEffects>. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which is...?
</line><line>Godot:
That it's only... a "possibility". Men that are trapped by the chains of "maybe"... ...can never reach their dreams!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's very true!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!
</line><line>Godot:
Hey! Mr. DeMasque!
</line><line>Atmey:
Y-Yes!?
</line><line>Godot:
If there's no funny business in your actions as Mask☆DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy. So let's hear it.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. Please provide this court with your testimony. About your plan to steal the Sacred Urn!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Sacred Urn Heist --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atmey:
I first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.
The urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.
Hence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...
I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.
I then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!
At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
That's pretty much all stuff we've heard before, isn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, but we will find the truth hidden in the nuggets of new information he gave.
</line><line>Judge:
Witness... You're sure there are no mistakes this time?
</line><line>Atmey:
...Zvarri.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then! Mr. Wright! You may begin your cross-examination!

</line>


<line>Maya:
Hmmm... Not a lot to go on, is there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That detective's been covering his tracks... There's only one thing we need to prove in this cross-examination...! That he took this photo <textEffects>well before the actual night of the crime</textEffects>.
</line><line>Maya:
Alright then... How do we do that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's one thing that Atmey stated very clearly. That he had <textEffects>never seen the urn</textEffects> before he stole it...
</line><line>Maya:
We need to prove that he's lying...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque... ...then you also wrote this calling card, correct?
</line><line>Atmey:
But of course.
</line><line>Godot:
Is there a problem with that calling card?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Allow me to read a passage from the calling card that Mask☆DeMasque had written. "Take good care of the <textEffects>speckled urn</textEffects>." Now, the "speckled" here... ...surely refers to this pink pattern on the Sacred Urn.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that is true... But so what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Truth be told, there is no way that Mask☆DeMasque could have known about this pattern.
</line><line>Atmey:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This pink, spotted pattern on the urn... is actually nothing more than <textEffects>paint stains</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Paint stains...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And these stains did not appear... ...until <textEffects>after</textEffects> the urn had been taken to Lordly Tailor!
</line><line>Atmey:
Hhhmph...!
</line><line>Godot:
I'm not finding this joke to be very funny, Mr. Trite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The day that the Sacred Urn was taken to the warehouse... ...the urn was broken due to human error, or should I say an error-prone human. And that's when the pink paint got on the urn!
</line><line>Godot:
Urghh...! Y-You can't be serious...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And yet this "calling card" clearly mentions the paint pattern. Which means... Detective Atmey had seen this urn <textEffects>long before the crime ever took place</textEffects>! In fact, he saw it when this fake photo was taken!
</line><line>Godot:
...Phwoooooh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And because this photo is a fake... ...your alibi for the night of the murder no longer holds water!
</line><line>Atmey:
Gwagwagwagwawaaaah!

...Witness. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
</line><line>Atmey:
Grr... Mmm... Nnn...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright! That did it! He's broken!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Um, Nick, I think it's still a little early for a victory pose.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It's so sad... No one has any conviction these days...
</line><line>Judge:
C-Conviction... you say?
</line><line>Godot:
Yesterday, we all decided unanimously that this man was Mask☆DeMasque. And now, we're calling him a murderer... You don't think we're being a tad fickle?
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's a good point!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No way! Don't fall for that too, Your Honor!
</line><line>Godot:
You say that Luke Atmey was the one who killed Kane Bullard? Then let me ask you this. Why would he do that?
</line><line>Atmey:
Heh heh heh heh heh... An excellent point.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Atmey:
Motive, Mr. Wright! Motive! Might you my merry murderous motive manifest?
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! He's getting his second wind!
</line><line>Judge:
If he prepared an alibi and pinned his crime on Ron DeLite as you say... ...he must have had a very <textEffects>strong motive</textEffects> for murder!
</line><line>Godot:
The only one with any motive we've seen is Ron DeLite. Isn't that right, Detective!?
</line><line>Atmey:
Indeed. According to my own research, the boy's motive is clear!
</line><line>Judge:
Without a motive, it's nearly impossible to prove guilt in a murder case! Now then... Maybe you can enlighten us to what the defendant's motives were.
</line><line>Atmey:
Thank you, Sir Old-timer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They're doing everything they can to make Ron look suspicious... Despite our lack of hard information, this may be our only chance...)</textEffects>

<line>Atmey:
I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.
Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!
It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.
And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!
Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.
That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So the victim, Kane Bullard, blackmailed the defendant...?
</line><line>Godot:
This is the blackmail letter found in the defendant's apartment. A handwriting test confirms that <textEffects>Mr. Bullard was indeed the one who wrote the letter</textEffects>.

Y-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...

In that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...

<line>Phoenix:
Take a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the "Tear of Emanon", the <textEffects>stolen jewel</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What about it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The problem is this jewel's <textEffects>color</textEffects>.
</line><line>Godot:
<textEffects>Color</textEffects>...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was "blue". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. "I'll take that <textEffects>red diamond</textEffects> you received the other day."
</line><line>Judge:
R-<textEffects>Red</textEffects>...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which means! The "<textEffects>red diamond</textEffects>" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the "Tear of Emanon" that Mask☆DeMasque stole at all!
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
And your point is, Mr. Trite!? So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else. ...That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Trite?
</line><line>Judge:
That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Maya:
Well? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes. <textEffects>This is who Kane Bullard was actually blackmailing!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Naturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!
</line><line>Atmey:
... Do you have some sort of basis for that claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have been personally involved in every single Mask☆DeMasque case. And in the last case, you "recovered" what was stolen... ...and received a "jewel"... ...as your reward.
</line><line>Godot:
A-A jewel...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Probably the one wrapped conspicuously around your finger. That <textEffects>red diamond</textEffects> ring!
</line><line>Atmey:
Unn... Ggg...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is the diamond referred to in the letter! Which means that Kane Bullard wrote that letter in order to blackmail YOU!

Aaaaahhhhh!

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh... I don't like the way he said that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Kane Bullard blackmailing Luke Atmey? Are you for real?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes. I am.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Come on, stand up to him!
</line><line>Godot:
Then answer me this! The blackmail letter contains the following passage. "If you don't want your <textEffects>identity</textEffects> revealed to the world"...!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, it certainly does.
</line><line>Godot:
Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's "<textEffects>identity</textEffects>" public knowledge! An "identity" he wanted to keep a secret. So just what was that identity!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Atmey killed Kane Bullard because he was afraid of his secret becoming known...! What was the "<span style="color:#E16935">identity</textEffects>" he wanted to keep secret...?)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
This is what it all comes down to, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The "<textEffects>identity</textEffects>" that Luke Atmey wanted to so desperately keep secret was his identity as...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Luke Atmey... was a blackmailer!
</line><line>Atmey:
...!

</line><line>Godot:
Hey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?
</line><line>Maya:
Ugh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! <textEffects>Ron DeLite</textEffects> was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?
</line><line>Ron:
Yes. Just a few days after the "Tear of Emanon" heist...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ron:
After that, I started getting <textEffects>the plans</textEffects> in the mail. After that, I received plans from some very kind person! <textEffects>Incredibly detailed plans</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
"Detailed plans"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask☆DeMasque...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!
</line><line>Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What is?
</line><line>Atmey:
When you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. "Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions"... Am I wrong?
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-H-H-How did you...!?
</line><line>Atmey:
You say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask☆DeMasque...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, yes.
</line><line>Atmey:
Ron DeLite started receiving plans from his <textEffects>second crime onward</textEffects>, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Good point.. You certainly couldn't have blackmailed him otherwise.
</line><line>Godot:
In that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence. <textEffects>During the first crime, how did Luke Atmey know that Ron DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I think I see it...
</line><line>Atmey:
See what...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. "Gets into lots of mischief trying to be the center of attention."
</line><line>Atmey:
Wh-What do you mean...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...This newspaper clipping. It has a picture of you and Ron DeLite on his guard uniform. It seems that Mask☆DeMasque didn't just disappear into thin air. He just took off his outfit... and hid it in a <textEffects>bucket</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
That... That sounds far too stupid to be true.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Correct. With tricks like that he couldn't fool a baby, let alone an Ace Detective. And that's when you figured it out, Mr. Atmey! That's when you learned that under his mask, Mask☆DeMasque was really Ron DeLite!
</line><line>Atmey:
Ggg... Nnn... Urkk...
</line><line>What the... Wasn't he supposed to be Mask☆DeMasque...?
</line><line>Not only that... it looks like he wasn't even an Ace Detective!
</line><line>I can't believe it. He was just a slimy blackmailer...
</line><line>What a fraud! Trying to pass himself off as an Ace Detective...
</line><line>Atmey:
............ Why you! How dare you expose me like that...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Atmey:
Why I... I mean, I've never blackmailed anyone in my life...! I-I'm a famous and proud Ace Detective, and... and also Mask☆DeMasque! Why can't you understand that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid you are neither a proud thief, nor an Ace Detective. You're a blackmailer and a murderer. That is your true identity!
</line><line>Atmey:
Wh-Wh-Why YOUUUUUU! How dare you even dare toimplythatonesosmartandcapableasIcouldeverfalltosuchlowlydepths! Whynottrydoingsomethingyourselveswiththosebigmouthsofyours!

It would seem we've finally gotten to the real answer.

That was... quite a performance by Mr. Atmey...

</line><line>Godot:
It appears... that your claws weren't quite sharp enough, Mr. Trite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh... Where do you...!?
</line><line>Godot:
It's true that you've proven a lot of things. ...Things like Luke Atmey was a filthy blackmailer. ...And that he wasn't at Lordly Tailor the night of the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right! That's why he's the one who killed Mr. Bull--
</line><line>Godot:
But... There's still one thing you have yet to prove.
</line><line>Judge:
What's that...?
</line><line>Godot:
Just because he wasn't at the warehouse doesn't mean he was at the murder scene. Therefore, if you can't prove that this pitiful excuse for a man was at KB Security... ...then I don't see how a verdict can be delivered!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No... No waaaaaaaaaay!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! ...Well, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-This is it... This is the final round...!)</textEffects> I've got to prove that Atmey was at Mr. Bullard's office on that night...
</line><line>Maya:
B-But...! Can you really prove that?
</line><line>Godot:
That's long enough. Mr. Trite... I want to hear your answer.

That night, Luke Atmey was at KB Security, and the defense...

Unfortunately... That's as far as you go, Mr. Trite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Godot:
I won't allow for any more testimony... That's what I mean.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What...?
</line><line>Godot:
Have you forgotten? Luke Atmey is here after we interrupted his own trial. And you have failed to prove that he committed the murder! I think it's time for this witness to return to his own trial... ...and face his guilty verdict as Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No...
</line><line>Atmey:
Well now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! That's enough deliberation over this witness!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I-I can't believe this...! At this rate, Ron is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
D-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...
</line><line>Phoenix:
By then, it'll be too late...
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? Wh-Why!?
</line><line>Godot:
"<textEffects>Double Jeopardy</textEffects>"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.
</line><line>Maya:
"<textEffects>Double Jeopardy</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Judge:
"Should a defendant be tried and <textEffects>found innocent</textEffects> in court... That defendant <textEffects>cannot be tried again</textEffects> for the same crime." This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.
</line><line>Godot:
Mr. Atmey will be <textEffects>found guilty</textEffects> in a matter of minutes. Guilty as "Mask☆DeMasque". Which means...
</line><line>Judge:
He will be <textEffects>innocent</textEffects> as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.
</line><line>Maya:
No way...
</line><line>Judge:
The fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
U... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!

It's true that the witness made some "remarks". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.

M-Mr. Godot! What are you...?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, Luke Atmey. I'll allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks.

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Last Testimony --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atmey:
Indeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.
I had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.
I had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.
My brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.
And thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.
I was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.
The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?
The victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.
Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.
And, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.
Zvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This testimony actually seems to hold up pretty well...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The witness's earlier remarks do not appear to have been hastily prepared. All of his points have been explained, and none of them seem to contradict anything.
</line><line>Atmey:
...But of course.
</line><line>Judge:
But... How did you know about the emergency buzzer?
</line><line>Atmey:
The police investigation documents went directly through me... And I always look over all the documents. It's elementary, Sir Lawyer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grr...
</line><line>Godot:
Are you going to make even more trouble for us now, Sir Lawyer...?

I will not allow any of your usual shenanigans, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
We cannot postpone Luke Atmey's trial any longer. This is... your last chance!
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-Hang on a sec! Just one chance...!?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It seems that the party's about to begin.
</line><line>Mia:
...Well, Phoenix?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There isn't any evidence that contradicts with that testimony!
</line><line>Mia:
...So it would seem.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean, "So it would seem"...?
</line><line>Mia:
Listen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a <textEffects>case-breaking contradiction</textEffects>... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.
</line><line>Godot:
...Cup number 17. The last cup. It seems like the time has come to put an end to this trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to find a <span style="color:#E16935">fatal contradiction</textEffects> in this testimony... And... I need to point it out without presenting evidence! Which means all I can do is find the contradictory remark and <textEffects>press</textEffects> it...!)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
Remember! You only get one chance!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your final cross-examination!
</line>

<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Last Testimony --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>Indeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>I had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>I had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>My brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>And thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>I was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>The victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>And, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>Zvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This cross-examination is the only chance I have to nail him! Somewhere there's a <span style="color:#E16935">huge contradiction</textEffects>, and I've got to find it...!)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
As far as I can see, there is no evidence that contradicts his testimony. All you can do is <textEffects>press</textEffects> him. And you only get one shot.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey. About this last remark...
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
...You still don't get it, do you, Trite? This isn't the time to be pressing the witness on every little statement.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid you're the one who still doesn't get it, Mr. Godot. 
</line><line>Godot:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey. It seems you have finally admitted... ...that <textEffects>you were in the CEO's office</textEffects>, on the night of the murder.
</line><line>Atmey:
H-How can you say that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's review your testimony, shall we, Mr. Atmey? "The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why? Mr. DeLite was <textEffects>wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit</textEffects>." Is that correct?
</line><line>Atmey:
I-Indeed! That's what I said! My deductions are absolutely foolproof...
</line><line>Phoenix:
More like your deductions prove that you're a fool.
</line><line>Atmey:
...I, I'm sorry. Whatever do you mean?
</line><line>Godot:
For some reason, I'm starting to get really thirsty...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>When</textEffects> exactly did we learn the fact that... ...Ron DeLite was dressed as Mask☆DeMasque when he went to the scene of the crime?
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That was... Um...
</line><line>Godot:
It was... just a few hours ago. Back when my sixth cup was looking at me with a cold stare.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ron:
Huh? Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? I'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
That's right. The defendant had yet to tell anyone else this fact before this morning. Therefore, the <textEffects>only people</textEffects> who should know this are <textEffects>those who have been watching this trial</textEffects>.
</line><line>Atmey:
Grr... Nrgh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you understand now, Detective Atmey? There is no way that you should have known about that!
</line><line>Atmey:
Ah... AAAAYEEEEHHH!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were in the next courtroom, being tried as Mask☆DeMasque! So then, enlighten us! Just how did you know about that piece of information!?
</line><line>Atmey:
Urk...! W-Well...
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
C-Come on! This detective must have known about it! He probably had plenty of chances to find out beforehand!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
And it's those "chances" that I want to discuss next! That night, "Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit." There is <textEffects>one, and only one way</textEffects>... ...for Detective Atmey to have found that out.
</line><line>Judge:
Only one...
</line><line>Godot:
...One way, you say!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please remember, if you will, Mr. DeLite's testimony!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ron:
When I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
For a second, my client witnessed the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>.
</line><line>Godot:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Godot:
But Mr. DeLite never saw him! There's no way to tell whether or not the "real killer" was Luke Atmey...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's with that statement that I'll <textEffects>turn this case on its head</textEffects>!
</line><line>Godot:
J-Just what are you implying!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Mr. DeLite saw the real killer," correct? Now, if you turn that statement around... ...it stands to follow that the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects> had also "<textEffects>seen</textEffects>" Ron DeLite!
</line><line>Godot:
I-Impossible...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Atmey, you saw Mask☆DeMasque at the <textEffects>murder scene</textEffects> that night! You saw him when you killed Kane Bullard and assaulted Ron DeLite! That was the only way you could have known what Ron was wearing!
</line><line>Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...
</line><line>Judge:
...That's the same line you gave yesterday.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... I think there's a little more meaning behind it this time.
</line><line>Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
What an awfully complicated incident... Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey, who was in turn, blackmailing Ron DeLite. And upon killing his blackmailer, Luke Atmey tried to frame Ron DeLite. He then claimed to be guilty as Mask☆DeMasque in order to escape his true crime...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And to that end, he came up with this plan... ...to use the "<textEffects>Double Jeopardy</textEffects>" rule when making his alibi.
</line><line>???:
Umm...
</line><line>Judge:
At any rate... It would seem we've finally found the truth.
</line><line>???:
Excuse me...
</line><line>Judge:
I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man... ...Besmirching him with the title of "murderer"!
</line><line>???:
...Don't ignore meeeeeee!
</line><line>Judge:
...Oh. I didn't realize you were there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why wouldn't he be...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
Um... About the verdict...
</line><line>Judge:
I know. You never committed any murder.
</line><line>Ron:
That's right! I'm so glad you understand that! But... I, um... I really am <textEffects>Mask☆DeMaaaaasque</textEffects>!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Huh?
</line><line>Ron:
So, thanks to that trial yesterday, I'm <textEffects>innocent</textEffects> now, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh...
</line><line>Ron:
What was it you said? "<textEffects>Double Jeopardy</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Judge:
Now that you mention it...
</line><line>Godot:
I've been careless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Careless...?)</textEffects> Um, What do you think, Mia?
</line><line>Mia:
As the defendant says, the rule of "Double Jeopardy" is absolute. A defendant can never be tried twice for a crime in which he was once found innocent.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then... Mask☆DeMasque is really <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>?
</line><line>Mia:
For now... it would seem so.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(F-For now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then! This court finds the defendant...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>
Ron:
Boy, this is really lucky... Wait, err, I... That isn't so good after all. You see the thing is, I still am Mask☆<textEffects>DeMasque after all</textEffects>

Mia:
You did it, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks, Mia! It's been a long time, hasn't it?
</line><line>Mia:
...Yeah. It's because Maya doesn't call on me much these days.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh?
</line><line>Mia:
I'm just joking, Phoenix. Don't take everything so seriously. But on the other hand, Maya... She seems kind of lost these days.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean about becoming the Master of the Kurain Channeling School?
</line><line>Mia:
Becoming the Master... means saying goodbye to our mother.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean Misty Fey...?
</line><line>Mia:
...Watch over her, will you Phoenix?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course.
</line><line>Mia:
Well then... See you around.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mia...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
Ah! M-Mr. Wright! Um... I, Uh... I don't know what to say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Congratulations, Mr. DeLite.
</line><line>Ron:
Th-Th-Thank you so much! ... Err, no, wait. Nothing really matters anymore though, now that all of t<textEffects>his has happened</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Come on! Just be happy already!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya...
</line><line>Maya:
You've been cleared of the murder charges and got off as Mask☆DeMasque to boot!
</line><line>Ron:
But, in exchange... I lost everything.
</line><line>Maya:
...Huh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Ron:
Stealing security information from KB Security, becoming Mask☆DeMasque... I did it all for one reason... For her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean your wife, Desirée?
</line><line>Ron:
She hates <textEffects>criminals</textEffects> more than anything.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, she was once held hostage by some robbers, wasn't she?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
She always said how she hated sneaky criminals... I knew that. I knew that, but... Once I got fired from KB Security and lost all the money I had... ...she wouldn't have any reason to stay with me. I thought, she would leave me for sure.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, that's why you became Mask☆DeMasque...?
</line><line>Ron:
Yes... But, it's all over now... A broken bowl can never be put back together!
</line><line>Maya:
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right.
</line><line>Ron:
R-Really!? Can we go back to the way things were!?
</line><line>Maya:
You'll be fine! And Nick can prove it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can? I kind of wish you would check with me first...)</textEffects> <textEffects>Mr. DeLite, even if a bowl is broken, there is always a way to put it back together.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Desirée:
Nicky boy...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Desirée:
I'm really glad I asked you to defend my Ronnie. Thank you so much! I'll never forget what you've done for us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, well, um... Take care of yourself.
</line><line>Desirée:
You too, Nicky boy. ...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(*gulp*... I can feel my face going red.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Congratulations! ... *gasp!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Talk about bad timing.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Nick! How could you!? With another man's wife! In front of Mystic Maya! No no no! You've got it all wrong! I'll NEVER forgive you!! Never! Ever!
</line>
<hr />
<line>So just as the case came to a close, so too did my consciousness. Ron said, "a broken bowl can never be put back together." But I know that's not true. I mean, just look. Here's a perfect example of one that was put back together even better than before.
