Buckler:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! The ship's doctor and Azura were <textEffects>romantically involved</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Athena:
Well, that's my theory, but I don't actually know if it's really true.
</line><line>Buckler:
Azura would never get involved with that cod-awful ship's doctor! But I do admit... they were friends... But would Azura send Dr. Crab videos, I wonder...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Videos? What do you mean?
</line><line>Buckler:
Azura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm. This is an interesting bit of information...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>TV Phone updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
So TV phones can shoot videos, too, huh? My dumb phone sure can't. 
</line><line>Buckler:
These TV phones are amazing! They can even record sounds you and I can't hear! All the equipment we use at Shipshape Aquarium is high-tech. The ship's doctor sends away for all kinds of electronics.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So all the high-tech stuff is Dr. Crab's doing, huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Buckler:
Anyway, I still highly trout Azura's boyfriend was the ship's doctor. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Dr. Crab found a <textEffects>charm</textEffects> yesterday, and he was really shaken by it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Crab:
Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
That charm looked just like your keepsake of Azura.
</line><line>Buckler:
Yeah, well... She did say she and her boyfriend had matching charms... Was the ship's doctor and Azura really a couple...? I-I can't believe it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think Dr. Crab will be called as a witness today. There are still so many unanswered questions... ...but I hope to solve them all in today's trial. 
</line><line>Buckler:
I believe in you two! I know you can do it.
</line><line>Athena:
And we WILL, Sasha! We promise!
</line>

<line>
</line>
<center><b>Day 2</b><b>Court Is Now In Session</b><b>All Rise</b></center>
<line>
Judge: 
Court is now in session for the trial of Sasha Buckler.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready-- AAAAAGH!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Ready.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Now I'm completely thrown off...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very good. It appears both the prosecution and the defense are ready. Yesterday, it was proven that the orca was not guilty and that the victim fell to his death. Prosecutor Blackquill, did your investigation of the orca pool area turn up anything?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Hmph. It did. We found a <textEffects>bloodstain</textEffects> from the victim at the bottom of the pool. ...On this.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my. What a frightening-looking rock. And you say it has a bloodstain on it? Hmm. Just looking at it gives me the willies. So can we assume that there was no water in the pool at the time of the incident?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Very good. What a clever little deduction.
</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho! Well, it's nice to get a compliment from the prosecution for a change. 
</line><line>Athena:
Prosecutor Blackquill has completely tamed the judge with his carrot-and-stick approach.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...I guess I should've brought a few carrots of my own.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Right. Moving along. I have prepared a witness. Buckler was the only one who entered that room when there was no water in the pool. The witness will prove that. ............Come to the stand, witness. 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Blackquill:
............Name and occupation. 
</line><line>Crab:
Dr. Herman Cr--
</line><line>Sniper:
Peep!
</line><line>Crab:
Sniper! Stay in there!
</line><line>Judge:
And who is that cute little creature?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Such a restless bird. Quite unlike Taka.
</line><line>Taka:
Graaaaaw!
</line><line>Sniper:
Peep!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow... Chalk one up for Taka... He shut Sniper up with a single sound.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
Son of a gun... Dr. Herman Crab, Shipshape Aquarium's veterinarian.
</line><line>Judge:
...And could you tell us the name of your cute little friend there, as well?
</line><line>Athena:
Your Honor, please focus on the case!
</line><line>Judge:
But it's important to learn all we can about the witness!
</line><line>Crab:
This is Sniper. 
</line><line>Sniper:
*peep!* *peep, peeeeep!* *peep, peep, peep, peep!*
</line><line>Crab:
She's the offspring of a penguin named Rifle. Sniper lives in my hair. She might cause a commotion now and then, but please try to ignore her. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
I was originally going to call the animal keeper to the stand... ...but he refused to testify, so I settled on the veterinarian. ............Now tell us. Why was the defendant in the orca pool room when the water was drained?
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room -- </textEffects></center>
<line>Crab: 
In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.
Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.
During cleaning, the pool water is drained.
While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.
The pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm. And your claim is that the victim was made to fall to his death during the cleaning? 
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Hmph. Only Buckler and the owner had the security card necessary to enter the orca pool room. And we already know from the security company's record of card usage... ...that the defendant was in the orca pool room during the time of cleaning. The witness's testimony and the record of security card usage are conclusive evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
So no one beside the defendant was at the scene, and the water in the pool was drained.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh-oh... The judge already seems to be leaning toward the other side.
</line><line>Athena:
We have to strike fast... Your Honor, we're ready for our cross-examination now!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! Yes, of course... Please proceed, then.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The power of youth comes in handy at times like these.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --</textEffects></center>
<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>During cleaning, the pool water is drained.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>The pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Crab: 
<textEffects>If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
If the water in the pool is drained, you say the orca could die. But is that necessarily true?
</line><line>Crab:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is a way to let the water out without harming the orca, isn't there? Your Honor, please allow me to submit this photograph.
</line><line>Judge:
............Oh! This is...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see, there is no water around the skull rock area. With the pool in this state, the victim could have been made to fall to his death. However, there IS water on the other side of the partition... ...and Orla looks just fine.
</line><line>Crab:
............Son of a gun.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In other words, if the partition is set up at the bottom of the pool... ...the water can be drained without doing Orla any harm!
</line><line>Judge:
Are you implying the water could have been drained at a time other than during cleaning?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, there is that possibility.
</line><line>Athena:
Dr. Crab is shaking... Looks like he has something to hide. Could it have something to do with the calendar note about <textEffects>meeting with the victim</textEffects>? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It might. I'll submit to the judge. Your Honor! Please take a look at this calendar.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, you waved that around in court yesterday. No need to drag out your souvenir today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually... I would like you to make note of the entry for the day of the incident!
</line><line>Judge:
Let me see, here... "<textEffects>Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 am.</textEffects>" This note is about a meeting planned with the victim!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense would like to argue that, at the time of that meeting... ...the pool may have been drained of its water!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whose calendar is that?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............It belongs to Dr. Herman Crab. Isn't that right, Dr. Crab?
</line><line>Crab:
Son of a gun... SO you suspect me, do you?!
</line><line>Judge:
What is the meaning of this calendar entry, Dr. Crab? Explain yourself!
</line><line>Crab:
Fine. I was supposed to meet Jack at the orca pool at that time. But... I ended up not going.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you're saying you simply broke your promise? You can't get out of it that easily. I believe you have some explaining to do.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Your blade is sharper than I thought, Wright-dono. But your cut was shallow--a mere surface scratch. There's a saying amongst prisoners. "Do not see, hear nor speak to smooth-talking lawyers." If you think the witness is suspicious, show your proof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! <textEffects>(The calendar alone isn't good enough, huh? I have to prove the victim <span style="color:#E16935">could have</textEffects> fallen to his death at that <textEffects>7 AM</textEffects> meeting time!)</span> 
</line><line>Athena:
Let's put our heads together, Boss! The victim could've fallen <textEffects>during cleaning, when the pool was completely drained</textEffects>... ...or, <textEffects>using the partition</textEffects>, it could've been <textEffects>at 7 AM, with the water partially drained</textEffects>. What would be the major difference in circumstance between these two possibilities?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... What circumstance was different...? The answer could really tell us something... What circumstance was different <span style="color:#E16935">between the two possibilities</textEffects> of cleaning and 7 AM?)</span>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
If the murder occurred at a time other than during cleaning, the orca must've been there! 
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, you're right! And that would mean... ...Orla <textEffects>witnessed</textEffects> the murder! 
</line><line>Blackquill:
What's this? You're sheathing your sword so soon? Stop yammering to each other and show me how you wield your sword!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, then. My sword is poised and ready. If the murder was committed at a time other than during cleaning time... ...then Orla must have been present at the scene. If I can prove that the murder happened right in front of Orla... ...then I can prove that Ms. Buckler is not guilty!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! Are you implying that the orca was a witness to the crime?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is exactly what I'm implying!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. And...? How do you intend to prove the orca witnessed the murder...? What are you going to do, put the orca on the stand and cross-examine her?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is a critical point. I'd better think about it carefully...)</textEffects> <textEffects>The defense will...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The defense will present evidence, evidence that will prove Orla witnessed the murder!
</line><line>Judge:
You're going to... present evidence? Knowing the defense, I thought surely you would try to cross-examine the orca... I must say I'm a little disappointed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gee, sorry to get your hopes up, Your Honor...)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's see this evidence, then. <textEffects>What evidence shows that the murder took place right in front of the orca?</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This photo indicates where we discovered <textEffects>luminol reactions</textEffects> yesterday. By accident, we got some of the luminol testing fluid on Orla. We were then very surprised to see... ...<textEffects>luminol reactions</textEffects> on Orla's body!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
So what of it? There's nothing odd about that. As was discussed in yesterday's trial, the orca was bleeding. Traces of the orca's blood were also found on the skull rock. The orca must have injured herself when she rammed the rock.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that cloud of blood Ms. DePlume saw... ...was from Orla head-butting the skull rock, was it?)</textEffects> 
</line><line><textEffects>Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.</textEffects> 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Those luminol reactions you saw on the orca are most likely from her head-butting. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But what's odd is the <textEffects>position</textEffects> of those bloodstains. Please take a good look at the photograph. Yesterday, Ms. DePlume said <textEffects>the blood disappeared when Orla put on the hat</textEffects>. That testimony indicated that Orla's injuries were under the hat area. However, these luminol reactions are in two entirely separate areas from her injuries. These bloodstains can't be Orla's own blood from when she was head-butting!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-Then where did the blood come from...? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's my firm belief that it's the <textEffects>victim's blood</textEffects>. The victim was killed right in front of Orla... ...and the victim's blood splattered onto Orla's body!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaagh! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now it finally all makes sense! Orla was a witness to the murder...! So THAT'S why...!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Orla? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
There's one more fact that indicates Orla was a <textEffects>witness</textEffects> to the murder.
</line><line>Judge:
There's more?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did. It's the only thing that makes sense! I have to present that evidence...! ...That evidence that proves the culprit thought Orla was a dangerous witness!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense would like to submit this evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
What's that? It looks like some sort of medicine...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a <textEffects>sleeping drug</textEffects>, Your Honor, a very powerful one. The sleeping drug was discovered in Orla's stomach yesterday. The culprit tried to drown Orla by putting her into a deep sleep!
</line><line>Judge:
Tried to drown the orca?! B-But... why? 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wright-dono... are you trying to tell this court... ...that the perpetrator tried to kill the orca off to prevent a witness from talking?! Do you really expect to defeat me with that feeble attack?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My sword has been drawn. I'm not about to sheathe my evidence now. Orcas have an enormous potential for intelligence. The possibility that Orla could somehow manage to reveal the truth can't be denied. The culprit believed in this possibility... and that's why they tried to kill her! ............Dr. Herman Crab. You purchased this sleeping drug, didn't you?
</line><line>Crab:
!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?! Does this mean the veterinarian tried to do away with the orca?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who but a veterinarian would better know how to disguise an orca's death? He could even prevent the police from examining Orla's body!
</line><line>Crab:
............Why, you... Are you actually accusing me of trying to murder the orca?! HOW DARE YOU?! HOW DARE YOU slander the noble profession of VETERINARIAN?! 
</line><line>Athena:
Eeeeeeek!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(E-Eeek...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
My goodness! One could cut the tension in this courtroom with a knife.
</line><line>Crab:
YES! I admit to purchasing that sleeping drug! However............ it was subsequently stolen from my lab.
</line><line>Athena:
That's such a flimsy excuse!
</line><line>Crab:
It's the truth. What else can I say? Any one of the crew members could have entered my lab. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess that weakens my evidence quite a bit...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
...Besides, think about it for a minute. Who was it that treated Orla after she swallowed the drug? It was I! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
But as I recall, it took you quite a while to give that treatment. You didn't even come on your own. We had to go get you.
</line><line>Crab:
............Son of a gun. You just remember all sorts of little details, don't you, Mr. Lawyer?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca pool and the lab are far apart. It's little wonder he didn't know Orla's condition.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Didn't know...? That's highly doubtful. As far apart as they were, Dr. Crab still had a way to know all about Orla's condition. <textEffects>The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>TORPEDO</textEffects>...
</line><line>Crab:
Gah! You just had to bring that up, didn't you?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
With this advanced data system, surely you would have known Orla's condition! 
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Wait just one minute. What is this "TORPEDO"?
</line><line>Judge:
Dr. Crab! How dare you bring a weapon of mass destruction into my courtroom!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The TORPEDO, or "TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer," is a data system. Until yesterday, only Dr. Crab and Mr. Shipley knew about the TORPEDO. It isn't legally approved in this country, so it was kept secret from the police.
</line><line>Judge:
I-It's illegal?! Dr. Crab! I demand an explanation!
</line><line>Crab:
............Son of a gun! You and your big mouth, Mr. Lawyer! Yes, it's true... I'm using an illegal system to monitor the creatures at the aquarium. The system uses sensors like these, and, yes, there's one in the orca pool, too. These sensors send sound waves through the water to gather data on the creatures. If it finds abnormalities in their condition, the TORPEDO alerts me with a sound.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my goodness! How very high-tech! But if it's illegal, I will not turn a blind eye. This matter will be appropriately dealt with at a separate time. Now then, Mr. Wright. Please continue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
With the TORPEDO, I'm sure Dr. Crab noticed the danger Orla was in... ...but he made no attempt to come to her aid on his own! And the reason for that is... that Dr. Crab wanted Orla dead!
</line><line>Crab:
............The TORPEDO didn't give me a warning message. That's why I didn't know there was anything wrong with Orla. The sensor in the orca pool wasn't working during the police's investigation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Can you prove that statement?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What's with him?)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Athena:
I guess this is all so high-tech for Prosecutor Blackquill that it's making him a little "funny." 
</line><line>Blackquill:
"Funny"...? Yes, I find this all very "funny." Witness, those "<textEffects>sensors</textEffects>" send sound waves through the water, correct? But what if there isn't any water?
</line><line>Crab:
Then they wouldn't work. They would automatically switch off.
</line><line>Blackquill:
I see... And where is the sensor in the orca pool located? 
</line><line>Crab:
I don't know. Jack is the one who attached it for me.
</line><line>Blackquill:
You don't know? Then I will tell you. The police found a sensor just like the one you just showed us. They found it attached to the table at the bottom of the pool. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Table...? Do you mean the table in this photograph?
</line><line>Blackquill:
That's right. ............Don't you get it yet, Wright-dono? The table is on the <textEffects>skull rock side</textEffects> of the partition. It's affixed to the bottom of the pool, and can't be moved. 
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! And so if the water was drained from the skull rock side of the pool...!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Precisely. Without water, the TORPEDO sensor would not work. Witness, when did that sensor automatically switch off?
</line><line>Crab:
Hang on. I'll look it up. The only times lately were during cleaning two days ago and the investigation yesterday. Of course I knew the pool would be drained while they cleaned it... ...but I had no idea they drained it for the investigation. No one let me know. That's why I didn't know about Orla's condition yesterday. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So Dr. Crab really did want to save Orla...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Heh heh. Did you hear that, Wright-dono? Yes, the water can be drained without harm to the orca if the partition is used. But if the water is drained from the skull rock side, the sensor turns itself off. If the sensor was always on except for during the cleaning and the investigation... ...it means there must have been water in the pool at all other times. It was never drained. In other words... no one but the defendant could have committed the crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! This completely shatters the defense's argument!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ggg... B-B-But... The fact still remains that Orla was nearly killed with Dr. Crab's sleeping drug!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
But aren't you forgetting one important question? When was the sleeping drug given to the orca?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...You're right. That hasn't been discussed yet, has it?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca pool is the scene of the murder. The police were there all day yesterday. The only way to give the drug to the orca undetected is to put it in her food. Yesterday, someone gave the orca food <textEffects>during the trial</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Someone did? I'm afraid I don't remember that.
</line><line>Blackquill:
You don't remember? You're not THAT old yet, are you? ............It was the defendant, <textEffects>Sasha Buckler</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaagh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Buckler:
Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweeeet!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So your argument is that Ms. Buckler is the one who gave the orca the drug?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The prosecution's argument hasn't changed. Buckler made the victim fall to his death and then manipulated the orca to pin it on her. Still not satisfied, she further planned to kill the orca with the sleeping drug!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm. I didn't hear any reports of Dr. Crab feeding Orla... Maybe he didn't have a hand in Orla's attempted murder after all... But is there anybody else who could've fed Orla, besides Sasha?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. If it's true the defendant is the one who fed the sleeping drug to the orca... ...then that places even more suspicion on her than ever.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense objects to the prosecution's claims!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Well, well. You still haven't admitted defeat?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill. I don't appreciate the way you only mention the parts that are convenient for you.
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Hmph.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The prosecutor failed to mention that Ms. Buckler wasn't the only one who fed Orla! As you will all recall, there was another person who gave Orla food.
</line><line>Athena:
O-Oh! You mean, that person...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like Athena remembers now, too.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
Congrats, Sasha!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
</line><line>???:
This is to celebrate! Eat it all up!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fwee, fweet!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Oh, Mr. Wright! No...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't want to believe it, either, but we can't ignore the truth... The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday. ...Marlon Rimes gave the orca a large quantity of food. If the sleeping drug was mixed in with that food... ...it could be given to the orca without arousing police suspicion!
</line><line>Judge:
N-Now that you mention it, I do remember that flip-flopper feeding the orca!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph! So you remembered, did you? I see the time for a true sword fight has come. I call Marlon Rimes to the stand!
</line><line>Crab:
............Mr. Lawyer. Both Miss Orca Lover and Marlon Rimes are important members of our crew. I don't want to suspect either of them, but I'm ready to accept whatever truth you find. Here. Take this. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
! That charm...!
</line><line>Athena:
It's the charm that matches the one Azura Summers had, isn't it? So you and Ms. Summers WERE romantically involved, weren't you, Dr. Crab? 
</line><line>Crab:
What? No, of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, but this doesn't belong to me. At the time, I thought it was Azura's, so I grabbed it... ...But it wasn't hers. Now it's up to you, Mr. Lawyer, to figure out whose charm it is.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I will. Thank you, Dr. Crab.
</line><line>Crab:
After all, I'm interested in the outcome of this trial, too...
</line><line>Judge:
Now, then. Please summon Marlon Rimes to the witness stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rimes:
Wh-What's going on? What's everybody makin' that face for? I haven't been watchin' the trial and nobody's told me anythin'.
</line><line>Judge:
Marlon Rimes. You are under suspicion for the attempted murder of the orca.
</line><line>Rimes:
............ I see... Well, if it's already out... 
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mr. Rimes...? <textEffects>(Is he really going to admit it?)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Rimes:
Fine. I'll tell the truth.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Truth -- </textEffects></center>
<line>Rimes:
Sasha is lyin' to protect that orca.
At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.
The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!
Orla killed the captain by bashin' him 30 feet high and makin' him slam down on the water!
So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now we're back to the orca again?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(............ I did not see THAT testimony coming...)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Athena:
Now wait just one minute! Yesterday, Orla was proven innocent! Besides, you said Orla was in the show pool during the cleaning!
</line><line>Rimes:
I didn't wanna sell Sasha out... That's I didn't tell the truth... But the fact is, all three of us--Sasha, the captain and me--were cleanin' the pool room.
</line><line>Athena:
But Dr. Crab and Ms. Buckler both said you were at the show stage...!
</line><line>Rimes:
...Well, the only thing Dr. Crab knew about the cleanin' was what I told him. I didn't give him a whole lot of details, either. Maybe he misunderstood. And Sasha is lyin' to protect the orca. She can't tell the truth. Sasha put blood on the skull rock herself to make a fake bloodstain. I think it's pretty brave of her to let herself get arrested to protect the orca. 
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Rimes! How can you lie like that?!
</line><line>Rimes:
It's the truth! Besides, wouldn't it be better for you if I wasn't lyin'? If the orca did it, you <textEffects>win your case</textEffects>!
</line><line>Athena:
What?!
</line><line>Judge:
............ This is all very hard to believe... ...but if Mr. Rimes's story is true... ...Ms. Buckler would be innocent, and the orca would be the killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
! <textEffects>(Meaning, if we turned our backs on Orla... ...we could save Sasha...?!)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Having a witness lie to save your own client? What a dirty, underhanded tactic, Wright-dono!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Yesterday, the defense proved Orla was not guilty. We have no intention of going back on our assertions now!
</line><line>Rimes:
What are ya sayin', Mr. Wright?! All ya gotta do is admit the orca did it, and Sasha goes free! Isn't a lawyer supposed to act in his client's best interest?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
But that wouldn't be acting in her interest. Ms. Buckler believes Orla is innocent. And we, of course, believe that Ms. Buckler herself is innocent, too. Acting in the client's best interest is an important part of our job as lawyers. Using dirty means to win a verdict would destroy our client's faith in us.
</line><line>Athena:
That's right! We believe in both Ms. Buckler's AND Orla's innocence!
</line><line>Rimes:
Huh?! I just don't understand how ya can treat a human and an orca equally. Sasha or the orca? You can only save one of them!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I don't know about that. I think I can save them both. All I have to do is disprove your testimony!
</line><line>Rimes:
Oh, yeah? Then go ahead and try.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I will do just that. <textEffects>(If I can't tear down his testimony, I won't be able to save both of them. I have to find a weak spot and start tearing!)</textEffects>

<line>Rimes: 
<textEffects>Sasha is lyin' to protect that orca.</textEffects>

<line>Rimes: 
<textEffects>At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Rimes: 
<textEffects>The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!</textEffects>

<line>Rimes: 
<textEffects>So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
Of course we don't believe Mr. Rimes's testimony...
</line><line>Athena:
But he's suggesting the murder took place in the orca pool... Unless we can disprove that, we won't be able to save both Orla and Sasha.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
When lies are piled on top of each other, contradictions start to emerge. ............This time is no different.
</line><line>Rimes:
Are ya sayin' there's some kind of inconsistency in my testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm saying. You claimed that the victim was sent flying about <textEffects>30 feet</textEffects> into the air. But the autopsy report states the cause of death was thought to be from <textEffects>a 65-foot fall</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rimes:
What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Additionally, in your testimony a moment ago... ...you said, "At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool." The pool is about 65 feet deep and there's about <textEffects>30 feet</textEffects> between the water and ceiling. If the pool was full of water as you claimed... ...it would be impossible for the victim to <textEffects>fall about 65 feet</textEffects>, as the autopsy states.
</line><line>Rimes:
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mr. Rimes claimed he was in the orca pool room so he could make these statements. But the truth must be he was at the show stage, just as Dr. Crab and Sasha testified!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I believe that brings us back around to "the orca didn't do it."
</line><line>Blackquill:
............I didn't believe the witness's testimony from the outset. I am grateful to you, Wright-dono, for shutting the witness up. As I thought, the only person who could have killed the victim is Sasha Buckler. That fact still remains, whether the witness was the one who tried to kill the orca or not.
</line><line>Rimes:
Son of a...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mr. Rimes was right about one thing. His testimony WAS advantageous to our case. But pointing out the contradiction in his statement will only drive us into a corner...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
As Prosecutor Blackquill said, suspicion against Ms. Buckler is now deepened.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh-oh! If I don't do something fast, the judge is going to find Sasha guilty!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! Isn't there anything we can do? There has to be a way to prove Sasha is innocent!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(At a time like this............ the thing to do is <span style="color:#E16935">turn my thinking around</textEffects>! Instead of trying to prove that <textEffects>Sasha couldn't have done it</textEffects>... ...I have to think about <textEffects>what made it possible for somebody else to have done it</textEffects>. As long as the crime scene is the orca pool room... ...then Sasha is the only one who could have committed the crime.)</span>
</line><line>Blackquill:
............No need for pity, Your Baldness. Just finish him off with a swift verdict.
</line><line>Judge:
It appears the defense has no objections. Very well. I will give my verdict--
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please hold off on that verdict!
</line><line>Judge:
But you were so quiet, Mr. Wright. Do you have something to say now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense has a counterargument!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You do?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... Pitiful. Such desperation. You look pale. Are you sure you're prepared to make this counterargument?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets..." I'll never forget those words, no matter how many years go by. Even though it's probably just a bluff, I'll give it to them with a smile!)</textEffects> ...What if the scene of the crime was somewhere else?
</line><line>Judge:
The scene of the crime?
</line><line>Rimes:
Somewhere else...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
What? You're finding fault with the police investigation now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
As I understand, the prosecution's argument is as follows. The scene of the crime was the <textEffects>orca pool room</textEffects>. Only the defendant and victim entered that room when there was no water in the pool. Therefore, only the defendant could have committed the crime.
</line><line>Blackquill:
...That is correct.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But of the scene of the crime was NOT the orca pool room... ...then <textEffects>somebody other than the defendant</textEffects> could have committed the crime!
</line><line>Athena:
A-Are you sure you know where you're going with this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I might not be too sure, but I can't back down now!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright... I hope that I'm wrong, but this isn't one of your bluffs, by any chance...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha! Of course not! <textEffects>(...The judge knows me far too well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
And do you have a theory on where the actual scene of the crime was?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, of course! <textEffects>(Think, Phoenix! Think! Think of a place--other than the orca pool room--where one could fall to one's death!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Then, by all means, please share your theory with the court! <textEffects>Where was the real scene of the murder?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>show stage pool</textEffects> might have been drained of water at some point as well! And, if so, it would be just as possible to fall to one's death there as the orca pool!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Wright-dono. What you're doing is a disgrace to your profession. I sincerely hope you have some basis for what you're suggesting!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Of course I do! <textEffects>(I will... as soon as I think of something...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
The victim's body was found in the orca pool! How do you explain that?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
How about if, after the victim was killed in the show stage pool... ...his body was moved to the orca pool...?
</line><line>Judge:
"How about if..." What kind of presentation of your argument is that?! You had better have a reasonable explanation of how the body was moved! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's no turning back now! I have to think of a way the body could've been moved! Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?)</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>hoist</textEffects> runs between the orca pool room and the show stage. The stretcher can be hung from the hoist to move things like Orla or the skull rock. The stretcher could also have been used to move the dead body! 
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Yes, if the stretcher can move the orca or the skull rock... ...it seems likely it could also move a dead body as well.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow! Somehow, that worked! I just might be able to pull this off!)</textEffects> If the show pool was the scene of the crime, somebody else could have done it!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. You desperately spew conjecture and now you even make up a crime scene? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
Eeeeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>Athena:
Not again?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
You don't have the soul of a warrior. You don't deserve to be on the battlefield! And even your fabrication is half-baked. It's a disgrace! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean, "half-baked"?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The hoist can be operated <textEffects>from the orca pool room only</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gah... 
</line><line>Blackquill:
And the only person who entered the orca pool room was the defendant. So even if the body was moved... ...the only one who could have moved it was the defendant herself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
NAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order...! So it comes back to the defendant, no matter which pool it was?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Meaning... I can't clear Sasha either way...? Sasha said she moved Orla and the skull rock... ...and I believe her. So could it be possible that she moved the body herself without being aware of it?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright? Do you have an objection to Prosecutor Blackquill's claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have an objection to the claim that the defendant moved the body?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wh-What?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Are you admitting the defendant committed the murder?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...No. I'm simply conceding that she was the only one who could have moved the body. However, I contend Ms. Buckler was not aware that is what she was doing. The culprit made her move it, unbeknownst to her!
</line><line>Judge:
The defendant moved a dead body without recognizing that it was a dead body? How could that be possible?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The body was found in the orca pool. It must have been moved there somehow. I might find some kind of hint in the things she moved with the stretcher!)</textEffects> <textEffects>The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
The skull rock...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Buckler told me yesterday that she moved the skull rock when she was cleaning. The only two things Ms. Buckler moved to the orca pool are Orla and the skull rock. I would like to suggest that <textEffects>the victim's body</textEffects> may have been inside the skull rock!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hidden inside the rock, the body could have been moved to the orca pool with the hoist. At the show stage, Marlon Rimes loaded up the skull rock, with the body inside... ...and then he used the walkie-talkie to let Ms. Buckler know the rock was loaded. Ms. Buckler operated the hoist from the orca pool room and moved the stretcher! She moved the rock without knowing the body was inside!
</line><line>Judge:
Do you really think there's enough space inside the skull rock to place a body?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Swashbuckler flyer indicates it could be possible. Please focus on the question at the bottom left.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! It says, "Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!" Hmm. In that case, I suppose the rock is most likely hollow.

What's more, if the body was inside the skull rock... ...it explains the remaining <textEffects>unanswered questions</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Such as...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at the security footage of the scene Ms. DePlume witnessed. Where did the <textEffects>body</textEffects> that Ms. DePlume saw come from? Please recall... What was Orla doing to the <textEffects>skull rock</textEffects> at this time? She was head-butting it.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Orla's ramming released the body from the skull rock! The body had been placed inside the skull rock and moved there from the show stage. I assert that the real murder scene was, in fact, the show stage pool!

</line><line>Phoenix:
It's easy enough to verify what I say. Take a look inside the skull rock for yourself! You should find some kind of proof that the body was there. Blood, fibers, hair...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wright-dono...!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! Th-That was incredible! You turned things completely around! And to think! It all started with that half-baked bluff, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one! <textEffects>(Did you really have to add that last bit?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
If the murder took place at the show stage, then who is the perpetrator?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It is, naturally, the person who was at the show stage.
</line><line>Rimes:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes... Weren't you the one who loaded the skull rock onto the stretcher at the show stage?
</line><line>Rimes:
........................ ............Heh heh. Wow, Mr. Wright. That was some pretty smart brain work ya did there. To be honest, I never thought you could figure it out... I tried to protect myself, but I guess it came back to bite me...
</line><line>Judge:
Are you confessing you gave false testimony before, Mr. Rimes?! That's perjury!
</line><line>Rimes:
Yeah... What Mr. Wright says is true. The body WAS inside the skull rock. And it's true the captain was killed in the show pool, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What? He's admitting it that easily?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
This time, I'm gonna tell ya the whole truth about what happened that day!

<center><textEffects>-- The Whole Truth -- </textEffects></center>
<line>Rimes:
In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!
Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!
I can still remember the spectators' screams clearly...
All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So now we're back to the orca again, I see!
</line><line>Blackquill:
If you were going to give testimony like that, why did I bother putting you on the stand?
</line><line>Rimes:
All I'm doin' is tellin' the truth! That day, Sasha wanted to do the old version of the Swashbuckler Spectacular. So I suggested she hide the body in the skull rock and move it to the orca pool. I was gonna figure out what to do with the body after the show was over. The orca is the one that killed the captain! It wasn't me, and it wasn't Sasha!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So it was Mr. Rimes's idea to hide the body in the skull rock? But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit, why would he protect Sasha? False charges against Sasha would mean he himself would escape suspicion. So why...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright, how about if you leave this to me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena! Do you mean... you heard something?!
</line><line>Athena:
Yup, noise! Discord in Mr. Rimes's heart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So that means, somewhere in his testimony, there's an inconsistency in his emotions... All right, Athena! Give him a good counseling session!
</line><line>Athena:
You got it, Boss! Huh? What's this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you getting, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
...Hmm... This testimony is pretty complex. Feelings of deep <textEffects>sadness</textEffects> and intense <textEffects>anger</textEffects> are being called up. Those two emotions appear to be running <textEffects>out of control</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Out-of-control emotions...? Is that going to be a problem?
</line><line>Athena:
We'll have to probe their <textEffects>cause</textEffects> if we want to get to his true emotions and testimony. There might even be odd or unnatural spots in his testimony he isn't even aware of.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Let's <textEffects>probe</textEffects> the cause of his out-of-control emotions, then!
</line><line>Athena:
I'll explain how to probe. Let's find the root cause together. When you see something off in a statement, tap the <textEffects>Probe</textEffects> button! Next, point to what's causing Mr. Rimes's out-of-control emotions. Finally, tap <textEffects>Probe</textEffects> to complete the process! When emotions are out of control, <textEffects>memories can be recalled incorrectly</textEffects>. If you still haven't found anything after all the statements and images, I'll help.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Great! All right. I'll get started comparing the statements with the images.

It'd be hard to find them both at the same time. Let's concentrate on probing just one. He did make one odd statement I was wondering about... I highly doubt there were any <textEffects>spectators</textEffects> at the scene of the crime.

Okay. That made the <textEffects>sadness</textEffects> subside. So maybe the "<textEffects>spectators</textEffects>" part was what was making him sad?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wonder why he would make that mistake, saying <textEffects>spectators were there</textEffects>? How strange.
</line><line>Athena:
The only thing I can think of... is that he was <textEffects>mixing up</textEffects> one memory with another. Like... he was in a similar situation before, and it was deeply imprinted on his heart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A situation where an orca killed somebody and there were spectators there...? Hey! I think I know why he's mixing up his memories... The reason why Mr. Rimes mixed up his memories is...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, I think I know what happened. Could you have been mixing up <textEffects>what happened a year ago</textEffects> with this incident? Maybe that's why you slipped and said the owner was killed in front of spectators?
</line><line>Rimes:
What?! How did you...?! You're right... I did see the orca kill somebody a year ago... But what about it? I was just one of the spectators.
</line><line>Athena:

Stop this nonsensical scrutiny of feelings! Just present evidence to prove your point!
</line><line>Athena:
Eeep! B-Boss, do we have any kind of evidence that would back us up here?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm. There IS one piece that comes to mind that might explain his sadness...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Well?! I'm waiting! <textEffects>Let's see this "evidence" that has to do with Marlon Rimes's sadness!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Azura Summers died an accidental death one year ago. This is her boyfriend's charm.
</line><line>Rimes:
H-Hey...! What are ya doin' with that charm?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was found in Rifle's stomach yesterday. Judging by your reaction, I believe this charm belongs to you?
</line><line>Rimes:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess I need to push him just a little harder to make him admit it.
</line><line>Athena:
When Mr. Rimes said the word "charm," he was very rattled. We'd better examine this charm a little more.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good idea. Let's look inside it. ...Huh? What's this? A photograph...? H-Hey, this is... ...Azura Summers and Marlon Rimes!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Rimes, you and Azura Summers... were a couple, weren't you?
</line><line>Rimes:
Nghhh! So what if we were a couple?! It doesn't have anything to do with the captain's case!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You believe you saw the orca kill your girlfriend. That's the cause of your <textEffects>sadness</textEffects>. Isn't that emotion of yours connected to the current case? 
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
The only thing you revealed was the witness's relationship with the victim a year ago. What does the witness's past have to do with the case at hand?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know yet...
</line><line>Athena:
But we managed to pinpoint the source of his sadness! Now let's delve into who Mr. Rimes is angry at!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rimes:
<textEffects>In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Rimes:
<textEffects>Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
<textEffects>I can still remember the captain's dead body clearly...</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
<textEffects>All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
<textEffects>When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Athena:
Now that his out-of-control <textEffects>sadness</textEffects> has subsided, the situation is a little different. Let's think about why he was so intensely angry!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, you're <textEffects>angry</textEffects> with Orla, aren't you?
</line><line>Rimes:
Angry? At an orca? Why would I be? If ya think I have some reason to be mad, then show me some proof.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?)</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I bet that evidence we just took a look at would come in handy here.)</textEffects> This charm indicates that you were Azura Summers's boyfriend. I'm sure you believe Orla killed your girlfriend a year ago. You lost your girlfriend, and so you've been <textEffects>angry</textEffects> at Orla! 
</line><line>Rimes:
Ngh............ All right. I'll admit it. I'll never forgive that orca. Azura is dead, and that orca is still swimmin' around, happy as a clam. I became an animal keeper just so I could prove that orca is a killer. You're right! I want that orca to pay! There! Do ya feel good, draggin' up a person's past?! But it still doesn't change anythin'!
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>30%</b></center>

Phoenix:
Ack! <textEffects>(He's right...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I disagree. It DOES change things! His out-of-control emotion quieted down. Now we should be able to find out the truth behind that emotion!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rimes:
<textEffects>In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:

<textEffects>When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Athena:
According to my analysis, Mr. Rimes is usually a very calm person. Let's see if we can find any inconsistencies between his words and his emotions!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca finding the body, you "<textEffects>freaked</textEffects>"? Really?
</line><line>Rimes:
............ What are ya gettin' at?
</line><line>Phoenix:
With Ms. DePlume as a witness, Orla was guaranteed to be accused of the murder. Didn't it work out exactly as you'd hoped? In order to have Orla put down, you made sure Ms. DePlume witnessed that scene!

</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Even Prosecutor Blackquill is at a loss for words...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
So I planned to have that wench be a witness? Heh heh. Arr! Ye caught me out. It be true I thought that orca's murderous ways should be found out! That be why I schemed to have DePlume see the body!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you admit it? You deliberately framed Orla?!
</line><line>Rimes:
............Arr! It be true! But what skin be that off of anybody's nose? That orca be a murderin' scurvy dog! I may have a grudge against that orca, but I always felt grateful toward the cap'n. The orca murdered Azura and the cap'n, so o' course she should walk the plank!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gah! <textEffects>(I-I don't have a response to that...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I agree it wouldn't make any sense for him to kill the owner. Why would he? But his hatred for Orla on the other hand comes through loud and clear.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(............Wait a minute... If killing Mr. Shipley <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't make sense</textEffects>, who would it <textEffects>make sense</textEffects> for Rimes to kill?

Oh? And what is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now that we know about Mr. Rimes's intense hatred of Orla... ...it turns the premise we've been arguing under on its ear!)</textEffects> <textEffects>I will now reveal the identity of the individual Mr. Rimes meant to kill from the start!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the witness's intent was to kill the orca?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. The witness's intended victim was not Jack Shipley. From the start, it was all a scheme to kill Orla!
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca was his true target? But Jack Shipley is the one who died! The orca is alive and quite well!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(Hmm. He's right... He wanted to kill the orca, and yet it was Jack Shipley who fell to his death. How did that happen? ...Wait a minute...! What if...? What if Mr. Rimes wanting to kill Orla was somehow connected to Mr. Shipley's death?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Phoenix:
They aren't reckless words! The basis for my claim is at the real murder scene... the <textEffects>show pool</textEffects>!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's my contention that two incidents happened at the show pool. The <textEffects>attempted murder of the orca</textEffects>, and the <textEffects>victim falling to his death</textEffects>. First of all, in order to kill the orca, Mr. Rimes removed something from the scene. And, by so doing, he made it possible for Mr. Shipley to fall to his death.
</line><line>Judge:
What did he remove?
</line><line>Judge: <i>[sic]</i>
<textEffects>This is what Mr. Rimes removed in an attempt to kill Orla!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Blackquill:
Don't tell me you're trying to claim he tried to kill the orca by draining the pool water?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm claiming. To help the defendant with the cleaning, Marlon Rimes took charge of Orla... ...with the plan to kill Orla in the show pool! And because the pool water was drained... ...it made it possible for Jack Shipley to <textEffects>fall to his death</textEffects> in the show pool!

You claim you were looking after Orla in the early morning hours of July 20th... ...but I don't think you were doing a very good job of it. After all, Orla wasn't given anything to eat during that time.
</line><line>Rimes:
How would ye know such a thing?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know because of Orla's record here in the TORPEDO data system. This system continuously records data on the subjects it monitors. From Orla's record, we can tell exactly when she ate... or didn't eat.
</line><line>Rimes:
Sink me! Nobody ever told me 'bout that dastardly contraption!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Only a few of the Shipshape Aquarium staff know about this system. According to Orla's record, <textEffects>she never ate</textEffects> in those early morning hours of the 20th. You planned to kill Orla, and that's why you didn't feed her!

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ack, he's right. I don't have any proof...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
If Orla simply didn't eat, then that would create an inconsistency. Where did her <textEffects>fish</textEffects> go?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Her fish? Good question. Where did it disappear to?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Fish? What does it matter? What relevance does it have to the case? Cease this stalling by asking inconsequential questions! Stop delving into the depths of the orca's stomach and delve into the case instead!

</line><line>Phoenix:
But wait! It may seem like a small inconsistency... ...but it's an issue of great importance. <textEffects>(I think.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What are you driving at, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How could the fish disappear? Somebody must have eaten it... So who came to the show stage and ate Orla's fish? I think I might have a pretty good idea...)</textEffects> I believe there must have been a <textEffects>visitor</textEffects> to the show stage that Mr. Rimes didn't notice.
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Visitor? Are you trying to introduce yet another suspect at this eleventh hour? If you utter more of your careless remarks, Taka won't look favorably upon it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't plan to utter any "careless" remarks. <textEffects>(Whether my remarks will actually be related to the case or not, I don't yet know...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, Boss. If Taka comes this way, I'll fend him off! But do try to keep your remarks "careful"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Somehow, Orla's fish disappeared... Somebody must've visited the show stage, but who?)</textEffects> <textEffects>This was the visitor to the show stage!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I believe Rifle the penguin visited the show stage!
</line><line>Judge:
First an orca, now a penguin?
</line><line>Rimes:
Why would ye be sayin' such a thing, Mr. Lawyer? I didn't see Rifle durin' the wee early mornin' hours! Do ye have any proof Rifle visited the show stage? If ye be a lawyer of any salt, show me yer evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The bottom of Rifle's feet were pink for some reason... That fact is a clue that Rifle was indeed at the show stage. I have to present that piece of evidence that connects Rifle to the show stage!)</textEffects> Now to prove I'm a lawyer worth my salt! <textEffects>This is the proof that Rifle visited the show stage!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Oh, my! What a cute little sign. Look at all of those adorable stars!
</line><line>Phoenix:
These stars are actually <textEffects>starfish</textEffects>. Ms. Buckler painted this sign. In the early morning hours of the 20th, she left this sign at the show stage to dry. Mr. Rimes kept an eye on the sign for Ms. Buckler while the paint was drying.
</line><line>Rimes:
Aye, that be true! But what be yer point?
</line><line>Phoenix:
On this sign... ...is proof that Rifle visited the show stage.
</line><line>Judge:
Proof of the penguin's visit? I'm afraid I don't see it... <textEffects>Where is this proof that the penguin visited the show stage? Please point it out.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
A couple of the pink starfish are shaped a little differently from the others.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, you're right! They look almost like little leaves.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Rifle had <textEffects>pink paint</textEffects> on the bottom of her feet. These little leaf-like shapes on this sign are actually <textEffects>Rifle's footprints</textEffects>. Rifle made these footprints by walking on the sign before it was dry!
</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho! What cute little penguin prints!
</line><line>Blackquill:
So there are footprints... What of them?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes was watching over this sign at the show stage while the paint dried. And during that time, the penguin paid a visit. According to the TORPEDO data system... ...we know that Rifle ate something that morning of the 20th. Most likely, Rifle ate <textEffects>the fish meant for Orla</textEffects> that was at the show stage. Orla's snack was a small quantity of fish. Even a penguin could have eaten it all.
</line><line>Rimes:
Begad! Rifle ate Orla's fish...? Who be ye to say Rifle ate Orla's fish? She could have picked up food anywhere! But that doesn't change the fact that I really WAS at the show stage. After all, I had to help move the skull rock. It couldn't have been moved without me!
</line><line>Blackquill:
The witness claims he never saw the penguin. How do you explain this contradiction?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Both Mr. Rimes and Rifle were at the show stage, but Mr. Rimes didn't see her. So <span style="color:#E16935">where</textEffects> could Mr. Rimes have been at the time?)</span>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wright-dono, if you aren't up to the task... ...I could disprove this witness's testimony for you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I leave it to Prosecutor Blackquill, Sasha will be declared guilty. I can't let him interrupt this line of reasoning!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! Let's try to figure out how things looked when Rifle came to the show stage.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes was at the show stage, keeping an eye on Orla and the sign.
</line><line>Athena:
And we know it must be true, because he helped move the skull rock.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And then Rifle came in and walked over the sign...
</line><line>Athena:
But wouldn't Mr. Rimes notice Rifle if he was right there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, let's think about where Mr. Rimes could have been... <textEffects>Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
What?! Inside the pool? But, you're right. If he was inside the pool, he wouldn't have noticed Rifle. So are you saying Mr. Rimes was underwater the whole time Rifle was eating?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, not underwater. <textEffects>(When I think about what he was trying to do, the answer is clear. Now I'm finally starting to get the whole picture!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Just like yesterday... Must you two always be whispering to each other? Why don't you admit that resorting to a penguin will get you nowhere!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know about that. The fact that Mr. Rimes didn't notice Rifle is such a small inconsistency... ...but it's a key point that proves what Mr. Rimes was trying to do.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The penguin is a "key point"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The show stage pool is very deep. If Rifle came to visit while Mr. Rimes was at the <textEffects>bottom of this pool</textEffects>... ...he would have never noticed Rifle!
</line><line>Rimes:
...Arrrrr!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Orcas can be out of the water for a short time without sustaining damage. But if they're out of the water for a long time, they weaken and eventually die. In order to kill Orla, Mr. Rimes had to drain the pool. And while the pool was drained of water, Mr. Shipley fell to his death. The show stage pool is about 65 feet deep, just like the orca pool. Without water in the pool, a person could be made to <textEffects>fall 65 feet</textEffects>.
</line><line>Blackquill:
............!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes probably wondered what to do. If he continued with his plan to kill Orla, how would he dispose of Mr. Shipley's body? So he devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone.
</line><line>Judge:
What? How...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes went down to the bottom of the pool and put the victim's body in the rock. He then had Ms. Buckler move the rock and the body together.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
And the witness made the defendant do this somehow without arousing her suspicion?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Mr. Shipley told Ms. Buckler that she couldn't perform in the new show. Ms. Buckler became upset, and wanted to switch back to the old version of the show. So Mr. Rimes conveniently suggested that she take and hide a <textEffects>prop for the new show</textEffects>. Mr. Rimes then manipulated Orla, using her <textEffects>singing</textEffects> and <textEffects>lifesaver</textEffects> tricks. He schemed to have Orla find the body while Ms. DePlume would be standing witness. He saddled Orla with the false charge of murder so that Orla would be <textEffects>put down</textEffects>!
</line><line>Blackquill:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Rimes:
Arrrrr............! Raaaaarrr! GRAAAAAAAAARRR!
</line><line>Judge:
So the fact that the witness didn't see the penguin...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Shows that when Rifle visited the show stage, Rimes was putting the body in the rock. At the bottom of the pool, that is.
</line><line>Judge:
Who would have thought the presence of a penguin could prove the witness's actions!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's working! Just a little further now and Sasha will be proven not guilty!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
If you think you've won this battle, you are sorely mistaken. Your theory is based on the notion that the witness could <textEffects>manipulate the orca</textEffects>. Witness, can you control the orca's actions?
</line><line>Rimes:
............! Of course not. What kind of bilge be that? I be but a simple animal keeper!
</line><line>Judge:
If my memory serves... ...wasn't Ms. Buckler the only one who could issue commands to the orca?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............Ugh...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. The judge's blade is sharper than the lawyer's. If you wish to do battle with a witness, you'll need a honed blade. Where is your sword of evidence that <textEffects>Marlon Rimes could manipulate the orca</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! <textEffects>(Rimes had to have manipulated Orla in order for his plan to work. But how can I prove it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it appears this line of reasoning has become unsustainable...

</line><line>Judge:

</line><line>Phoenix:
A-Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
I've analyzed the hearts of all kinds of people. I have enough experience to see when I look into your heart that you haven't given up. So that objection was my way of speaking up for your heart!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............! <textEffects>(She's right. Why would I become a lawyer again, only to give up? I have to keep fighting!)</textEffects> Athena, thank you. With your help, I've remembered the old "Wright way."
</line><line>Athena:
The "Wright way"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! I'm not finished with presenting my argument!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Do you have anything else to ask this witness?
</line><line>Blackquill:
You've cross-examined all the witnesses and presented all your evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
All the witness...? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't cross-examined the most important one, the central figure in both cases.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The central figure...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The one involved in not only the case a year ago, but this current case, too... I've never called her as a witness, but it's time to do so now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Who are you talking about? I demand you tell the court immediately! <textEffects>Who is this "central figure" in both cases?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense calls the central figure in both cases... <textEffects>Orla the orca</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You intend to cross-examine an orca?!
</line><line>Rimes:
Arr! Cross-examine an orca? Ye must be addled! It be impossible, says I!

This absurdity is beyond the pale. How do you expect to question an orca, a creature incapable of speech?!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Orla is intricately involved in this case. I have every right to cross-examine her! Besides, even if she can't speak, I think cross-examining her will be invaluable!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Very well! Do what you will, then! But if you fail to garner anything from this little exercise with the orca... ...I hope you realize the reward for your efforts will be the defendant's guilty verdict!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............I'm ready and confident.
</line><line>Athena:
So... Cross-examining Orla, huh? That was a bold move, Boss. Now all we have to do is figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Now it's Orla's turn to help us save Sasha!
</line><line>Judge:
An orca defendant yesterday, an orca witness today! This is truly unprecedented. But even though this is highly unusual, I'm prepared to allow it. Bailiff! Ready the witness telecast! We'll have a ten-minute recess while the telecast is being set up.

Athena:
Leave it to you to think of something like calling Orla, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, she's the only one who knows all the answers, after all. I just talked to Pearls, and she said Orla seems to be feeling fine. Now we have to try and figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla.
</line><line>Athena:
If we put Mr. Rimes and Orla together, maybe we can get some kind of clue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And I can't forget about that strange <span style="color:#E16935">set of prints</textEffects> of Rimes's, either...)</span>
</line><line>Buckler:
I r-EEL-y appreciate your trying to save both Orla and me. I had no idea Marlon hated Orla like that... I feel like I've been shocked by a torpedo ray.
</line><line>DePlume:
Of course he would hate the killer whale that murdered his girlfriend right in front of him!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! Ms. DePlume! You've been watching the trial?
</line><line>DePlume:
Oh, yes! I came to make a declaration of war!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A d-declaration of war...?
</line><line>DePlume:
No matter what the results of today's trial, I will report the truth in my new book. Even if that truth goes against what I wrote in "The Killer Killer Whale."
</line><line>Crab:
I don't know what the truth is... Not even about what happened a year ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Dr. Crab...
</line><line>Crab:
Azura died right in front of my eyes, in the middle of a pirate show... She suddenly fell from the orca's back and began to thrash around in pain. The orca was singing a song, and then started head-butting Azura over and over. Finally, the orca took Azura in her mouth and brought her to the side of the pool. Just before she died, Azura was holding her chest, in obvious pain...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...She was holding her chest...? Wait a minute... Could it be...?)</textEffects> ...I don't think Orla was to blame for the incident a year ago, either.
</line><line>Crab:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think the cause of Ms. Summers's death might have been... ...her <textEffects>heart condition</textEffects>.
</line><line>Crab:
Heart condition? What heart condition?! I never heard anything about it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Summers had a prescription with Hickfield Clinic for a heart condition. The orca didn't kill her. I think it's possible her heart condition did!
</line><line>Buckler:
What?! Azura had a heart condition, too?! I guess she hid it from everybody, just like I did...
</line><line>Crab:
............! So that means... ...the orca was innocent a year ago, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's just a theory, but... I think the orca head-butted Azura to check on her... ...and then did the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects> to rescue her.
</line><line>Crab:
............So there was no need to put the orca down after all...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... you really did intend to put Orla down...?
</line><line>Crab:
...No. Jack and I... ...were against such a thing from the start.
</line><line>Athena:
B-But you said you were going to "euthanize the orca"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah... I've been wondering about that...)</textEffects> Dr. Crab... About this capsule... It's not a poison, but a <textEffects>sleeping drug</textEffects>, right...?
</line><line>Crab:
That's right. Even if Orla attacks someone... ...or even if the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demands she be put down... ...I never had any intention of killing her. I would use sleeping pills to make it look like she was dead, and then set her free. That's why I purchased so many sleeping capsules.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! THAT'S why?
</line><line>DePlume:
............! I never considered the possibility that that poor woman's death was illness...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She seems pretty disturbed to be wrong...)</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
............I simply want to know the truth. That is why I will tell you who my client is. The day I witnessed the owner's death, I was there at the request of the animal keeper.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes...?
</line><line>DePlume:
That is correct. That day, my client called me to ask me to investigate the orca pool.
</line><line>Athena:
H-he must have wanted you to witness what Orla was going to do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Why did you decide to tell us this?
</line><line>DePlume:
My desire to protect my client was standing in the way of the truth. I couldn't allow that. I will be watching to see how this all unfolds. Good luck to you, blue and yellow duo.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, that was quite a bombshell she just dropped, and so casually, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That woman really is a free spirit.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
Do you remember what you said yesterday, Mr. Lawyer? That you'd expose any secret if it would help save Sasha?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I remember. It's my duty as a lawyer.
</line><line>Crab:
Well, I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you for exposing the <textEffects>aquarium's secret</textEffects>. It may put me in hot water, but if it helps save the orca... Let me clue you in on another secret. Focus on the <textEffects>orca's song</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The orca's song, huh...? <textEffects>(What could he be hinting at?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Looks like it's time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Let's go back in.

You've got it, Boss! We're gonna go in there and save Sasha and Orla--together!

</line><line>Pearl:
Of course, Mr. Nick. What is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're using Mr. Rimes's TV phone, correct? I'd like you to examine it for me. Please look for videos of Azura Summers issuing whistle commands to Orla.
</line><line>Pearl:
Um... videos...? I'm not too sure how to do that, but I'll give it a try... My apologies to Marlon...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wright-dono... what are you up to?
</line><line>Phoenix:

Mr. Nick! I found them! I found some videos like you described. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
You did? Thank you, Ms. Fey! <textEffects>(Just as I suspected!)</textEffects> How did Marlon Rimes get Orla to do those tricks? I will now show you... ...with Mr. Rimes's <textEffects>cell phone</textEffects>! 
</line><line>Blackquill:
His cell phone?! Are you implying he used an app?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Fey, see if you can issue Orla a command.
</line><line>Pearl:
Me? Can I do such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You might be able to, if you play a video with a whistle signal in it. If there's a video of the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects>, please play that. Before you do, though, please put the practice dummy in the pool.
</line><line>Pearl:
The practice dummy? All right... In it goes! ...There. It sank to the bottom. Now I'll play a video.
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet! 
</line><line>Pearl:
Orla is diving down, heading straight for the dummy!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwe fweet!
</line><line>Pearl:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Ms. Fey. You were a big help. <textEffects>(Now I have proof!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... Unbelievable! You actually pulled it off...
</line><line>Judge:
That was... the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects> we saw yesterday! Is Ms. Fey an orca trainer now?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'll explain after we try one more trick. Now let's see if we can command Orla to do the singing trick. ...Ms. Fey. If there's a video of the singing trick, please play that. 
</line><line>Pearl:
Certainly! ...Let's see. Is it this video? 
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fwe fweet!

</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho. What a lovely singing voice!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ It wasn't bad.
</line><line>Judge:
By the way, how did Ms. Fey give the orca those commands?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes has something on his phone that his girlfriend, Azura Summers, sent him. They're videos of Ms. Summers issuing commands to Orla with a whistle. If they have Orla listen to the sounds of the signals, anyone at all could command Orla! 
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! Anyone at all?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. All they would have to do is play those videos. 
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please submit those videos as evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm getting the sneaking suspicion the judge just wants to try it out for himself...)</textEffects> Ms. Fey, could you send those videos to the TV phone here?

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ I have to commend you. That was very good proof. I concede Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the orca. But isn't it true that the defendant could have done it as well? All she would have to do is use the whistle, the whistle she knows how to use so well. And she wouldn't have had to use those videos... Surely you admit it's a possibility? She could have easily had Norma DePlume witness the singing and the lifesaver trick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So he's trying to argue it was equally possible for Sasha as it was for Rimes, is he? But is that true? Let me think about that for a minute...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>DePlume:
That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was <textEffects>singing</textEffects>! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the <textEffects>Swashbuckler Spectacular song</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The culprit made sure Ms. DePlume heard the <span style="color:#E16935">song</textEffects> and saw the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects>. Could Sasha have shown these two tricks to the witness?)</span> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Don't you worry... My sword is drawn and ready! My sword is... evidence that the two tricks <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't have been shown at the same time</textEffects>!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time. However, that fact is inconsistent with <textEffects>how Orla performs tricks</textEffects>.
</line><line>Blackquill:
How Orla performs tricks? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Orla can't perform two tricks at once. She performs only <textEffects>one trick per whistle signal</textEffects>. That's how she's been trained.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. In other words, it would be just like, with a dog... ...if you tell him to both "sit" and "shake," he won't do them at the same time. Am I understanding it correctly?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, that's the idea, Your Honor. <textEffects>(I wonder if the judge has a dog?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a farce! So are you saying that the witness somehow managed to produce an impossible scenario? 
</line><line>Rimes:
Arr! If the creature's own trainer couldn't do it, how could I?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Yes, it's a mystery, isn't it?
</line><line>Athena: 
B-Boss, you don't have to agree so cheerfully... 
</line><line>Blackquill:
The defense is claiming that Marlon Rimes manipulated the orca... ...but if you cannot explain fully how this was done, your argument doesn't hold water! If you can't straighten out your own theory, would you like me to straighten you out?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... no, thank you! 
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm. So Orla can't do two tricks at a time, but Ms. DePlume saw her do it... This logical inconsistency means there's a flaw somewhere. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Was Ms. DePlume lying...? Or is it not true that Orla can't do two tricks at a time..?
</line><line>Athena:
But Ms. DePlume had no reason to lie about such a thing. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
If it really is impossible for Orla to perform two tricks at once... ...then maybe either the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects> or the <textEffects>singing trick</textEffects> was... faked?
</line><line>Blackquill:
"Faked"...? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Maybe Orla only performed one of the tricks... ...but it was made to look like she performed two! 
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
"Maybe"?! How do you expect to conduct a sword battle with conjecture?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sounds like I'd better present some evidence here, and fast.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Although I am concerned about your profuse sweating, Mr. Wright, allow me to ask you... <textEffects>Which of the two was faked, the <span style="color:#E16935">lifesaver trick</textEffects>, or the <textEffects>singing trick</textEffects>?</span> 
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is a recording of a <textEffects>recent Swashbuckler Spectacular</textEffects>. In this recording, Orla sings the same song she sang for Ms. Fey earlier. But Ms. DePlume said this song is <textEffects>different from the one sang a year ago</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
The song is different...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please listen to the <textEffects>song in the video from a year ago</textEffects>, sent to this cell phone.
</line><line>Orla:
Fwe fweet! Fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet!
Fweet! Fweet! Fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, yes. It sounds quite different from the song Orla sang for Ms. Fey earlier.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And yet, this is the same video Ms. Fey used to issue the command to Orla to sing. By having Ms. DePlume listen to the song recorded in the cell phone video... ...the true culprit made Ms. DePlume think Orla was <textEffects>singing the song from a year ago</textEffects>! Only Marlon Rimes, the owner of the cell phone videos, could have done this!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
But Ms. DePlume said she <textEffects>heard the orca singing right in front of her</textEffects>! How do you claim he made her think that? How was the song recording played?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I intend to explain that, too, of course.
</line><line>Blackquill:
What...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The answer lies somewhere in the orca pool visitor's corridor. <textEffects>Marlon Rimes played the song recording by using this!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume heard the song while she was in the orca pool visitor's corridor. There's a <textEffects>speaker</textEffects> in that corridor, so that visitors can hear the orca's sounds.
</line><line>Blackquill:
And you claim the song was played from that speaker? How?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Here's how Rimes played the song over the speaker in the visitor's corridor!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes could broadcast the song in the video to the speaker by using a walkie-talkie! And he could get Orla to do a trick by letting her hear Ms. Summers's whistle signal, too. He played the <textEffects>singing</textEffects> through the speaker, and he made Orla do the <textEffects>lifesaver trick</textEffects>. All of this was the doing of the true culprit--Marlon Rimes!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is what you did, isn't it... Mr. Rimes?!
</line><line>Rimes:
Ngh............ ARRRRRRRRRRRRR!
</line><line>Athena:
You did it! Now we can save both Sasha and Orla! Just leave it to Cap'n Wright's Swashbucklin' Lawyers to win any case!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Judge:
So it actually WAS possible for Mr. Rimes to manipulate the orca! I'm stunned. I see we will need to hear more from this witness...

</line><line>Judge:
Tooth marks? Ah, yes. I see them.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim's walkie-talkie... ...was a keepsake that used to belong to Azura Summers, who died a year ago. These tooth marks were left by Orla when she carried Ms. Summers in her mouth. 
</line><line>Rimes:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. If this is Mr. Shipley's walkie-talkie... ...then Mr. Rimes's walkie-talkie is still unaccounted for! Which means he could have used it to command the orca after all!

And that's not all, Your Honor. The only one who could have taken the victim's walkie-talkie is the <textEffects>culprit</textEffects> himself!

</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright, I found something interesting. The tooth marks on the walkie-talkie... Notice anything funny about them?

Something is different about them, compared to the other tooth marks we've seen.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm. The only other ones I remember are the ones on the practice dummy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
It's just a tiny difference. It might not even mean anything...

<line>Phoenix:
Time to review the facts we have so far. With the intent of killing Orla, Rimes drained the show stage pool. But Rimes failed to kill Orla, and, instead, he tried to pin Shipley's murder on Orla. In order to manipulate Orla, Rimes must have used a <textEffects>cell phone</textEffects> and a <textEffects>walkie-talkie</textEffects>. But the walkie-talkie Rimes has is broken. I think it's the victim's walkie-talkie, the one he kept as a memento of Azura Summers.

A year ago, the orca's <textEffects>song</textEffects> and <textEffects>teeth marks</textEffects> were different from what they are now. What could be the cause of these <textEffects>two inconsistencies</textEffects>? <textEffects>What's behind the fact that the orca's <span style="color:#E16935">tooth marks</textEffects> and <textEffects>song</textEffects> were different from a year ago?</span>
</line>



<center><b>THERE ARE 2 DIFFERENT ORCAS</b></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
I'm beginning to think... there are two different orcas: the one a year ago, and Orla now. And if the orca a year ago wasn't Orla... ...it means the bite mark on the walkie-talkie isn't Orla's, like Rimes said it was. Now I can finally prove the walkie-talkie belongs to the victim!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, you appear to be lost in thought there. Is everything all right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I just realized something... astonishing, Your Honor... 
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Your face is what's astonishing, Wright-dono.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Your rudeness is what's astonishing Prosecutor Blackquill...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
And what is this astonishing thing you realized?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Until just now, I thought the <textEffects>orca at Shipshape Aquarium a year ago</textEffects>, and <textEffects>Orla</textEffects>... ...were <textEffects>the same orca</textEffects>. However, two inconsistencies led me to a new fact. And that fact is... that there might be two Ora Shipleys! 
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Two different orcas?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
B-But that's impossible! 
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Explain yourself! What is the basis for this preposterous claim?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
The orca's show song a year ago and the one now are different. I believe it's because the orca a year ago was a <textEffects>different orca</textEffects>. Two different orcas; two different songs. It explains the show song contradiction!
</line><line>Rimes:
Wh-What be this bilge-water talk?! I don't understand! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm talking about the truth--truth that will finally catch you out in your lies. You claimed that the tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were Orla's but that's not true. The <textEffects>two different bite mark patterns</textEffects> on the walkie-talkie and on the dummy proves this.
</line><line>Rimes:
What?! Two different patterns, ye say...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
...While I will concede there is a possibility that two different orcas exist... ...bite mark patterns alone are not proof enough. I want more conclusive evidence! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
...All right. I will show you conclusive evidence, then. <textEffects>(So he wants to see evidence <span style="color:#E16935">other than the bite mark patterns</textEffects>, does he? The orca a year ago and Orla have different <textEffects>songs</textEffects> and different <textEffects>teeth</textEffects>. Don't I have <textEffects>two videos</textEffects> on hand that can be used to compare those differences...?)</span> <textEffects>I will now submit two videos with which the different <span style="color:#E16935">songs</textEffects> and <textEffects>teeth</textEffects> can be compared!</span> 
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Phoenix:
Please compare these two videos, one from a year ago, and one recent. As discussed, the two orcas are singing <textEffects>two different songs</textEffects>. Please also pay special attention to the appearance of the two orcas' <textEffects>teeth</textEffects>! 
</line><line>Judge:
How exactly do you claim their teeth are different? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's look for shots in the two videos where <textEffects>the orcas' teeth</textEffects> are shown. This is Orla in the recent video of the Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show. As you can see, she has <textEffects>all of her teeth</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
What a healthy smile she has! I'm a bit envious.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Next, let's take a look at the TV phone video from a year ago. <textEffects>(Just as I thought! Their <span style="color:#E16935">teeth are different</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! I believe this smile looks a little different from the one we saw a moment ago. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see, the orca from a year ago has <textEffects>one tooth that's broken off</textEffects>.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Ngh............ If the teeth are different, then...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. If the teeth are different, they of course leave different bite mark patterns! On the practice dummy, you can see Orla's <textEffects>uniform pattern, with all teeth intact</textEffects>. And on the walkie-talkie, you can see that <textEffects>one tooth is missing from the pattern</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, I see it! Just like the smile of the orca in last year's video!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were not made by the orca we know as Orla! They were made a year ago by a different orca! 
</line><line>Rimes:
T-Two different orcas...? I-I can't believe it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The statement that the tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were from Orla was a lie. The truth is... this walkie-talkie was stolen from the victim, Jack Shipley! And the only person who could have stolen it is... the true culprit, Marlon Rimes!
</line><line>Rimes:
No... Ye got it all wrong............ It be all............ the fault of that orca... Woah............ Huh............? Arr............! Ye got it all wrong! Blimey! It be the orca's fault! This can't be............ ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
</line>
<center>Once again............ I'm too weak............ ...to help anybody............ </center>
<line>
Judge:
Well... it would appear... ...we should hear more from the defendant about Ora Shipley. ...Sasha Buckler.
</line><line>Buckler:
Y-Yes, Cap'n Judge?!
</line><line>Judge:
Is what Mr. Wright claims true? Are there two different orcas?
</line><line>Buckler:
I............ I, uh............
</line><line>Phoenix:
The secret that Shipshape Aquarium was hiding was about Orla, wasn't it? Dr. Crab told me to focus on the <textEffects>orca's song</textEffects>. He hinted it would be a clue.
</line><line>Buckler:
............Phoenix is right. The one we call "Orla" is <textEffects>the second</textEffects> "Ora Shipley." There actually used to be two orcas at Shipshape Aquarium. I used to call the first Ora Shipley just "<textEffects>Ora</textEffects>" for short. Ora and Orla are sisters. The captain rescued them both when they got beached on the shore. But Orla was in bad shape, and the ship's doctor had to look after her for a long time. Both orcas loved the captain, so we decided to keep them on at Shipshape Aquarium.
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Why didn't you say anything about there being two orcas?
</line><line>Buckler:
Well, because... ...after the accident a year ago, Ora was <textEffects>put down</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Ora is dead?
</line><line>Buckler:
Yeah, the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demanded it... Apparently, the captain and the ship's doctor begged them... ..."We put the first one down, so please leave the second one alone," they said. Anyway, after the accident a year ago... ...the captain told us he was gonna put Orla in the pirate show as "Ora Shipley." He asked us to keep quiet about Ora's death until the time was right.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... What a surprising and complex tale... Did all Shipshape Aquarium employees know about this?
</line><line>Buckler:
No, just a select few of us.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Rimes, did you know about it?
</line><line>Rimes:
Of course not... How would I...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Tell me, Mr. Rimes. Did you plan on killing Orla from the start?
</line><line>Rimes:
...Yeah. I planned to do it durin' the cleanin', so I drained the pool. I figured if I didn't do somethin' about that beast, Sasha's life was in danger... Sasha trusted that orca... just as much as Azura did... I wanted to protect her! I couldn't help Azura... so I felt like protectin' Sasha was the least I could do... My duty... I built up my strength so I'd be ready to kill the orca. I even fought with sharks! But the captain realized my plan, and tried to save the orca...!
</line><line>Blackquill:
And that is why...you killed Jack Shipley? Ah... Now the report from the crime lab finally makes sense...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Report from the crime lab?
</line><line>Blackquill:
In court yesterday, you will recall I showed a photo of the victim lying on his back? According to the lab, the bruise on the victim's right wrist was Rimes's handprint.
</line><line>Phoenix:
His... <textEffects>handprint</textEffects>?
</line><line>Blackquill:
I didn't know how it fit in the case until I heard Rimes's story just now. But now we can imagine the reason for it being there. Rimes must have made the handprint when he fought with the victim over the orca.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A handprint made during a struggle...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rimes:
...I don't care what happens to me anymore. I deserve the death penalty. I'm the one that killed the captain. Please give Sasha her "not guilty" verdict.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Heh. You accept your defeat well, I see. Let me be your guide... to hell. Get on with the verdict, Your Baldness.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. It seems this unprecedented trial that began with an orca as the defendant... ...has finally come to a close.
</line><line>Athena:
Sasha is saved! Orla is going to be so happy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sasha's "not guilty" verdict is coming... Why do I still have this nagging feeling? Rimes's handprint on the victim's right wrist... Was it really the result of a deadly struggle over the orca? I can't shake the feeling... that handprint has some other, hidden meaning... Is this trial going to end without revealing the whole truth...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, please hold off on that verdict!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would like to further explore this <textEffects>new evidence</textEffects> the prosecution just submitted!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...But what complaint could you have? You are about to get your "not guilty" verdict!
</line><line>Judge:
I see no need to further prolong this trial, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, we still don't know the <textEffects>entire truth</textEffects> of this case! This <textEffects>unnatural handprint</textEffects> Mr. Rimes left on the victim's right wrist... ...I don't think it was a result of a fight between the two men.
</line><line>Judge:
Not the result of a fight?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Then what do you suggest it was?
</line><line>Athena:
Boss! What are you doing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you remember that evidence we found at the show stage?
</line><line>Athena:
Evidence? What evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That <textEffects>mysterious mark</textEffects> might be the key to understanding the whole case. Your Honor! The defense would like to submit evidence that will expose the truth of this case! <textEffects>A <span style="color:#E16935">mysterious piece of evidence</textEffects> that pairs with Mr. Rimes's <textEffects>unnatural handprint</textEffects>!</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes left behind a <textEffects>very unusual set of fingerprints</textEffects> at the show stage.
</line><line>Judge:
In what way were they unusual?
</line><line>Phoenix:
They were <textEffects>right-hand prints</textEffects> on the <textEffects>left side</textEffects> of the ladder. If one were to grasp the ladder in the same way as the prints, it would look like this.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. It looks like the ladder is being grasped from above.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. And the handprint on the victim's right wrist shows it was held by a powerful grip. Marlon Rimes grasped the show stage ladder in an unnatural pose. If he was gripping the victim's wrist in this position...
</line><line>Judge:
Gripping the victim's wrist...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Th-Then he must have been...!
</line><line>Athena:
...It means Mr. Rimes was actually...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's right. If we couple the unnatural handprint with the mysterious fingerprints... ...we see that Marlon Rimes was trying to save the victim's life!
</line><line>Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
B-But that can't be...! It's... impossible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why don't we ask Mr. Rimes himself?
</line><line>Rimes:
Yeah............ I............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, we want to hear the truth directly from you.
</line><line>Rimes:
Heh... I gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Lawyer... You got skills... Why...? Why did ya have to figure it out? It doesn't matter what happens to me anymore... I'm ready to die...
</line><line>Judge:
So is what the defense is claiming... true?
</line><line>Rimes:
The captain... He found out I drained the show stage pool... He rushed to the side of the pool, frantic to put some water in for the orca. And then... he slipped...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rimes:
Captain! Gimme your left hand!
</line><line>Shipley:
No, Marlon! You'll fall, too! Forgive me, Marlon... I didn't realize what deep pain you were in... But, please... Please don't blame Orla. It's nobody's fault... Not Orla's... and not yours............
</line><line>Rimes:
Hey............!
</line>
<center>Captaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain!</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So............ Jack Shipley's death was <textEffects>accidental</textEffects>... Why didn't you tell us that you didn't kill the victim?
</line><line>Rimes:
Because... I have no right to live anymore. I'm ready to get the death penalty... The captain died because of me! And then, on top of it all, I used his body to frame Orla... I was gonna kill Orla, and she wasn't even to blame. She didn't do anything wrong... The only thing I can do now... is pay for it all with my life... I can't do anythin'... ...I couldn't save the captain... I couldn't avenge Azura's death...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Mr. Rimes, you have the wrong idea about Ms. Summers' death. Not even the first Ora Shipley was responsible for her dying. Ora--of her own accord--was trying to save Ms. Summers's life.
</line><line>Rimes:
What............? What are you talkin' about...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Azura Summers suffered from a heart condition. But she didn't tell anyone, and she performed in the pirate show anyway. She had a heart attack and died before anyone could save her. I'm sure she didn't think Ora attacked her. There's nothing to "avenge."
</line><line>Rimes:
No way... A heart condition...? She never said a word about it!
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe she didn't want you to worry about her...
</line><line>Rimes:
So I wanted to get revenge all this time... for nothin'...!
</line><line>Judge:
So neither case was murder--not a year ago, and not this time, either. ...Your responsibility in this matter is great, but I believe you can be rehabilitated...
</line><line>Rimes:
............
</line><line>Buckler:
Marlon, you better come back to Shipshape Aquarium when you're done, ya hear? Orla and I and everybody will be waiting for you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You still have a lot to offer, Mr. Rimes. Live your life and never give up... for the sake of those who are gone, as well!
</line><line>Rimes:
I... I promise to make up for what I've done... even if it takes me my whole life! Mr. Wright... Sasha...
</line>
<center>Thank you!</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well! I have seen countless trials, but never one that ended like this. I don't know how, Mr. Wright, but you always seem to manage to turn things around. ...I think all this excitement has taken a few years off of my life...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that praise... or a diss...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then! This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>

Pearl:
Congratulations on your win!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you for all your help today, Pearls.
</line><line>Pearl:
Hee hee. All I did was have fun with Orla!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet! Fweet fweet!
</line><line>Buckler:
Orla, I'm back! Oh, I missed you, girl!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, I'm so happy for you and Orla, Sasha! Everything turned out great!
</line><line>Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! I r-EEL-y want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart! Orla and I are both r-EEL-y grateful! I will now act out me gratitude with a li'l performance! Arr!
</line><line>Crab:
Miss Orca Lover! Don't you think you'd better take care of your health first?!
</line><line>Buckler:
A-all right, fine... I promise. No more shows until I'm better. I don't want anybody to worry about me, after all!
</line><line>Crab:
Good! I'm glad that's settled. ...Hey, buddy. Mr. Lawyer... You just had to blab every single one of the aquarium's secrets, didn't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Dr. Crab.
</line><line>Crab:
Nah, that's all right. I'm glad.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It was kind of hard to tell...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
Although, thanks to you, they now know we're using the illegal TORPEDO system... ...but I think we'll be able to wiggle out of serious repercussions somehow. That writer lady is advocating for us, saying the law itself is to blame. She said she's going to look into getting the law changed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wow. Go, Ms. DePlume. <textEffects>(She sure is a powerhouse.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
There's one thing you didn't figure out, by the way. Keep this to yourself, will you? We don't want it getting out publicly. Remember that appointment I had written down in my calendar?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, you mean, "<textEffects>Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 am</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Crab:
That note meant the orca pool of the <textEffects>Supermarine Aquarium</textEffects>, not Shipshape's.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? Why were you supposed to meet there?
</line><line>Crab:
Jack and I... ...We visited the <textEffects>Supermarine Aquarium</textEffects> once a month. Any idea why?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, to get dolphin therapy treatment...?
</line><line>Crab:
No, silly! Remember I told you? Jack and I were against putting the orca down from the start.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! You mean...?!
</line><line>Crab:
We just pretended to put the first Ora Shipley down. The <textEffects>Supermarine Aquarium</textEffects> is harboring her for us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Oh! So that talk about large amounts of money you were paying them...
</line>
<hr />
<line>DePlume:
Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Crab:
We were paying for Ora's care. You wouldn't believe how much fish orcas eat! Now that it's been proven she was innocent all along, I think we can bring her back soon. Until then, keep it under you hat, okay?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? What was he telling you about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, nothing much.
</line><line>Athena:
By the way... Orla wants you to give her a little <textEffects>celebratory prize</textEffects>!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet! Fweet... fweet!
</line><line>Buckler:
Orla specifically requested that you give it to her, Phoenix!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. All right. Fine. <textEffects>(Let's see... What can I give her?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Orla, it's coming a day late... but congratulations on your verdict!
</line><line><i>Anime cutscene</i>
Orla:
*Fweet fweet!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
</line>
<hr /> 
<line>Pearl:
Oh, my! Hee hee! Aren't you lucky!
</line><line>Buckler:
Ha ha! That's Orla's best trick! The "<textEffects>thank-you kiss</textEffects>" trick!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet! Fweet!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Orla! I want to be next!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
And so the curtain fell on my first trial in years... I'm looking forward to the comeback of Sasha and Orla's Swashbuckler Spectacular. After all, I made a comeback of my own... as a lawyer.

Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's been a while since I visited Shipshape Aquarium. Now that Sasha has recovered from her illness, she's performing today. There's still some time before the show starts... Think I'll wander around a bit.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Buckler:
Hi, Phoenix! Hope you enjoy the show today! The orcas are excited and ready to go! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure I'll enjoy-- Wait a minute... Did you say "<textEffects>orcas</textEffects>," as in, plural?
</line><line>Buckler:
Yup! Let me show you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Two Orlas? Don't tell me...! 
</line><line>Buckler:
Yup! You cod it right! Ora Shipley the First has returned to Shipshape Aquarium! We be the Three Pirate Sisters! Arr! We be out to stop the evil Scalawag League, led by Redstache and the giant octopus!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Well, I don't want to get in the way of their rehearsal... Guess I'd better go.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>DePlume:
Well, if it isn't blue boy! Did you come for my book signing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, Ms. DePlume. There's a book signing?
</line><line>DePlume:
Yes, my new book is just out. It's called "Shipshape Aquarium: Don't Pull the Plug." The book signing will be held here in this room. After all, the vet owes me a favor.
</line><line>Crab:
Yes, she got them to approve the use of the TORPEDO. I'm grateful... ...but why does she keep coming to my lab to bother me every single day?!
</line><line>DePlume:
My next work will be entitled "Sniper: The Penguin Leaves the Nest." 
</line><line>Rifle:
Kree! Kree!
</line><line>Crab:
Gaaaaaah! Stop this cacophony! Why am I surrounded by carping females?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gee, Dr. Crab gets all the ladies... I guess I'll leave him to it... Oops. It's almost time for the show.)</textEffects> 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
Where have you been, Daddy?! Polly and Athena already went in!
</line><line>Pearl:
While we were waiting, I bought some souvenirs to take back to the village.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry to keep you waiting... I bet they'll love your souvenirs back home, Pearls.
</line><line>Pearl:
By the way, I hear a certain <textEffects>someone</textEffects> is going to be in today's show!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A certain someone? <textEffects>(I wonder who it could be?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Ooh! It's almost time! The show's just about to start! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Let's go to the show stage, then.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
I saved you all seats, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh, I can't believe I get to see the show again! I'm so happy, I want to dive in the pool!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You'd better not. I think they'd call security.
</line><line>Buckler:
You're welcome in the pool anytime, Athena! But <textEffects>Redstache</textEffects> is the best swimmer of all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Who have you got playing Redstache's role?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Sasha! Ora and Orla are ready to go!</textEffects> 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, I know that voice!
</line><line>Buckler:
Yup! You min-now it! Marlon is back, and he's playing the role of Redstache! It be the new Swashbuckler Spectacular! Hope ye enjoy it, me buckos!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
And so, our pirates set sail for bluer seas under a sunnier sky. As for me... I set foot into the world of law once more as a full-time lawyer.
