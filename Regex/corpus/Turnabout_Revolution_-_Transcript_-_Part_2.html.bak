<line>Trucy:
Just so you know... I'm not going to take sides!
</line><line>Apollo:
Message received, loud and clear.
</line><line>Trucy:
Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team!
</line><line>Apollo:
S-Sorry, Trucy... <textEffects>(Wow, she's really mad.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault.
</line><line>Trucy:
I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges.
</line><line>Trucy:
Really?
</line><line>Dhurke:
Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Trucy:
I sure hope you're right...
</line><line>Athena:
Sorry I'm late, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday?
</line><line>Athena:
O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark.
</line><line>Apollo:
I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh. Guilty as charged.
</line><line>Apollo:
So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about?
</line><line>Athena: 
Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message?
</line><line>Apollo:
Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case.
</line><line>Athena: 
...A civil case?
</line><line>Apollo:
You act like I'm speaking Swahili here.
</line><line>Athena: 
It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well.
</line><line>Athena: 
Really? Who?
</line><line>Bailiff:
The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Okay, let's do this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena: 
Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Apollo:
No time to explain. Let's go.
</line><line>Athena: 
O-Okay! Right behind you!

<line>
Judge: 
Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's the real deal, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge: 
Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know!
</line><line>Apollo:
I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case.
</line><line>Judge: 
I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship.
</line><line>Athena: 
You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
...What? Do you want to switch sides?
</line><line>Athena: 
Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Mr. Justice. 
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get!
</line><line>Phoenix:
..................
</line><line>Apollo:
..................
</line><line>Athena: 
Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you?
</line><line>Judge: 
Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Staff:
Right, left, right, left, HALT!
</line><line>Atishon:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say: ask not what you can do for your country, but for me!</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding?!
</line><line>Atishon:
Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it?
</line><line>Judge:
You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant!
</line><line>Atishon:
Feh...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
All right. Now would the plaintiff's attorney Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom --- the <textEffects>Crystal of Ami Fey</textEffects>. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return.
</line><line>Atishon:
This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would.
</line><line>Apollo:
The defense asserts the item in question is the <textEffects>Founder's Orb</textEffects>, a sacred relic from Khura'in.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Go on.
</line><line>Apollo:
It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff, -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese nation treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago.
</line><line>Judge:
Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study.
</line><line>Judge:
You don't say... And...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once it was verified it was the real thing.
</line><line>Judge:
I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the <textEffects>Founder's Orb</textEffects> or the <textEffects>Crystal of Ami Fey</textEffects>. That, in turn, will determine the object's <textEffects>rightful owner</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... My imagination, you say?
</line><line>Athena: 
Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he?
</line><line>Apollo:
...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
...Ema?
</line><line>Ema:
Show some manners. We're in court.
</line><line>Apollo:
I know, it's just... This&#160;is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What for?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve!
</line><line>Apollo:
First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job.
</line><line>Ema:
You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there.
</line><line>Apollo:
Why do I feel like I'm on trial here?
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Doctor's Dark Secret --</textEffects></center>
<line>Ema:
The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time.
And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study.
Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan.
It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them.
As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The doctor... is a thief? Why am I hearing about this now?
</line><line>Ema:
Well, "cat burglar" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter.
</line><line>Athena:
A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory?
</line><line>Apollo:
I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. 
</line><line>Ema:
According to the doctor's child... ... he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was <textEffects>honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts</textEffects>. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. 
</line><line>Apollo:
So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it.
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(This is the left hook I did not need.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding.
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination.
</line>

</line>


<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence.
</line><line>Ema:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Apollo:
Take a look at this.
</line><line>Ema:
What about it?
</line><line>Apollo:
This contains an email from the doctor's computer.
</line><line>Judge:
...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data.
</line><line>Judge:
I still don't get it.
</line><line>Apollo:
H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. <textEffects>Paul Atishon-Wimperson</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
I can see why'd he drop "Wimperson" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news.
</line><line>Apollo:
Look closer, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........Ah! H-His initials!
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is <textEffects>Paul Atishon-Wimperson</textEffects>. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. 
</line><line>Ema:
P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson.
</line><line>Ema:
Wait, th-then that means... 
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?!
</line><line>Ema:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer.
</line><line>Apollo:
The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... at the behest of his "benefactor"!
</line><line>Ema:
...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here!
</line><line>Apollo:
It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
And how are you certain that "PAW" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover.
</line><line>Apollo:
Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson!
</line><line>Atishon:
Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
What is your birthday?
</line><line>Atishon:
My birthday? It's <textEffects>July 11</textEffects>, but what's it to you? ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Atishon:
...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right, politician.)</textEffects> Did everyone hear that? He said, "July 11." July 11 -- or rather, "<textEffects>711</textEffects>" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence!
</line><line>Atishon:
.........Wait... Why you sneaky little--!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.)</textEffects> Would the plaintiff care to explain?
</line><line>Atishon:
I-I would like to say... that is q-quite...
</line><line>Apollo:
Quite what?
</line><line>Atishon:
Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. .........
</line><line>Apollo
Um... Any other thoughts?
</line><line>Atishon:
No further comments. I stand by my previous statement.
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law!
</line><line>Atishon:
...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.)</textEffects> Mr. Wright, would you care to respond?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Now we're getting somewhere!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership.
</line><line>Apollo:
...How so?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Otherwise, your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all.
</line><line>Apollo:
You have got to be kidding me!
</line><line>Atishon:
Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather.
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
But in order to win the backing of your so-called "benefactor"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that?
</line><line>Atishon:
...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his doting grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for.
</line><line>Apollo:
Your Honor... Please. <textEffects>(I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atishon:
My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I think the judge is buying it, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all.
</line><line>Ema:
...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done.
</line><line>Phoenix:
By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance.
</line><line>Ema:
You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, umm... <textEffects>(All right, now what?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called "Crystal of Ami Fey." Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin.
</line><line>Atishon:
All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atishon:
My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler.
He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals.
Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power.
As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him.
I am a descendent of that great lord.
As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history!
</line>
<hr />
<line>
Apollo:
<textEffects>(Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon.
</line><line>Apollo:
And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement: "The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad."
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
Can we really trust the memory of an old man?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um...
</line><line>Judge:
Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible.
</line><line>Athena:
Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve.
</line><line>Apollo:
*sigh* You're not helping, Athena...
</line><line>Judge:
You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice.

</line><line>Apollo:
I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique.
</line><line>Athena:
The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, I suppose it would.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan?
</line><line>Atishon:
That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there.
</line><line>Atishon:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a <textEffects>mitamah motif</textEffects> dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in.
</line><line>Judge:
The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features <textEffects>the same pattern as the one found on the orb</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... They do look like the same pattern.
</line><line>Apollo:
Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in!
</line><line>Atishon:
AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!!

</line><line>Phoenix:
The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her?
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese.
</line><line>Judge:
I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm.. At this rate, we are going nowhere fast.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Apollo:
There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere.
</line><line>Atishon:
......... *whew* That's much better.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's his deal?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm listening...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm.. I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: "I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm." What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void.
</line><line>Apollo:
...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his "accident" might have actually been murder.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! <textEffects>(M-Murder?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from his archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was <textEffects>a single volume on psychology</textEffects>. What's more, there was blood on it.
</line><line>Apollo:
And you feel this is important because...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the <textEffects>archeology books</textEffects>. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. 
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf.
</line><line>Apollo:
And that's when the blood got on the book?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books.
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course I do.
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-You do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, what?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered!
</line><line>Apollo:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Athena:
Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!)</textEffects> Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? 
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you?
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would like to request more testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene!
</line><line>Apollo:
He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Athena:
If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? <textEffects>(He was just waiting to spring this trap!!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Heh.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere.

</line><line>Judge:
"Blowback"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death?
</line><line>Apollo:
Come to think of it... 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Ema, who was the first one to discover the body?
</line><line>Ema:
About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?
</line><line>Ema:
It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Wait... You're not saying that...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What?! <textEffects>(Y-You don't say...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right?
</line><line>Atishon:
.........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Aaaaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void!
</line><line>Apollo:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Athena:
A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...!
</line><line>Apollo:
A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor?
</line><line>Athena:
That move had "desperate" written all over it.
</line><line>Apollo:
It's all I've got, so I'm going with it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any...
</line><line>Apollo:
I-I knew it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I do have another witness.
</line><line>Apollo:
You do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Gnrggh!
</line><line>Athena:
A new witness? I wonder who it could be.

Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone.

</line><line>Apollo:
It's... a long story.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster?
</line><line>Sarge:
Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What Happened That Evening --</textEffects></center>
<line>Sarge:
Papa met with someone the night he died.
I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but...
... I did hear him arguing with someone in his study!
From my window, I saw the one designated "Datz" getting ejected from the premises.
After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time.
He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal.

</line><line>Datz:
Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one!
</line><line>Sarge:
It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!!
</line><line>Datz:
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!!
</line><line>Sarge:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Judge:
...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice.

<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>From my window, I saw the one designated "Datz" getting ejected from the premises.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
Sarge:
<textEffects>After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Athena:
So Sarge saw Datz, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out?
</line><line>Athena:
I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Sarge, are you hiding something from me?
</line><line>Sarge:
H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof.
</line><line>Sarge:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Judge:
Would the defense care to explain?
</line><line>Apollo:
It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study there. With his cherished drone, of course.
</line><line>Sarge:
H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?!
</line><line>Judge:
Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something!
</line><line>Sarge:
Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare!
</line><line>Sarge:
A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! Are you all right?!
</line><line>Sarge:
*cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance.
</line><line>Apollo:
Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you?
</line><line>Sarge:
Papa...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night.
</line><line>Sarge:
...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...!
</line><line>Apollo:
...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything.
</line><line>Sarge:
...Grrrrrrr!
</line><line>Apollo:
UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question.
</line><line>Sarge:
Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.)</textEffects> Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety.
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>100%</b></center>
<line>Athena:
...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of <textEffects>discord</textEffects> in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient <textEffects>wants to say something, but can't</textEffects> for some reason.
</line><line>Apollo:
And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic!
</line><line>Athena:
You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here.
</line><line>Judge:
Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify!
</line><line>Judge:
Then by all means, please prong the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before.

</line><line>Athena:
I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart!
</line><line>Sarge:
UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a batle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes!
</line><line>Athena:
You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart.

<textEffects>Brace yourself!</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>I stayed in my room with my drone that evening.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Apollo:
So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right?
</line><line>Athena:
Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next.
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, I'll give it a try.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful.
</line><line>Sarge:
...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!!
</line><line>Athena:
That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should have been. And I think I know why.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- <textEffects>your father's body</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sarge:
I-I saw no such thing!
</line><line>Apollo:
Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see?
</line><line>Sarge:
Err...
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>70%</b></center>
<line>Athena:
Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise!
</line><line>Apollo:
So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw.
</line><line>Sarge:
Ooh... B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand  to lose yet another loved one.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? <textEffects>Am I missing something here?</textEffects>. Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow?
</line><line>Sarge:
M-Maybe...
</line><line>Apollo:
Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder?
</line><line>Sarge:
Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Hmm... This witness is truly a handful.
</line><line>Sarge:
Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state?
</line><line>Athena:
Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. 
</line><line>Apollo:
So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me?
</line><line>Sarge:
Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.
</line><line>Sarge:
In... Out... In... Out...
</line><line>Athena:
And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out!
</line><line>Sarge:
UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!

<textEffects>Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when...</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>So I left my room, but suddenly...</textEffects>

<textEffects>...I got dizzy and passed out.</textEffects>

<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>That's when he must have been killed. If only I hasn't passed out!</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you?
</line><line>Sarge:
Was I...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire.
</line><line>Sarge:
...Y-Yes, that does make sense.
</line><line>Athena:
And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world.
</line><line>Sarge:
What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out.
</line><line>Sarge:
...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wow, the things I take for granted.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself.
</line><line>Apollo:
About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning?
</line><line>Athena:
Just say calm and maybe something will come to you.
</line><line>Sarge:
Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire!
</line><line>Apollo:
The orb... was on fire?
</line><line>Sarge:
Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the "orb" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw <textEffects>Mama</textEffects> appear amid the dancing flames!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>30%</b></center>
<line>Apollo:
Wh-What's going on here?
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died.
</line><line>Apollo:
So let me guess... More therapy?
</line><line>Athena:
Yep. But this time, it seems there's an <textEffects>inconsistency</textEffects> in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sarge:
<textEffects>Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when...</textEffects>
</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa.</textEffects>

</line><line>Sarge:
<textEffects>That's when he must have been killed. If only I hasn't passed out!</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same.
</line><line>Sarge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room.
</line><line>Sarge:
Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice!
</line><line>Apollo:
You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened <textEffects>before your father left</textEffects> to hide the orb.
</line><line>Sarge:
Ah!
</line><line>Apollo:
So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within.
</line><line>Sarge:
S-So, even if I hadn't passed out...
</line><line>Apollo:
That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself.
</line><line>Sarge:
Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Why do you ask?
</line><line>Sarge:
.........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sarge...
</line><line>Sarge:
Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... 
</line>
<center>...I failed to make Papa's wish come true.</center>
<line>Sarge:
.....................
</line><line>???:
...Um, Sarge?
</line><line>Athena:
If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now?
</line><line>Sarge:
...My first step?
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step!
</line><line>Sarge:
................................ 
</line><line>Apollo:
If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... .. the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp.
</line><line>Sarge:
................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! 
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line><line>Sarge:
As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely!
</line>

<line>Apollo:
...............Huh?
</line><line>???:
S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty.
</line><line>Apollo:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy!
</line><line>Athena:
You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned!
</line><line>???:
W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.
</line><line>Apollo:
N-No way...
</line><line>Armie:
Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice!
</line><line>Athena:
S-She's just too cute...
</line><line>Apollo:
So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge?
</line><line>Armie:
Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire.
</line><line>Judge:
Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before.
</line><line>Armie:
My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls.
</line><line>Armie:
I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call.
</line><line>Apollo:
What did you remember?
</line><line>Armie:
It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was <textEffects>the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism</textEffects>. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb!

The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I have a bad feeling about this.
</line><line>Apollo:
Could it be...? <textEffects>Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?</textEffects>

<line>Athena:
Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: "<textEffects>Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return</textEffects>." ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire?
</line><line>Apollo:
The whole stanza seems to suggest that <textEffects>the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my!
</line><line>Armie:
Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves.
</line><line>Armie:
Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes!

Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us!

</line><line>Phoenix:
B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void!
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was  still around at the time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Urrrrrrrgh.
</line><line>Apollo:
Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid.

</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb?
</line><line>Phoenix
.........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course!
</line><line>Apollo:
.......... <textEffects>(H-He can't possibly have hit on something...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix
The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend. And that legend claims that <textEffects>the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? 
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would <textEffects>bestow spiritual power</textEffects> onto the person who solved the riddle.
</line><line>Apollo:
..........Y-You're kidding, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... it's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it?
</line><line>Apollo:
N-No, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb!

</line><line>Apollo:
Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now?

Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important.

When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here.

That's right above the coffee bar.

Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?!
</line><line>Armie:
I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels would take me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Do you know who it was?
</line><line>Armie:
No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights.
</line><line>Apollo:
Maybe it was your father.
</line><line>Armie:
No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him.
</line><line>Apollo:
So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer?
</line><line>Armie:
My thoughts exactly.
</line><line>Apollo:
But you didn't report this to the police?
</line><line>Armie:
...I-It didn't even occur to me.
</line><line>Apollo:
It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing.

</line><line>Phoenix:
We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test.
</line><line>Judge:
I-I see...

<textEffects>(He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?)</textEffects>

Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons can't take it. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff.

What are you talking about? That was already proven false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff!
</line><line>Apollo:
What?!

Very well. You may call your witness.

It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village.
That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window!
Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head.
His weapon of choice: a suitcase.

Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light.
</line><line>Judge:
According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase.

The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable.
</line><line>Atishon:
That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.
</line><line>Apollo:
It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves!
</line><line>Atishon:
Hrrrrrrngh!
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public!
</line><line>Atishon:
Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I...
</line><line>Apollo:
You what?
</line><line>Atishon:
I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head!
</line><line>Apollo:
But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run?
</line><line>Atishon:
D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Sounds more like what you would do.)</textEffects> Then how do you explain the back that he was <textEffects>struck in the back of the head</textEffects>? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk?
</line><line>Atishon:
...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. <textEffects>Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off?</textEffects>

There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny!

From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. <textEffects>The witness saw the murder from... right here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
You've got to be kidding!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But that's--!
</line><line>Apollo:
it is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study.
</line><line>Athena:
I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime!
</line><line>Apollo:
I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room.
</line><line>Athena:
A-Apollo, are you suggesting...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase?
</line><line>Atishon:
Gaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off.
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atishon:
That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer!
</line><line>Athena:
As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, this should be interesting...
</line><line>Apollo::
Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used?
</line><line>Judge:
So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. If they were <textEffects>positioned a certain way</textEffects>... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You can't mean...!
</line><line>Apollo:
I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. <textEffects>Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Th-There...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... That's...
</line><line>Apollo: 
This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in <textEffects>three</textEffects>. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used <textEffects>gravity</textEffects> to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar!
</line><line>Atishon:
Yaaaaaaargh!
</line><line>Apollo: 
That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar.
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-You are?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah!
</line><line>Apollo:
One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack!
</line><line>Atishon:
Aaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?!
</line><line>Atishon:
.........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I possibly have to kill Dr. Buff?!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.)</textEffects> Well, the doctor never returned your "crystal" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. 
</line><line>Atishon:
Nngh...
</line><line>Apollo:
Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end.
</line><line>Atishon:
Uhhh...
</line><line>Apollo:
Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands.
</line><line>Atishon:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah...
</line><line>Apollo:
You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?
</line><line>Atishon:
Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is...

</line><line>Phoenix:
...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder!
</line><line>Apollo:
.........Huh? What do you mean, "don't accuse him"? Why would you even say that. Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interest to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal.
</line><line>Apollo:
Say what?
</line><line>Atishon:
Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Arngh!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...)</textEffects> Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhhh... Ummm... 
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here?

</line><line>Athena:
A-Apollo! Wait!
</line><line>Apollo:
Not you, too, Athena!
</line><line>Athena:
Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I trust Maya is unharmed.
</line><line>Atishon:
I can't really say. But just remember... I'm I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. <textEffects>Consequences of the worst kind</textEffects>, if you catch my drift.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Augh!
</line><line>Atishon:
Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my <textEffects>benefactor</textEffects> at all costs.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do they want that relic for anyway?
</line><line>Atishon:
Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
....Maya? As in Maya Fey?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. 
</line><line>Apollo:
Ms. Fey's <textEffects>being held hostage</textEffects>?
</line><line>Athena:
So it seems.
</line><line>Apollo:
Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this?
</line><line>Athena:
Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out.
</line><line>Apollo:
Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! <textEffects>(So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack! I-I...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry.
</line><line>Judge:
What's gotten into you two?
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atishon:
Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. 
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atishon:
Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation!
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Dhurke:
...Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Dh-Dhurke?
</line><line>Dhurke:
I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with "defeat" and "resignation" written all over your face.
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line>
<center>.........A dragon never yields.</center>
<line>
Dhurke:
Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Dhurke. <textEffects>(A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!)</textEffects> ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. <textEffects>If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>
</line>
<center><b>We have not solved the riddle yet</b></center>
<line>
Apollo:
The legend says that the founder will bestow great power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. <textEffects>But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>
</line>
<center><b>The founder can return though channeling</b></center>
<line>
Apollo:
Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? <textEffects>Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>
</line>
<center><b>A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER</b></center>
<line>
Apollo:
The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............Huh?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage.
</line><line>Atishon:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Apollo:
Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want.
</line><line>Phoenix:
She can?
</line><line>Atishon:
What do you mean, "only Maya Fey"?
</line><line>Apollo:
Think about what the <textEffects>return of the founder</textEffects> really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder.
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner...
</line><line>Dhurke:
It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever!
</line><line>Atishon:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

</line><line>Atishon:
Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer!
</line><line>Apollo:
She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin.
</line><line>Atishon:
Urhgk.
</line><line>Apollo:
Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing.
</line><line>Apollo:
...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you?
</line><line>Atishon:
Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime?
</line><line>Atishon:
Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. 
</line><line>Atishon:
Wh-What?
</line><line>Phoenix
Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
! <textEffects>(Mr. Wright...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney.
</line><line>Atishon:
No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Well?
</line><line>Atishon:
...I've nothing to confess.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?!
</line><line>Atishon:
I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This guy doesn't know when to give up.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Atishon:
Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it!
</line><line>Apollo:
All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's.
</line><line>Atishon:
Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from above?
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor...
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thought of something, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
That... appears to be a statement. But how is it relevant to his case?
</line><line>Apollo:
On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good point!
</line><line>Apollo:
However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Armie:
...someone was pushing my wheelchair.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?!
</line><line>Armie:
I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels would take me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?
</line><line>Atishon:
...Agrk!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need.
</line><line>Apollo: 
Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... It looks like sometimes, things DO get better.
</line><line>Atishon:
Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen!
</line><line>Apollo:
No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial!
</line><line>Atishon:
ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Atishon:
Th-That's...!
</line><line>Apollo:
On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is.
</line><line>Apollo:
While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase... ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away.
</line><line>Atishon:
Ah. Ah. My fellow Kurainians...
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours!
</line><line>Atishon:
Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah!

<center><b>Paul Atishon arrested on murder charges</b></center>
<center><b>and stripped of his electoral win.</b></center>
<line>Atishon:
................Wait, what? No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................

<line>Judge:
M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apollo, I want to thank you for everything.
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha...
</line><line>Athena:
You were amazing today, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
Dhurke:
Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
As it seems  both sides have no objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand?
</line><line>Dhurke:
..........
</line><line>Judge:
This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one!
</line><line>Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might  spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
This court is adjourned!
</line>

<line>Dhurke:
Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution!
</line><line>Apollo:
Revolution... It just doesn't seem real.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Saved him?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you!
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't know about that. <textEffects>(Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books...
</line><line>Dhurke:
Unfortunately, it's not that easy. 
</line><line>Apollo:
What? Why?
</line><line>Dhurke:
A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that.
</line><line>Dhurke:
And the founder's name is only known to <textEffects>the priestess who's been crowned queen</textEffects>. In short, the only person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon?
</line><line>Trucy:
Tsk, that's no fun.
</line><line><textEffects>Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
So, Dhurke, what will you do now?
</line><line>Dhurke:
First, I'll start tracking the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands.
</line><line>Apollo:
Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it?
</line><line>Dhurke:
No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this.
</line><line>???:
Private Justice! 
</line><line>Sarge:
That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud!
</line><line>Apollo: 
Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that.
</line><line>Armie:
It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. 
</line><line>Sarge:
But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight!
</line><line>Athena:
To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah... <textEffects>(And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Armie:
...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow.
</line><line>Armie:
...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir. <textEffects>(What she is up to?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Armie:
.........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa...
</line><line>Apollo:
Sh-Sh-She's... standing?!
</line><line>Dhurke:
Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?!
</line><line>Armie:
The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. 
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Makes sense, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Armie:
I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I's hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, you can do it.
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, Daddy's back!
</line><line>Phoenix:
.....................
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright! <textEffects>(What's that look on his face for?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey?
</line><line>Phoenix:
She's safe... for now.
</line><line>Athena:
Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I'm afraid I have some bad news.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing.
</line><line>Apollo:
The mastermind?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us...
