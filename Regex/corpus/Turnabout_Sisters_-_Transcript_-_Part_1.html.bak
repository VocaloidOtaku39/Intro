<textEffects>Hello? This is Maya.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Hey Maya, it's me.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Well, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I gotcha. So, what is it this time?</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
It's... <textEffects>a clock</textEffects>.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>A clock?</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Huh? It's not working? That's lame!</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Alright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya.

I'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have.

Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be <textEffects>"The Thinker"</textEffects> that swallowed those papers.
</line><line>Mia:
How could you know...?
</line><line>???:
Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.
</line><line>Mia:
I... I should have been more careful.
</line><line>???:
Ho hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.

K-killer...? I'm not--
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.
</line><line>Maya:
W-what?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.

Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good morning! <textEffects>(She looks so tired...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Did I look at her like that?)</textEffects> No, no! I never thought...
</line><line>Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?
</line><line>Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mia:
<textEffects>"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?
</line><line>Mia:
<textEffects>"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?
</line><line>Mia:
<textEffects>"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!
</line><line>Mia:
<textEffects>"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
That's what she said!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...

Huh? Something the matter?
</line><line>Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Maya:
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Maya:
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
When will that happen?
</line><line>Maya:
They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.

No, no, Phoenix Wright. <textEffects>(How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He WAS proven innocent...)</textEffects> Umm... right. And you were...
</line>



<line>Gumshoe:
Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"...

Hey, Dick! Get over here!

Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!

Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!

... <textEffects>(Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...)</textEffects> The... witness?

Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!

<textEffects>(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?)</textEffects> So you've sent her home already, then?

Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!
