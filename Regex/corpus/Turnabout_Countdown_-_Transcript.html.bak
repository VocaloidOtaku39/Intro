Phoenix:
These are dark times, where the law has been reduced to rubble. And it's up to us to restore it to its former glory. "Yeah, I know what you mean. It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Don't you worry, I got a trusty new partner onboard."
</line><line>Girl:
Done!
</line><line>Robot necklace:
Ready to go?
</line><line>Girl:
You bet, let's do this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"She's been with us for half a year, though I can hardly believe it. Anyway, her power will be our greatest weapon."
</line><line>Officer:
Are you alright, miss?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Yeah. It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end."

Heh heh heh! The best thing about bombs is how they erase and destroy... without discretion. Now all I have to do is pin everything on that little girl!

Athena:
<textEffects>(Hmm... Nope! Not feeling nervous at all! It's amazing what a girl can get used to! Even a tense atmosphere like this is no biggie!)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
You doing okay, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Apollo! Y-Yeah, doing great! Like, hum-a-little-tune great!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, yeah? Well, that's good to hear. Although... I could've sworn I heard your voice crack for a second there.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Oof! I'm THAT transparent, huh?)</textEffects> Cracking? N-No, my voice isn't cracking! Nerves of steel, here, I tell you! <textEffects>(This is Apollo Justice. He's a fellow lawyer at the office I work for. Apollo is the lead for the defense on this case. But I'm going to be there at the bench with him, doing what I can to help out. I'll do whatever it takes to defend <span style="color:#E16935">Junie</textEffects>!)</span> Speaking of steel, how are you holding up? That <textEffects>explosion</textEffects> really did a number on you...
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm just happy that you're okay, Athena. Although... I can't pretend I have no connection to this case. That's why I'm gonna see to it that Juniper's name is cleared! And I'm sure you feel much the same way.
</line><line>Athena:
You got that right! I won't rest until <textEffects>Junie</textEffects> is completely cleared of all suspicion!
</line><line>???:
Apollo, Thena... Thank you... for doing this for me.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie!
</line><line>Woods:
...... *cough* *cough, cough*
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, are you okay?
</line><line>Woods:
...Sorry about that. I always seem to go into coughing fits whenever I get nervous. This kind of thing never happens *cough* at home in the forest, though. *cough*
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(This is Juniper Woods. She's my dear, dear childhood friend, and she's also our client for this case. The news keeps repeating that Junie is the "<span style="color:#E16935">alleged bomber</textEffects>"... But that's ridiculous! There's no way Junie would do anything like that!)</span>
</line><line>Woods:
I brought you a little snack, Thena... Just a little something from my garden.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, thanks! So, um... Is this an orange or a tangerine?
</line><line>Woods:
It's an orange! My grandma says... ...that orange is the color of strength and endurance.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, I get it! Strength for the trial, right? <textEffects>(Junie... You're always so good to me. Geez, look at me! Standing here clutching an orange to my chest with tears in my eyes...)</textEffects> Well, don't you worry! We'll be so powerful in there, they won't know what hit them! Right, Apollo?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah... that's right. Come what may... this is one trial... we just can't lose...!
</line><line>Woods:
Apollooooooooo!
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ungh...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Blood is seeping through his bandages! One of his wounds must've reopened. All this time, he was trying to put on a brave face, but he was really overdoing it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mr. Justice!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bailiff:
The trial is about to start, sir. Please proceed to the courtroom.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(What?! Now?! But Apollo's in no state to defend!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
*huff, huff*... Aaaaargh! I... I have to... defend Juniper!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(What are we gonna do?! The trial is about to start, with or without us! There's only one other option I can think of at a time like this... But even if I called <span style="color:#E16935">him</textEffects> now, he'd never get here in time! .........No, wait! There's something else I can do!)</span> Apollo, give me all the evidence for the case.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...? What are you gonna do?
</line><line>Athena:
Bailiff.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Y-Yes, Miss?
</line><line>Athena:
The defense would like to submit a substitution of attorney petition.
</line><line>Woods:
Thena!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're not seriously--
</line><line>Athena:
You just concentrate on getting better. I'll defend Junie!
</line><line>Apollo:
All by yourself?! Athena, stop for a sec and think about what you're saying! You've never once taken a case on alone before, right?!
</line><line>Athena:
Â¡No hay problema! I can handle it! <textEffects>(I think.)</textEffects> But I guess it's really up to you, Junie. Would you be okay with me taking over?
</line><line>Woods:
Um......... Sure. I believe in you, Thena, and that's enough for me.
</line><line>Apollo:
............
</line><line>Athena:
You're worried for me, aren't you? To be honest, I'm pretty nervous, too. I think my heart might just burst out of my chest! But you're in no shape to stand at the bench now. So you'll just have to leave it to me!
</line><line>Apollo:
............ ...All right. I can see your mind's made up anyway. I hate it that I can't be there... but I know you'll give your utmost to defend Juniper!
</line><line>Athena:
You bet I will! Rest assured of that!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(My name is Athena Cykes. I'm still just a newbie, but I'm a lawyer. This is... only the second time I've taken the lead in a defense case. It'll be the first time I stand up there alone, though. But I have to do this! And I'm definitely not about to let anything bad happen to Junie!)</textEffects>

<line></line><center><b>Day 1</b></center><center><b>Court Is Now In Session</b></center><center><b>All Rise</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.
</line><line>Athena:
Th-The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Payne:
The prosecution is also ready, Your Honor. Uh-huh... And what is the meaning of this? I was under the impression that <textEffects>Mr. Red Monkey</textEffects> would be my opponent today.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well, a substitution of attorney petition was submitted just a few moments ago. Due to the <textEffects>explosion in the courthouse</textEffects> yesterday, Mr. Justice is unable to continue.
</line><line>Payne:
I see, I see. Not at all surprised he used that as an excuse to run away. With me as an adversary, who wouldn't want to feign illness in order to escape?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(What?! The nerve of that guy! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind! W-Well, I would if I wasn't so nervous... Argh! This arrogant jerk!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>You arrogant jerk!</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
N-No! Widget!
</line><line>Payne:
Is my hearing getting worse? I could've sworn I heard the defense say something just now.
</line><line>Athena:
N-N-No! You didn't hear anything at all! Especially not from me!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... How odd. I could have sworn I also heard something...
</line><line>Athena:
...Oh, that would be my indispensable partner, <textEffects>Widget</textEffects>. He... sometimes blurts out what I'm thinking.
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. Well then. If that's the case, then it's a clear <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> to what you just stated!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(A contradiction?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
You just stated that you said nothing. However, if that device of yours says what you're thinking... ...then you indeed said I was...what was it? Elegance at work?
</line><line>Athena:
Eeep! <textEffects>(Actually, it was arrogant jerk...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
At any rate, what does it matter if it's a <textEffects>red monkey</textEffects> or a <textEffects>yellow monkey</textEffects> facing me? No fresh-out-of-law-school ROOKIE can defend this witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Payne, I believe that's enough. Let us get back to the case.
</line><line>Payne:
Of course, Your Honor. I'm more than ready to show this little girl why they call me the "Rookie Humiliator."
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I knew it. He really is an arrogant jerk.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>Arrogant jerk!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Cykes. If you continue to insult the prosecution, I will remove you from this court.
</line><line>Athena:
Ack. I'm very sorry... <textEffects>(It was just a knee-jerk reaction...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then... Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, if you please.
</line><line>Payne:
Thank you, Your Honor. Now then. The incident occurred yesterday here at this very courthouse, in Courtroom No. 4. At that time, the trial for a certain <textEffects>bombing</textEffects> was being held in Courtroom No. 4.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, yes. I was presiding over that trial as well. And Mr. Justice was there as the lawyer for the defense.
</line><line>Payne:
A bomb that was being presented as evidence suddenly went off during the trial. It was a terrible incident... and Courtroom No. 4 was completely destroyed. Fortunately, we were able to start evacuation procedures before the explosion occurred. Just a few more seconds and it would've turned into a horrific loss of human life.
</line><line>Judge:
But there was, in fact, one death, was there not?
</line><line>Payne:
That is correct, Your Honor. When Courtroom No. 4 was examined after the blast... ...the body of Detective Candice Arme was discovered. She was to take the stand as a witness later in the trial.
</line><line>Judge:
I suppose she wasn't able to evacuate in time. What a terrible tragedy. I must admit, I stumbled at least ten times myself before I was able to escape.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Maybe the court should see to getting you even shorter robes...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The victim's body was found near the entrance to the courtroom. I suspect she stayed until the very end to help guide the others out safely. Your Honor, allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report... ...and details about the bomb.
</line><line><textEffects>Arme's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Stuffed Animal Bomb added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Okay, I know how this works. All evidence for the trial is filed in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</textEffects>. When I want to check something out, I just touch the <textEffects>Court Record Button</textEffects> (R). I'd better take a peek later.)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, then. Please call the accused to the witness stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woods:
............ *cough*
</line><line>Judge:
Defendant, are you feeling all right? You're looking a bit pale...
</line><line>Woods:
I'm so sorry! I was feeling a bit weak when I first arrived here at the courthouse... *cough* But I... I'm all right.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Junie's really giving it her all! I'd better make sure I do the same!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. If we could please proceed. Your name and occupation, defendant.
</line><line>Woods:
...Juniper Woods... I'm... a h-high school student.
</line><line>Payne:
Ms. Woods, can you confirm you were in the courthouse on the day in question?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes. I came to know Apollo Justice through my friend Thena... *cough* And so... I was there yesterday... to watch his trial and lend my support.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Something's wrong. Junie's really scared.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh heh. Did you know I'm also known as the "Defendant Humiliator"? It looks like I have yet another chance to show everyone how I earned that moniker!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Grr... Does his arrogance know no bounds?! I have to protect Junie no matter what!)</textEffects> Hey you <textEffects>arrogant je</textEffects>-- Er, Prosecutor Payne!
</line><line>Payne:
Hmm? What is it? Do you want me to demonstrate why I'm known as the "Rookie Humiliator" instead?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Deep breaths, Athena. Don't let him get to you.)</textEffects> P-Prosecutor Payne! Junie is telling the truth! Mr. Justice also backed up her claim when we saw him in the Defendant Lobby. And, Junie, he said that he was glad to get the lotus root you gave him, too.
</line><line>Woods:
He was? My grandma says lotus root is good for your eyes. She says they can even help you see into the future!
</line><line>Athena:
They can? Then that's the perfect present for a lawyer! <textEffects>(And if that's true, I guess he must not have eaten them...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... A sweet, meek girl like this, blowing a courtroom to bits? I must say it's very hard to believe.
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
Now, now, Your Honor. Don't let her seemingly innocent appearance fool you. The defendant had <textEffects>a motive</textEffects> for committing this crime.
</line><line>Woods:
Th-That's not true...! I don't have any kind of motive...! A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
</line><line>Payne:
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant. However, that doesn't matter. The only thing that does is that her objective was the <textEffects>destruction</textEffects> of Courtroom No. 4 itself.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?! Why in the world would Ms. Woods want to do that?!
</line><line>Payne:
Mm-hmm. That's a very good question, coming from a novice such as yourself. But first, a question for the defendant. Have you ever been brought up on <textEffects>false charges</textEffects>?
</line><line>Woods:
What?! Wh-Why, yes... Yes, I have...
</line><line>Payne:
And did that experience cause you to harbor a grudge against the court system?
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
Now, wait just one minute! If that kind of thing was a motive for blowing things up... ...then every one of our clients would turn into bombers!
</line><line>Judge:
That's a valid point. We would have a single courthouse left standing in the land.
</line><line>Payne:
I concede the accused isn't the only one who might bear resentment against the courts. But Ms. Woods is the only person who could have committed this crime. Why? Because we have some <textEffects>decisive evidence</textEffects> that proves the defendant's guilt.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Decisive, huh? I'll believe it when I see it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
It involves a very <textEffects>unique aspect</textEffects> of the bomb itself, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
And what exactly was so unique about it?
</line><line>Payne:
Hmm... Why don't we have Ms. Cykes answer that question?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? M-Me?
</line><line>Payne:
Mm-hmm. I notice that you appear to be very nervous. And, well, gentleman that I am... ...I'd like to offer you the chance to gain some confidence with such an easy question.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Could he BE any more condescending?! Really! What a thoroughly unpleasant man!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>"L" is for "Loser"!</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Harrumph! What did it just say?!
</line><line>Athena:
N-Nothing. Not a single thing... <textEffects>(Now, let's see... What was I supposed to do at a time like this...? Oh, I know! The <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</textEffects>! The information I need is somewhere in the <textEffects>Court Record</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
All right, Ms. Cykes. Let's hear your answer. <textEffects>What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
Mr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?! It was stuffed inside a stuffed animal! Its evil intentions covered up by <textEffects>a cute exterior</textEffects>!
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. Very good. Have a cookie. The bomb that went off in the courtroom was indeed hidden inside a stuffed animal.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(There, how do you like that? Not bad, huh? I AM fine, just like I said from the start! I can do this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, as I recall, the bomb was stuffed inside a stuffed animal the whole time. I never even got to take a look at it. But what connection does this impish elephant have with the defendant?
</line><line>Payne:
The answer to that question lies in another piece of evidence, which I have here.
</line><line>Judge:
And what, pray tell, is this? It appears to be a little singed.
</line><line>Payne:
It's a tail, Your Honor. The tail of a poor <textEffects>victim</textEffects> of the explosion.
</line><line>Judge:
This is incredible! Are you saying it's Detective Arme's tail?!
</line><line>Payne:
Your Honor is so very close, but no. It belongs to this stuffed animal. It's called the Phony Phanty. A rather unpleasant name, if you ask me.
</line><line>Judge:
He's the mascot for a campaign to eliminate false evidence and false charges, is he not?
</line><line>Payne:
Exactly. His motto is "Phony Evidence is just Trunked Up!"
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(That's so wrong on so many levels.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The Phony Phanty's tail is made of vinyl cloth. And we found something very interesting on its surface... the <textEffects>defendant's fingerprints</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(WH-WHAAAAAT?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The Phony Phanty provided the prosecution with all the evidence we needed. It clearly proves that the accused handled the bomb!
</line><line>Woods:
I... Uhhh... Eep!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(But that doesn't make any sense! Why would Junie's fingerprints be on it?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That does appear to be pretty irrefutable evidence... The court accepts it into evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Phony Phanty Tail added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Woods, do you have an explanation for this?
</line><line>Woods:
...I... I don't understand... I... *cough, cough*
</line><line>Payne:
How about you, Ms. Cykes? Do you have any plausible explanation to refute this decisive piece of evidence?
</line><line>Athena:
W-Well, I... uh... <textEffects>(I-I can't do it! I can't think of a single thing! But I'd better come up with something... for Junie's sake!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
If you can't produce an answer, we could always go straight to the <textEffects>ruling</textEffects>, if you prefer.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Ack, no! I have to say something -- fast! Oh, no! I can't get my voice to work! Why now, of all times...?!)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>(I thought I <span style="color:#E16935">overcame</textEffects> this already... Maybe I'm still not ready to stand in court?)</span></center>

Payne:
As you can see, there is no room for debate.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Objection!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, it's you...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Sorry it took me so long to get here, Athena. Apollo explained the whole thing to me over the phone. He asked me to come help you out in his place.
</line><line>Athena:
...Thanks for coming. I hate to admit it, but I was having a real rough time on my own.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know. I think you were doing just fine, all things considered. And you hung in there, giving me enough time to get here. Now, let's turn things around!
</line><line>Athena:
You got it, Boss!
</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho ho. Look who showed up out of the blue. If it isn't Mr. Phoenix Wright. You always manage to surprise me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Mr. Payne has called for an early ruling... ...but I believe there are still many things that need to be deliberated. How did Ms Woods's fingerprints wind up on the stuffed animal tail? How was the bomb even detonated? Until these questions are answered, I assert it's impossible for a fair ruling to be made!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... You are absolutely right. Let us continue from where we left off. I assume you have no objections, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. None at all, Your Honor.
</line><line>Woods:
*cough, cough*............ ......*cough, cough* *cough*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ms. Woods really looks like she's having a hard time.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Junie's really struggling, Mr. Wright. I get the sense she's afraid of the courtroom itself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because of yesterday?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah. It was understandably very <textEffects>traumatic</textEffects> for her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Poor thing. And here she is, back at the courthouse again, being so brave. I'd like to make a request, Your Honor. If at all possible, I'd like to have Ms. Woods rest in the lobby.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Given the defendant's condition... Very well, I grant special permission.
</line><line>Athena:
You go get some rest, Junie, and leave the rest to us!
</line><line>Woods:
Okay... Thank you. Sorry about this... *cough, cough*
</line><line>Payne:
Phoenix Wright... I've been looking forward to meeting you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It's been a while, Mr. Payne.
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. You're more clueless than I'd heard. I do believe you mean, "<textEffects>How do you do?</textEffects>" For I... am Gaspen Payne! I am the younger brother of your longstanding rival, Winston Payne!
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAT?! <textEffects>("Longstanding rival"...? When were we ever rivals, let alone "longstanding"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
You'll see, Mr. Wright. I will cleanse Winston of the disgrace he met with at your hands!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(*sigh* Looks like this royal Payne is going to be as thoroughly unpleasant as the other.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh heh. Your Honor! The prosecution would now like to call a decisive witness to the stand. This witness will testify as to how the accused detonated the bomb in the courtroom.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Please call your witness, Mr. Payne!
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:

Witness, your name and occupation, please.

W-Witness?

He sounds exactly like a robot...

</line><line>Tonate:
I can.

<textEffects>(He can!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO SPEAK. SPEAKING IS INEFFICIENT. ENERGY EXPENDITURE: SPEAKING &gt; TYPING UNDERSTAND?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm.. What an odd witness.
</line><line>Payne:
Mr. Tonate was in charge of the bomb for that trial and was there when it went off.
</line><line>Judge:
Being a bomb squad specialist, do you have any relation to the defendant?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>NEGATIVE. I FIRST MET THE GIRL WHILE ON THIS JOB. MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY THE POLICE. I KNOW ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM. HOWEVER, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED THE BODY OF THE VICTIM.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Shocked?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... So he was the first to discover the body, was he?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
He is here to testify about the circumstances surrounding the moment of the explosion.

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So even though the bomb was supposed to be disarmed, it somehow got switched on?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>PRECISELY. ACTIVATING THE TIMER IS VERY SIMPLE. 1. CONNECT WIRES 2. SWITCH ON TIMERA MONKEY COULD DO IT. I AM SURE EVEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO, MR. WRIGHT.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Uh, I guess this makes you the Blue Monkey in this barrel of fun, Boss...
</line><line>Phoenix:
*ahem* I'd now like to begin my cross-examination-- Huh?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Tonate...! What is that?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>HH-3000... AKA: A BOMB.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A B-BOMB?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Great googly moogly!
</line><line>Payne:
Yeeeaaaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Tonate! I-I demand that you disarm it this instant!
</line><line>Tonate:
Disassembly complete. <textEffects>HMPH. 5.3 SECONDS. 0.2 SECONDS SHORT OF MY PERSONAL BEST.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?! I'm not exactly a spring chicken, you know!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>THIS IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE HH-3000. IT IS USED TO PRACTICE DISARMING BOMBS. DISARM = SUCCESS. EXPLOSION = FAILURE.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
An exact replica of the bomb that exploded, is it? So that's what it looked like.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I SUBMITTED A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE REAL BOMB TAKEN JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL. DIMENSIONS: 10" H x 10" W x 10" D WEIGHT: 12 LBS... A PERFECT REPLICATION.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Your bomb does appear to be a very good copy, indeed.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YES, HOWEVER I COULD NOT REPLICATE THE DETONATION MECHANISM. IT HAS A VERY PUZZLING WIRING SETUP. IT IS REGRETTABLE I COULD NOT REPLICATE IT.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Witness, that's enough! There's no need to replicate anything here!
</line><line><textEffects>HH-3000 Bomb updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
And now if the defense would begin their cross-examination-- Hm? Where has Ms. Cykes gone to?
</line><line>Athena:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena, you can come out now.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, Mr. Wright! Let's get to work!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess you were pretty scared, huh?
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What?! I don't know what you're talking about!
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>She was about to bolt!</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, put a sock in it, Widget!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(*sigh* As transparent as ever...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Now, let's see... Where were we...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We were at the "<textEffects>cross-examination</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! Cross-examination! Of course!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She seems disoriented. I wonder if she's all right... Maybe I should ask Athena if she remembers how to cross-examine... to help her focus.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
If you can't find any contradictions... ...and you <textEffects>flub up too often</textEffects>, don't be afraid to ask me for help! Press X to consult with me when the <textEffects>Consult</textEffects> panel appears. I'll let you know where I think the <textEffects>suspicious statement</textEffects> is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sounds good. I'll be counting on you if I get in a bind. All right. It's <textEffects>cross-examination</textEffects> time!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- When the Bomb Went Off --</textEffects></center>
<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>THE BOMB WAS ORIGINALLY DISARMED BY ME, THEN TRANSPORTED HERE AS EVIDENCE.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>BOMB NAME: HH-3000 OPERATED BY TIMER OR WITH A REMOTE</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I WAS WATCHING FROM THE GALLERY WHEN I SUDDENLY BECAME ALARMED.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I SAW THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS COUNTING DOWN.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
So you're trying to find testimony that conflicts with the evidence, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Listening carefully to Mr. Tonate's testimony is just the first step. After that, it's a matter of taking a look at any evidence that seems relevant.
</line><line>Athena:
Remember that you can touch "<textEffects>Present</textEffects>" (R) when you want to open the Court Record! If you find evidence that conflicts with the testimony, "<textEffects>Present</textEffects>" (X) it! Let's see... This testimony is about when the bomb went off... So I'd think what state it was in at the time would be pretty important!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... A bomb that didn't look like a bomb because it was inside a stuffed animal, huh...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So you say you saw the bomb's countdown, is that right?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>OF COURSE. I CLEARLY SAW IT COUNTING DOWN TO ZERO.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
And I say... that you are CLEARLY lying!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is no way you could have seen the bomb's timer. After all, the bomb was concealed inside a stuffed animal.
</line><line>Tonate:
!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate! How can you claim to know the bomb was about to go off... ...when you couldn't even see the timer?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>AAAAAAAGH! BUT THAT IJLS KDSOI EDJMB9I A LAJ72Z OIQE AKCXW!</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What?! NOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Judge:
That does seem like a glaring inconsistency, indeed! Witness, how do you explain this?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WELL... I... I...</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh! That was great, Mr. Wright! You found a contradiction right off the bat!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Always remember, Athena. When you find an inconsistency in a witness's testimony, there's always a reason behind it. It could be a lie, a hidden meaning, a secret... Whatever it is, it's up to us to dig it out.
</line><line>Athena:
And pointing out every contradiction we find is the best way to do it, right, Boss?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now the question is, what can we dig out of Mr. Tonate?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WELL, LET ME SEE... I... UH... NO, NO, NO. THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE... OH, YES! YES, OF COURSE! I REMEMBER NOW! THE SOUND! I KNEW BECAUSE OF THE SOUND!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Sound? What sound?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WHEN THE TIMER OF THIS TYPE OF BOMB IS SWITCHED ON, IT BEEPS SOFTLY. BEEP... BEEP... BEEP... IT IS THE SOUND OF THE BOMB COUNTING DOWN.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
A beeping noise, you say? I suppose it would be possible to notice that, even with the bomb inside the stuffed animal.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I SIMPLY MADE A MISTAKE. MY BAD.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
How in the world did you hear such a tiny little sound all the way from the gallery?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>LISTENING FOR THE SOUND OF A BOMB'S TIMER IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY WORK. I CONSTANTLY UNDERGO TRAINING SO THAT I WILL NEVER MISS IT.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I hardly think "training" would help you hear something so soft from so far away... <textEffects>(What now?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>ARE YOU MAKING LIGHT OF THE FINE SCIENCE OF DISARMING BOMBS? IT IS A SOLEMN MISSION THAT I PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE TO PERFORM. WHAT KIND OF SPECIALIST WOULD I BE IF I COULD NOT HEAR A BOMB TIMER?</textEffects> It's not like disassembling a toaster, you know!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now he's just showing off.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
You keep asserting that the sound was too tiny to hear, but the only tiny thing here... ...is your skill as a lawyer! Being suspicious is not an attractive quality you know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And you're just overflowing with attractive qualities, are you...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Or perhaps you have some proof that Mr. Tonate did not hear the sound?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... no, but... <textEffects>(...it still seems totally suspect... But it's going to be really hard to prove that he DIDN'T hear something...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
If I have this correct, the prosecution's argument is that... ...someone reactivated the bomb before it was brought into the courtroom. What I don't understand, Mr. Payne, is why you believe that person to be Ms. Woods.
</line><line>Payne:
That's simple, Your Honor: Mr. Tonate happened to be there when it happened. He was there when the defendant rearmed the bomb.
</line><line>Judge:
What's this, now?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>IT HAPPENED BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTED. IT WAS WHEN DETECTIVE ARME AND I WERE TRANSPORTING THE BOMB. WE BROUGHT THE BOMB TO THE LOBBY FOR THE DEFENSE. BOMB = EVIDENCE. THE LAWYER WANTED TO SEE IT BEFORE THE START OF THE TRIAL.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Looking for a chance to get at the bomb, Ms. Woods was already there in that lobby. Her goal was surely to rearm the bomb and steal the <textEffects>remote switch</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The remote switch?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YES. THE SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE BOMB REMOTELY. DUH. IT HAS BEEN MISSING EVER SINCE THE INCIDENT.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Missing Remote Switch added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I AM PARTIALLY TO BLAME. I LEFT THE BOMB AND REMOTE ON TOP OF THE TRANSPORT CASE... ...AND THEY WERE REARMED AND STOLEN WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH THE LAWYER.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The defendant then used the remote from inside the courtroom to start the timer.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
How can you assert so unequivocally that the bomb was rearmed in the lobby?!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
The bomb was safely secured in the <textEffects>transport case.</textEffects> The only time it was outside of the case was in that lobby. Therefore, that was the one and only opportunity anyone had to meddle with it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Someone other than Mr. Tonate could have opened the case and taken the bomb out.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>IMPOSSIBLE. THE TRANSPORT CASE IS ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO ME. DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND I HAVE THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN OPEN THE CASE.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Bomb Transport Case added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nevertheless! Mr. Payne's assertion is nothing more than conjecture! You have no proof that it was Ms. Woods who stole the remote switch!
</line><line>Payne:
And by the same token, you have no proof that it wasn't her. But what I DO have is a piece of evidence that proves the defendant handled the bomb.
</line><line>Phoenix:
AH! That TAIL!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>FIVE MINUTES, TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS, TWO POINT THREE DECISECONDS. THE DEFENSE'S ADVANTAGE LASTED A MERE FIVE MINUTES.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Urk. Talk about a rotten hand... As long as they have her fingerprints as their trump card, I'm at a big disadvantage.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It appears we will have to hear from the defendant herself once more.
</line><line>Payne:
I wholeheartedly agree, Your Honor. I would like to recall Ms. Woods to the stand.
</line><line>Judge:
I trust you have no objections, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm worried about her condition, but we DO need her testimony. On the other hand... ...I'm not sure I want to make Athena mad...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
...I can read your feelings you know, Boss.
</line><line>Phoenix:
! <textEffects>(Guess there's no hiding from her, huh...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry. I know we need her testimony. But if anybody picks on her again, they'll pay.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Guess she's already at Anger Level 1...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry. I'll stop the proceedings before I let anything bad happen to her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>IN THAT CASE, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE. BUT BEFORE I DO, THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING. MR. WRIGHT... IS IT?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me? Yes?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>DISMANTLING BOMBS IS MY JOB. DISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grrr! This guy is hiding something! I just know it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Please go out to the lobby and bring back the defendant!
</line>

<line>Woods:
............
</line><line>Athena:
Junie!
</line><line>Woods:
...Hi, Thena.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She looks even worse off than before...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, Junie! We're here for you!
</line><line>Woods:
Thanks, Thena. And I'll do my best, too...
</line><line>Payne:
You blew up the courtroom because you bear resentment against the courts, correct?
</line><line>Woods:
N-No! Of course not!... *cough* I...
</line><line>Payne:
What's that you say? I can barely hear you.
</line><line>Woods:
I... I... haven't done anything wrong... This prosecutor's scary...
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
What an impudent little girl. Stop acting innocent and tell the truth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is getting ugly...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
You rearmed the bomb because you wanted to blow up the courthouse! Admit it! That's why you went to the lobby where Mr. Justice was, isn't that right?!
</line><line>Woods:
Uuugghhh... Ahh!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright... Can I go give that prosecutor a smack?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What?! Of course not! Do we have to review Courtroom Manners 101 again?!
</line><line>Athena:
We can't let a creep that bullies innocent girls like this off so easily!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I haven't forgotten about how he treated you.
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry about me, just help Junie! Her heart's crying out! She's so scared... so very scared!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like Athena's picking something up with her <span style="color:#E16935">heightened sense of hearing</textEffects>... And it sounds like this time it's <textEffects>the voice of Ms. Woods's heart</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Payne:
Don't deny it! You stole the remote switch and used it in the courtroom, didn't you?!
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
Your Honor, please put a stop to this! Mr. Payne is badgering the defendant!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Ms. Woods does seem quite frightened. Mr. Payne, I ask that you behave more like a gentleman.
</line><line>Payne:
Ah, but don't you know, Your Honor? There is no more a gentle man in this world than I.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh, as if a gentleman, or even a "gentle man", would behave like he does! Don't let that rude ruffian win!
</line><line>Woods:
Theeena...! *sniffle*
</line><line>Payne:
How dare you call a gentleman such as I a "rude ruffian"?! I'll have you know I attend a manners class every Saturday. I'm more than just a mere gentleman -- I'm a GENTEEL-man!
</line><line>Athena:
Not when you're terrorizing a young lady you're not! I'd demand my money back from that manners class if I were you!
</line><line>Payne:
Urk...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I should probably be the adult here and stop the two of them, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Payne, that will be enough.
</line><line>Payne:
Certainly, Your Honor. No further questions. Let's move on to the defendant's testimony. Ms. Woods, please share with the court what you were doing when the bomb went off.
</line><line>Woods:

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- When the Bomb Went Off --</textEffects></center>
<line>Woods:
Well, that day... *cough* I was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*
The bomb went off... *cough*
*cough* And rubble started falling... It fell on top of me... *cough, cough*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Junie's clearly in pain, being forced to recall the bombing like this... She can't even get her words out!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This isn't going to work, so what now...? Hey, wait a minute! Even if she can't vocalize what she wants to say, we can listen to what's inside her heart! Yes, now's the perfect time to use Athena's <span style="color:#E16935">power</textEffects>!)</span> You can hear it, can't you, Athena? The cries of Ms. Woods's heart?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, and they sound incredibly strained. She's so scared... I think she could collapse at any second!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Athena has a unique ability, you see. With her finely-tuned sense of hearing, she can hear the words of a witness's heart. In essence, she can sense how a person is <span style="color:#E16935">really feeling</textEffects> from the tone of their voice. Guess it's all up to Athena and her special ability now!)</span> Athena, I want you to use the analytical psychology you studied... ...and listen to <textEffects>the testimony of Ms. Woods's heart</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
...Okay, Boss! I'll give it a go! After all, this is the whole reason I put all that effort into studying analytical psychology! Auf geht's! Let's do this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So your holographic thingamabob can show us <textEffects>how Ms. Woods is feeling</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Athena:
In a nutshell, yes. The <textEffects>emotions</textEffects> and <textEffects>images</textEffects> that I picked up on just now while listening to her testimony... ...I can enter all of that into Widget and use the Mood Matrix to analyze them. There <textEffects>mood markers</textEffects> here reflect fluctuations in Junie's emotions. When she feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the "<textEffects>Happy</textEffects>" marker will light up. When she feels angry or frustrated, the "<textEffects>Angry</textEffects>" marker will react. When she feels sadness or is frightened by a memory, the "<textEffects>Sad</textEffects>" marker will blink. And when she feels surprised or confused, the "<textEffects>Surprised</textEffects>" marker will let us know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, with your special ability and Widget's Mood Matrix program... ...we can track how Ms. Woods is feeling as she testifies. Talk about the wonders of technology...
</line><line>Athena:
Yup! Now, let's give it a shot! I'm picking up on some kind of discord -- or noise -- in Junie's heart.
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>100%</b></center>
<line>
Athena:
See here? This is what the noise looks like in the Mood Matrix. It's a result of inconsistencies between her testimony and her feelings. If we can pinpoint their inconsistencies, the noise level should drop!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay! It's time to listen to Ms. Woods's <span style="color:#E16935">true testimony</textEffects>!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woods:
<textEffects>Well, that day... *cough*</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
<textEffects>I was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
<textEffects>The bomb went off... *cough*</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
<textEffects>*cough* and rubble started falling...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Woods:
<textEffects>It fell on top of me... *cough, cough*</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I think I have a good grasp on Junie's emotional state now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This power of Athena's is incredible...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
And I'm seeing an <textEffects>unexpected emotion</textEffects> that's inconsistent with the rest of her testimony!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Already?!
</line><line>Athena:
Look at this! When she says, "It fell on top of me," the "<textEffects>Happy</textEffects>" marker is reacting!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, look at that. That IS odd!
</line><line>Athena:
There must be a reason for this contradictory emotion! We just need to do some digging! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...touch "<textEffects>Pinpoint</textEffects>" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Widget is registering <span style="color:#E16935">joy</textEffects> when Ms. Woods recalls the rubble falling on her. There must be a reason for this unexpected emotion!)</span> Ms. Woods! As the rubble was falling, was there also something that made you feel <textEffects>happy</textEffects>?
</line><line>Woods:
What?! *cough*
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! The feeling of happiness is spreading throughout Junie's heart! Keep going on this point, and I bet Junie will start to calm down.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Great! Let's hear what she has to say!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
Um... *cough* Just as I was about to escape the courtroom... the bomb went off. I was so startled... I tripped. And then rubble started falling on top of me...! I really thought I was done for... But just then... Apollo came and rescued me!
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo?
</line><line>Woods:
He used his own body to shield me from the rubble...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that's when he sustained those injuries...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
How do you feel, Junie? Did talking about Apollo give you some courage?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes. Apollo is... just like the sun -- strong and bright and warm. Just talking about him makes me feel like a leaf undergoing photosynthesis.
</line><line>Athena:
And see? Your coughing stopped all of a sudden.
</line><line>Woods:

Looks like we were able to draw out some new testimony.
</line><line>Athena:
Hee hee. Pretty neat, huh? But there's still some noise left, meaning there must still be some discord in Junie's heart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... I guess we'll have to keep going, then.
</line><line>Athena:
Let me input this new information and <textEffects>update</textEffects> the Mood Matrix, and we'll be good to go! You remember what to do, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When I find an unexpected emotion, I should touch "<textEffects>Pinpoint</textEffects>" (L)...?
</line><line>Athena:
That's right! And then you select the unexpected emotion from the mood markers. If we can find the reason for the discord in her heart... ...then we should be able to draw even more new testimony out!

<textEffects>But then Apollo came and rescued me!</textEffects>

<line>Athena:
I can see some discord in Junie's heart when I listen to her voice. There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...touch "<textEffects>Pinpoint</textEffects>" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You were <textEffects>happy</textEffects> when Mr. Justice rescued you, weren't you?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes... I was really happy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But was there also something you felt <textEffects>sad</textEffects> about at the same time?
</line><line>Woods:
Sad?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The reason I ask is... ...when you were describing how you were rescued, we sensed a little <textEffects>sadness</textEffects>, too.
</line><line>Woods:
......Oh! I think it's probably because of <textEffects>Bum Rap Rhiny</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Bum Rap Rhiny</textEffects>? <textEffects>(Well, what do you know? Something new!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
That's right. I... I brought my stuffed animal, <textEffects>Bum Rap Rhiny</textEffects>, to watch the trial with me. <textEffects>Bum Rap Rhiny</textEffects> and <textEffects>Phony Phanty</textEffects> are brothers.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who knew that the legal world could inspire a whole line of merchandise...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
I had Bum Rap Rhiny with me while I was watching the trial... But it wasn't until Apollo saved me that I realized I'd lost him as I was running away... My poor Rhiny! A victim of that terrible bomb! Oh, I know! You can see what he looks like in this poster! It's for the campaign to eradicate fake evidence and false charges.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Phony Phanty and Bum Rap Rhiny, huh... Nothing against the campaign, but why an elephant and a rhinoceros...?)</textEffects>

Mr. Wright! I don't sense any discord in Junie's heart anymore!

So I guess that means we managed to draw out all of her testimony.
</line><line>Athena:
That's right! I'll just make an update with the new info and we'll have the whole picture! So do you think her new testimony will help?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Absolutely. I don't know what I would've done without you, Athena! <textEffects>(So Bum Rap Rhiny was in that courtroom when the bomb went off. Now that we know that, it changes the meaning of that other piece of evidence! All I have to do is "Present" it... at the right statement!)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, I know this trial has been very hard for you. But you can relax now. You are, without a doubt, innocent.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What wild assertion are you making now?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My "wild assertion" is simply this: the two stuffed animals were mixed up. The tail the defendant's fingerprints were found on wasn't that of Phony Phanty. It was the tail of her gallery companion, Bum Rap Rhiny!
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
What?! What nonsense is that?! I concede they're both stuffed animals, yes, but they're completely different characters! An elephant and a rhino. They're as distinct as a defense lawyer and a prosecutor!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But are they really so different? Both defense lawyers and prosecutors strive to protect the peace through law.
</line><line>Athena:
Even elephants and rhinos have some similar characteristics. They're both gray, for example!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anyway, this poster is all I need to prove my assertion to be true. <textEffects>If I may direct the court's attention here, you'll clearly see how the two got mixed up!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Well! Would you look at that! The two tails are exactly the same!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, exactly. The two stuffed animals are based on entirely different animals... ...but the design of their tails is exactly the same!
</line><line>Payne:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! As long as the possibility exists that the tail belongs to Bum Rap Rhiny... ...we can no longer consider it to be decisive proof that the defendant handled the bomb. As things stand, I consider the charges against the accused unsubstantiated. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
Oh, um... Y-Yes, of course, Your Honor...
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh, that was great, Mr. Wright! You turned things right around!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. It's not over yet, but at least we managed to hold out this long.
</line><line>Judge:
I believe this brings our proceedings for today to a close. Mr. Payne, I'm afraid you have some serious investigating ahead of you.
</line><line>Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, let us reconvene tomorrow. Court is adjourned!

That was so exciting, Boss! We did it! True to form, you managed to just barely pull it off at the very last moment!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("True to form"? Gee, I never knew you had such a glowing opinion of me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
...Thank you for everything you're doing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You did great, Ms. Woods. You really stuck it out.
</line><line>Athena:
And you got really brave at the end, just when we needed you most, Junie! Thanks to you, we were able to turn things around!
</line><line>Woods:
Well, you were the one who gave me that courage, Thena.
</line><line>Athena:
Really? Heh heh. Thanks. So, be honest -- was I any help at all?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course! Without you, we would've never gotten out of that tight spot.
</line><line>Athena:
That's good to hear! I may still have a lot to learn, but you can bet I'm going to give it my all! I'll be so good that, one day, you'll call me your partner!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's what I like to hear! <textEffects>(Analytical psychology... The ability to solve the riddles of a person's heart. Athena's true potential is beginning to really shine through now.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, where's Apollo, anyway?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Good question... <textEffects>(I almost forgot about him.)</textEffects> I assumed he'd still be here in the lobby.
</line><line>Woods:
Oh, I know! Maybe he's still in <textEffects>Courtroom No. 4</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Courtroom No. 4? What would he be doing at the scene of the explosion?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
When I came out to the lobby to rest, I told Apollo about Bum Rap Rhiny... I told him I dropped Rhiny in the courtroom as I was trying to escape before the blast. And then... ...Apollo said he had an idea where Rhiny might be, so we went to take a look together.
</line><line>Athena:
Huh. I guess Apollo can be pretty nice when he wants to be.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you went looking for Rhiny together before you were called back into Courtroom No. 5?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes... I'd had some time to rest so I was able to go and look for him. But then they called me into Courtroom No. 5 to testify. Apollo insisted on staying there, though...
</line><line>Athena:
With all those injuries? I wonder how he's managing?
</line><line>Woods:
I think Apollo might have figured something out...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... Wonder what it was...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
He told me, "I'm going to look for evidence to clear your name, Juniper."
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Just maybe, he found some new piece of evidence...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Anyway, we'd better go and get him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good idea.

............ Oh, hey, did you read the paper this morning, Boss?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? The paper? That came out of left field.
</line><line>Athena:
You didn't read it? Then you don't know the big news! Somebody spotted an abominable snowman waaaay up in the mountains!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Tell me you know the difference between a paper and a tabloid, Athena!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
It might show up in the forest where you live, Junie. So you'd better watch out! Okay?!
</line><line>Woods:
............
</line><line>Athena:
............ You really should read the story for yourself. I couldn't even begin to do it justice.
</line><line>Woods:
! "Justice"...?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?

Oh, poor Apollo! And it's all my fault! *sniffle* Theeeeenaaa! *sob*
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Junie! What was I thinking?! I'm so sorry!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
What we found yesterday... ...was not Apollo's dead body... thank goodness. He'd been assaulted by someone with a blow to his head, and was lying unconscious. We rushed him to the hospital right away, and it looks like he's going to pull through. <textEffects>(But it was still quite a shock to stumble onto a scene like that...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Is Ms. Woods all right, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I managed to get her to stop crying. Now she's resting on that sofa over there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess she really feels responsible for what happened to Apollo.
</line><line>Athena:
Poor Junie. She believes that the reason Apollo was attacked... ...is because he was helping her look for something in that courtroom.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? <textEffects>(Guess I can see why she'd think that...)</textEffects> By the way, how are you doing?
</line><line>Athena:
Who, me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, you. I know you're concerned about Ms. Woods, but are YOU all right?
</line><line>Athena:
Me?! I-I'm doing just fine, boss! I mean, yeah, it was a huge shock, but I'm all right! People who've studied analytical psychology are great at times like these. After all, they've learned how to control their own emotions, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Somehow, I don't think it's as easy as she makes it sound. But there's no denying she's a real trooper.)</textEffects> Apollo doesn't remember a thing, does he?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah... He can't recall anything from the time right before he was assaulted. Nothing about what he was doing in Courtroom No. 4, or who assaulted him. The doctor said it's probably due to that hit he took to the head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Assaulted in a court of law and losing your memory at that... I know how that feels...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
But who in the world would do such a thing, huh, Mr. Wright?! Grr! Just WAIT till I get my hands on the coward who hurt our Apollo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, now, Athena... I thought you said you were in control of your emotions. Let's just focus on helping Ms. Woods, okay? <textEffects>(But I admit I'm just as upset as you.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
O-Okay, Boss! You're right. Apollo's assailant can wait until after we clear Junie's name!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's the spirit! <textEffects>(Now, let's see... I'd better check the Court Record one more time before the trial starts. If memory serves, when I have more than six pieces of evidence... I should be able to switch pages with [D-Pad] or [Control Stick].)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Earth to Mr. Wright! I'm ready whenever you are!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Let's get ready to rumble!
</line><line>Athena:
You bet!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(With everything that happened with Apollo, I didn't have time for a proper investigation. I can't let that stop me, though. I have to get this right, for Ms. Woods's sake, and Apollo's, too!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is also ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, then. I believe I instructed the prosecution to further their investigation. Were you able to locate the <textEffects>remote switch</textEffects> in question?
</line><line>Payne:
I'm afraid the <textEffects>remote switch</textEffects> is still missing, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I must say I'm disappointed, Mr. Payne. Not angry, just disappointed.
</line><line>Payne:
I-I apologize, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Aha! Looks like the prosecution is just as unprepared as I am!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
There is a <textEffects>separate matter</textEffects>, however, that I would like to bring up during this trial.
</line><line>Judge:
A separate matter, you say? And what might that be?
</line><line>Payne:
I assume you are aware that another incident occurred during yesterday's trial? I'm speaking of course, of the assault on Mr. Justice in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh-oh. Why is he bringing THAT up?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, what a truly harrowing experience it must have been. Poor Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Payne:
At the time of the attack, Mr. Justice was not alone. He was with the defendant, Ms. Juniper Woods.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He isn't going where I think he's going with this... is he?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The prosecution wishes to indict Ms. Woods on the charge of <textEffects>Mr. Justice's assault</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne! The incident under deliberation here is the <textEffects>courtroom bombing</textEffects>! The assault on Mr. Justice has nothing to do with this trial.
</line><line>Payne:
Ah, but I believe there IS a connection between this case and <textEffects>Mr. Justice's assault</textEffects>. Please take a moment to consider these facts. Both events occurred in Courtroom No. 4. This is the location in Courtroom No.4 where the unconscious Mr. Justice was discovered. As you can see, it's quite close to where Detective Arme's body was found.
</line><line><textEffects>Courtroom No. 4 Diagram added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The question is, why did the culprit feel the need to maliciously attack Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Judge:
Why indeed... What do you believe their motive to be, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
I believe Mr. Justice found something in that courtroom while Ms. Woods was with him -- evidence that fingered her as the perpetrator of the bombing!
</line><line>Judge:
You mean he found some incriminating evidence?!
</line><line>Payne:
Precisely! And so, I surmise that the defendant picked up a piece of rubble and... ...hit Mr. Justice on the back of the head in order to silence him!

<line>Woods:
During the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...
Apollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.
But then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...
Apollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.
I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So Mr. Justice stayed by your side while you were feeling unwell...? What an admirable young man! I thought his loud voice was his only outstanding feature...

</line><line>Woods:
Something to do with the <textEffects>courtroom bombing</textEffects> kind of something, I think...
</line><line>Judge:

Just as I thought. There IS a connection between the two incidents. But the defendant has told a very big lie, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
What lie is that?

<textEffects>Apollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Woods:
<textEffects>Apollo started looking for Bum Rap Rhiny near the witness stand, where there was no rubble.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Woods:
<textEffects>But then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Woods:
<textEffects>Apollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Woods:
<textEffects>I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So he started his search with the witness stand, you say?
</line><line>Woods:
That's right. I guess maybe he wanted to start from the furthest point in the room. He was being so brave... *cough* and strong... *cough*
</line><line>Phoenix:
But that's odd... Under the circumstances, he shouldn't have been capable of that...
</line><line>Woods:
But he WAS! And he still IS! He might not look it, but he really IS brave! And kind, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, that's not the part I was finding fault with. <textEffects>(SOMEONE has a crush on Apollo...)</textEffects> What you are claiming is something that no one should have been able to do.
</line><line>Judge:
But I should think that anyone can be brave and kind if the wanted to be, Mr. Wright...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
True, anyone can be brave and kind, but if you would please take a look at this diagram. With the courtroom in this state, how was it possible to walk up to the witness stand?
</line><line>Woods:
Oh!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. I see your point. The rubble blocks off access to the area around the witness stand.
</line><line>Payne:
Hmph. Does such a tiny inconsistency even matter? Perhaps the witness is simply misremembering it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk. <textEffects>(Great, now I'M not so sure it matters...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
A real man doesn't make mountains out of mole hills, you know.
</line><line>Judge:
But that's precisely what Mr. Wright does best.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I call slander, Your Honor!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So, was it really impossible to approach the witness stand? I have to say, it's a bit hard to tell with any accuracy from just this diagram. Mr. Payne, do you have any other photos of the crime scene?
</line><line>Payne:
Er, let me see, Your Honor... Ah, yes. I have one more. Here it is. It's a more pulled-back version of the photo I presented before.
</line><line><textEffects>Apollo's Assault Photo updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Huh? What's that <span style="color:#E16935">hunk of metal on wheels</textEffects>?)</span> Mr. Payne, is the metallic object in that photo Mr. Tonate's <textEffects>bomb transport case</textEffects>?
</line><line>Payne:
That's right. Is there some problem?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, yes. That transport case was there in Courtroom No. 4 when the bomb went off. It must have been there ever since.
</line><line>Woods:
Oh! That's it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Woods? Have you remembered something?
</line><line>Woods:
Y-Yes! I just realized... Its position... It's different from before...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Its position? The position of what?
</line><line>Woods:
Um, the position of that big metal thing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>bomb transport case</textEffects>?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes. When Apollo and I went there, it was in a different place. Where the case is in the photo was open space, so it was easy to search the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see. So where was the transport case when you and Mr. Justice saw it?
</line><line>Woods:
As I recall, I think it was <textEffects>more to the right</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
To the right...? <textEffects>(Then that means...! In that case, the case was over there at the time of Apollo's attack...? Hmm...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Who cares where the transport case was when? What difference does it make? It has nothing at all to do with what we were talking ab--
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Where the transport case was has EVERYTHING to do with this discussion! In fact, it's so important that it's enough to turn the prosecution's argument on its ear!
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What...?!
</line><line>Judge:
Well! That certainly sounds very relevant indeed! And you sound as though you know where the case was at the time of the attack.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. This diagram represents the crime scene as shown in the photo. And this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault on Mr. Justice. <textEffects>(All right, I have this! The bomb transport case was here at the time of Apollo's attack!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!
</line><line>Judge:
But that's...!
</line><line>Payne:
...I-Inconceivable!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, was this where the transport case was when you saw it?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes... Yes, that's where it was!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Ms. Woods. I'm sure the court has noted an interesting fact about this position.
</line><line>Judge:
The transport case covers up the writing in blood!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly! If the transport case was in that position at the time of the assault... ...then no message could have been written there, because the case was in the way! Which leads us to conclude that Mr. Justice couldn't have left that bloody writing!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Why should we believe the defendant's claim that the case was in a different position?! She's obviously lying!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The fact that the case was moved after the assault on Mr. Justice... ...is proved by more than Ms. Woods's testimony alone!
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What?! And where is this "proof" you're talking about?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's right here in the crime photo.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I'm keen to see this proof, myself, Mr. Wright. <textEffects>What in this photo indicates that the transport case was moved after the assault?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!
</line><line>Judge:
I see it, but what is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This mark was made by one of the casters from the transport case carrying the bomb. As the case was moved, it ran over his bandages! In other words, the transport case was originally to the <textEffects>right</textEffects> of Mr. Justice! Then, after Mr. Justice was assaulted... ...the transport case was moved!
</line><line>Payne:
WHAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just as Ms. Woods said, the case was covering the writing at the time of the assault! Therefore, it was impossible for Mr. Justice to have left that message in blood!
</line><line>Payne:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Athena:
You did it, Boss! It was a real nail-biter, but you pulled it off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yup. That should bring down the prosecution's claim like a house of cards.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright, that was a very clever deduction.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aww, it was nothing, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Nothing but pure genius! Take THAT!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Boss! I'm sensing a definite "smug and braggy" vibe coming off of you...
</line><line>Payne:
Uuuuungh...
</line><line>Judge:
I have just one question, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
If Mr. Justice didn't leave this message in blood... ..then who did?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Athena:
What?
</line><line>Woods:
*cough*
</line><line>Payne:
............ Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Well... ............ <textEffects>(Looks like I should've taken that train of thought through to the last station...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Well, well. I've heard a lot about this. So this is Mr. Wright's famous bluffing technique, is it?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, this feeling! It brings back memories of the old days! Back when you carved out a name for yourself by bluffing your way through thick and thin!
</line><line>Athena:
Gee, Mr. Wright. The judge kind of makes you sound no better than a two-bit con man...
</line><line>Payne:
You made your argument with such confidence, Mr. Wright. Now I'd like to hear your answer with just as much confidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey, until the judge asked the question, you didn't catch on, either, buster!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What now, Boss?!
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh heh. I hope you didn't bluff your way into a corner.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Think, Phoenix, think! There must be a way through this! I have to dig my way to the truth somehow! Who could have written that message in blood?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If it wasn't Apollo, who could have left the bloody message?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(To be honest, I don't have any real proof of this... But I've come this far. There's no turning back now!)</textEffects> Besides Apollo, there was one more person who shed blood at this crime scene.
</line><line>Judge:
A person who shed blood...? You don't mean...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, but I do. I believe it was Candice Arme who left behind this message in blood.
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAT?!
</line><line>Athena:
What?! Detective Arme?! Are you sure you know what you're doing here?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, not really?
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
What kind of ridiculous assertion is that?! If you had said the attacker left the message to throw people off, it might've made sense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
At first glance, that would seem to be the most reasonable explanation. However... ...Apollo didn't shed enough blood to write such an extensive message.
</line><line>Payne:
Uh-oh...!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, I see. Even the photo makes it clear there wasn't enough blood to write all those letters. And Mr. Justice did survive. I suppose he didn't bleed very extensively, in that case.
</line><line>Payne:
But why would Detective Arme write the defendant's name? There is no connection between the two whatsoever!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woods:
A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
</line><line>Payne:
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Payne:
They had never even met each other!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's... very true...)</textEffects> Well, then, let's see... Then maybe the intended meaning of the message is not what it appears to be.
</line><line>Judge:
The "intended meaning"...?
</line><line>Woods:
"Not what it appears to be"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe the message was not intended to be "<textEffects>WOODS</textEffects>."
</line><line>Judge:
............ Coming from you, that's quite the bold statement, Mr. Wright. You wish to assert that this bloody writing could have some other meaning?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! <textEffects>(Hmm... For something I pulled out of a wormhole, it could turn out to be true, right?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Hmph! It clearly says "<textEffects>WOODS</textEffects>," as anyone can plainly see! What other meaning could it possibly have?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Candice Arme was a detective! Maybe "WOODS" only means something to the police. Like a police scanner code, for example.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I didn't think of that...
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh. You may have tricked His Honor, but you'll never get the best of me. I have a thing for studying on the weekends, as you may have already guessed. And there is no such radio code as "<textEffects>WOODS</textEffects>" in the state, dear Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-Is that a fact, heh heh...
</line><line>Athena:
Don't look at me. I know as much as you do about police codes.
</line><line>Judge:
Enough of this! I was quite taken with the defense's new theory... ...but if they can't substantiate it with anything, then I must end things here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! Please wait, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. But before we discuss this theory any further, I demand a plausible explanation. So, Mr. Wright, what is the <textEffects>true meaning</textEffects> of the bloody writing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... I believe it's...
</line><line>Judge:
And no stalling! If you can't come up with an answer quickly, I will declare this discussion officially over.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm in trouble now... What <span style="color:#E16935">other meaning</textEffects> could it have, besides the obvious one...? Maybe it means something in another language? Or maybe it's a <textEffects>code</textEffects>? Think, Phoenix! You can do this!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>Which piece of evidence will tell us what the word "WOODS" really means?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
The bomb transport case...? I've about had it up to here with your shenanigans, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a look at the numbers on this case, Your Honor. "<textEffects>L10015R</textEffects>". Doesn't this string look vaguely familiar?
</line><line>Judge:
"L100"... What does that have to do with anything?
</line><line>Payne:
Hmph. What could those numbers possibly have to do with the case at hand?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now please take a look at the bloody writing shown in the crime photo.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! I think I see it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Thatta girl! That one's on my side.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
It says "<textEffects>WOODS</textEffects>."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Or, you could say it's a horse of a different color, Your Honor. The first character isn't a "<textEffects>W</textEffects>". It's actually an "<textEffects>L</textEffects>" and a "<textEffects>1</textEffects>". The next two are zeros.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! My goodness!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The true meaning behind the bloody writing isn't Ms. Woods's name. It's the number engraved on this bomb transport case!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
What are you talking about?! The next part doesn't make any sense! The next number is a "<textEffects>1</textEffects>", but the bloody writing says "<textEffects>D</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But the number on the case and the bloody writing can be made to match up quite easily. <textEffects>This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Please erase the third, downward stroke of the "<textEffects>W</textEffects>", and the curved part of the "<textEffects>D</textEffects>."
</line><line>Judge:
Well! Would you look at that! ............ "<textEffects>LIOOIS</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, no, Your Honor! It isn't meant to be read as a word! It's the number "<textEffects>L-1-0-0-1-5</textEffects>"... ...which, if you take away the final "R"... ...is the exact same number that's one the bomb transport case!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Hmph! Erase two lines, and they match up, you say?! Well, I can change anything into anything else simply by erasing two lines! What if we erased two lines from your name?! Would you be happy as "Mr. Wrigh"?!
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Would you, Mr. Wrigh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only RIGHT spelling is "Wright!" <textEffects>(Okay, I'm doing pretty well here, and I think I've drawn the right conclusion. Detective Arme's real message to us is the bomb transport case number.)</textEffects> Your Honor, the two lines were added by the real culprit to intentionally mislead people!
</line><line>Payne:
WHAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The original message Detective Arme left behind was the transport case number! But whoever assaulted Apollo changed the message!
</line><line>Athena:
If you're right, Boss... ...then what do you suppose Detective Arme was trying to tell us?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Good question... What DOES this number represent...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Candice Arme lost her life in the courtroom bombing. Her dying message could only have had one purpose!
</line><line>Payne:
N-No!
</line><line>Phoenix:
To tell us the name of <textEffects>the one responsible for the bombing</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Don't keep us in suspense, Mr. Wright! Tell us who she was trying to name!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The culprit that the victim was trying to identify is none other than...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense wishes to indict <textEffects>Mr. Ted Tonate</textEffects> on the charge of the courtroom bombing!
</line><line>Judge:
T-Ted Tonate?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apparently, disabling bombs isn't Mr. Tonate's only specialty. Somehow, the victim must have realized that he was the bomber. So when she was caught in the blast... ...she left his bomb transport case number as her dying message. She used Mr. Tonate's own ID number to finger him for the crime!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Why would anyone go out of their way to write an ID number?! Wouldn't they simply write the person's name?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's got a good point there.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That only Detective Arme would know the answer to that, but allow me to offer a theory. Perhaps Detective Arme couldn't recall Mr. Tonate's name in the heat of the moment. As I recall, this was the first meeting between the two. It's entirely possible they wouldn't have been familiar with each other.
</line><line>Athena:
Or maybe using the ID number was a way to hide its true meaning from the real culprit! Thus lowering the odds that they would erase the bloody writing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But no matter what the reason, the important thing is the meaning behind her message. The fact remains, she wrote Mr. Tonate's ID number!

</line><line>Payne:
Now, just one moment, here! There hasn't been any proof yet that it was indeed Detective Arme who wrote it! The bloody writing wasn't found during the investigation after the blast! If Detective Arme had left the message, it should have been found at that time!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Naturally Mr. Tonate hid it before anyone could discover it. And there's a simple explanation for how he was able to do so.
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The first person to discover the bloody writing was Mr. Tonate himself.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
When Mr. Tonate saw that the victim had written his ID number... ...he used his bomb transport case to cover up the bloody writing as a stopgap measure.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, so that's why the message in blood was under the transport case!
</line><line>Phoenix:
He didn't have enough time to try and scrub away the writing. If he didn't report the body right away, he would look suspicious. So those letters lived on to serve another function... ...when Mr. Tonate used them in another incident!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! The assault on Mr. Justice!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. Mr. Tonate hit upon a plan to use the bloody writing for his own purposes. So he didn't clean it away. Instead, he made it look like Mr. Justice wrote it. By adding two lines to the writing that Detective Arme left behind... ...he changed the meaning of the message! He made it look like Mr. Justice was accusing Ms. Woods of the attack!
</line><line>Athena:
So that means...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only person who could have altered the bloody writing was the courtroom bomber... ...who was the same person that assaulted Mr. Justice. And that person is Ted Tonate!
</line><line>Payne:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order in the court! Order, I say! It looks like we will have to hear from the bomb specialist himself. Mr. Payne, please have Mr. Tonate take the witness stand!
</line><line>Payne:
Ungh... Yes, Your Honor...
</line><line>Athena:
That was great, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just doing what I do best! <textEffects>(Which is flying by the seat of my pants...)</textEffects>

<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>DISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've finally drawn Mr. Tonate back onto the witness stand. Looks like you'll get your wish, goggle-man. Now watch me take your lies apart!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Tonate:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Tonate, I'm afraid we have a few more questions for you.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, YOUR HONOR. I WAS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE GALLERY. THE ALLEGATIONS ARE ALL LAUGHABLE.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't be laughing if I were you, Mr. Tonate. The message in blood matches your ID number! The same ID number that is there on that <textEffects>bomb transport case</textEffects>!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>SUCH A FARFETCHED THEORY! NO BETTER THAN A TANGLED BALL OF WIRES.</textEffects> I've <i>[sic]</i> have them untangled for you in no time at all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were the first person on the scene after Detective Arme left her message in blood. You were the only one who could've hidden the writing, and then used it again later!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I SEE x2. BUT THEN, LET ME ASK YOU: DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF THAT DETECTIVE ARME WROTE THAT MESSAGE?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
That's a very good question. Well, do you, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The best way to prove that Detective Arme wrote that message is to...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I request that a DNA test be performed on the blood itself. Once we know whose it is, it will be obvious as to who wrote the message!
</line><line>Tonate:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Please put in a request for a DNA test with the forensics team!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Yes, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
It will be some time before we have the results of the analysis. Until then, let's hear more from the witness.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE, YOUR HONOR. I WANT THE COURT TO HEAR HOW RIDICULOUS THE DEFENSE'S THEORY IS.</textEffects>

</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>PRECISELY. IT IS AS PLAIN AS DAY THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN IT.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
It's true that the body was discovered near the entrance to the courtroom. Please have a look at this crime scene photo. As you can see, there is blood on the rubble near the victim's body. She must've died after hitting her head there.

Hmm... The victim's body and the writing ARE several yards away from each other. There's no way she could reach.
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>Quite the conundrum.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
So that means something is off somewhere. There must be a contradiction.
</line><line>Athena:
Ah! Maybe the <textEffects>body was moved</textEffects>? But that doesn't explain how blood got onto the rubble...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What if that was done by the real culprit <span style="color:#E16935">after the fact</textEffects>? If that's the case, then something about that should contradict the evidence we have.)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You are a terrible liar, Mr. Tonate.
</line><line>Tonate:
............???
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a look at this autopsy -- specifically, the part about Detective Arme's head injury. "Cause of death: Trauma to back of head caused by impact with a flat object."
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YES? WHAT ABOUT IT?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now take a good look at the bloody piece of rubble. It's sharp and pointed!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>ND$OIJH AJ9LS WO&amp;J09 BDSK ^(*&amp;!</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
H-Hey, you're right, Boss! It IS pointy! Just like your hair!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That is odd, isn't it? What could be the meaning of this contradiction?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe it means the victim did not hit her head on this piece of rubble. The bloodstain you see is just another fabrication. Its purpose is to mislead us into thinking the victim died near the courtroom entrance!
</line><line>Payne:
A-Are you claiming the culprit moved the victim's body?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm claiming. The victim hit her head at some location. Most likely on the floor, or some other flat surface. And this location was somewhere near where the bloody writing was found.
</line><line>Athena:
In that case, she definitely could have written the message!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Your Honor! I have the results of the bloodstain analysis!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, very good timing. Let's take a look. Hmm... According to this report, the message was written in Detective Arme's blood. And, as the defense claims, only the parts of the message that were added afterwards... ...were written in Mr. Justice's blood. It would appear that the defense's assertion is correct after all.

</line><line>Payne:
What on Earth are you babbling about now? Wasn't it you who claimed that the bloody writing was his ID number in the first place?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a good look at the photo in the bloody writing analysis. Now tell me, does it really say "<textEffects>L10015R</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Tonate:
Oh!
</line><line>Payne:
Eep!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Something is missing, isn't it? And that "something" is the final "<textEffects>R</textEffects>."

............ <textEffects>O-OH! OH, RIGHT! NOW I REMEMBER. THERE WAS NO "<span style="color:#E16935">R</textEffects>" ON THE END. I-IT WAS JUST A SLIP OF THE FINGER. MY BAD.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(C-Come back, my beautiful contradiction...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright, I'm not so sure it was just a simple slip of the finger...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have something for me, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
I sense that he's extremely agitated, almost panicked...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... He does look pretty flustered...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright, it appears it was nothing more than a mere mistake.

<textEffects>(I don't know... Did he really just make a typo? What about that "<span style="color:#E16935">R</textEffects>"? Did Mr. Tonate actually see it?)</span>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maybe Mr. Tonate really did see the "<span style="color:#E16935">R</textEffects>"... But there's no "R" anywhere in the bloody writing. What's going on here? Huh? Now that I take another good look at the photo, I think maybe...)</span> THAT'S IT!!!
</line><line>Athena:
What is it now, Mr. Wright?! Are you trying to imitate Apollo and his "Chords of Steel"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got it! So that's what happened!)</textEffects> "A slip of the finger." Is that really all it was? Because I don't think so. I propose that Mr. Tonate really DID see the letter "<textEffects>R</textEffects>."
</line><line>Tonate:
!
</line><line>Judge:
But... ...the photo clearly shows that there is no "<textEffects>R</textEffects>"...
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. Actually, just the opposite is true. The photo shows that Mr. Tonate actually could have seen the "<textEffects>R</textEffects>."

If you're going to make that claim, then you'd better be able to point out what you mean! <textEffects>What part of the photo shows that Mr. Tonate could have seen the "R"?</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Please look here, to the right of the "<textEffects>5</textEffects>." Do you see a little bit of red?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, I see it! Just on the edge of where the floor is broken up!

That's the "<textEffects>R</textEffects>" that Mr. Tonate saw.

</line><line>Phoenix:
But what Mr. Tonate saw wasn't that little smudge. There was a whole and complete "<textEffects>R</textEffects>" written there... ...before the floor was damaged by the explosion!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, well, that explains it-- Huh?
</line><line>Athena:
Care to explain what you mean...? Because you just proposed that everything happened in the exact opposite order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yup, because that's the way it really went down. <textEffects>(The timing of when the "<span style="color:#E16935">R</textEffects>" was written turns everything about this case around!)</span> <textEffects>Now then, if the floor was damaged by the explosion, when was the message written?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
With the bloody message running off the edge of the damaged floor like that... ...we can only conclude that it was written BEFORE the explosion!
</line><line>Payne:
B-But that's ridiculous!
</line><line>Judge:
If that were true, it overturns your own premise!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. It does. In fact, it turns everything upside-down! The victim was not killed by the explosion in the courtroom! She was killed before the explosion ever occurred!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
</line><line>Payne:
What kind of preposterous claim is that?! Have you forgotten that the victim's body was found at the scene of the explosion?!

</line><line>Phoenix:
True, but consider this scenario. She was hit on the head and killed before the explosion -- or even before the trial began. Her body was subsequently placed in the courtroom ruins after the bombing occurred. That way, it could be made to look like she was a victim of the blast!
</line><line>Payne:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Judge:
It sounds like we had better look into what the victim was doing before the trial. Mr. Payne, did anyone see Detective Arme before the trial?
</line><line>Payne:
Let's see... According to the police report... ...Ah, here it is! One person! One person saw the victim before the trial! And that person was... Ted Tonate... Wait, what?!
</line><line>Judge:
N-No one besides Mr. Tonate saw the victim?!
</line><line>Payne:
Th-That appears to be the case, Your Honor.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>............</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would now ask the court to recall something... Specifically, Mr. Tonate's words from yesterday!

</line><line>Payne:
Tsk, tsk. Do you always leave yourself so open to attacks, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What now, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
Yes, Mr. Tonate may have had the opportunity to kill Detective Arme. But an important piece of your assertion is missing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What important piece?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
The <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>! What do you claim was used to kill the victim?!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Payne has a point! Even if Mr. Tonate had the chance, without a weapon, we can't accuse him of the crime.
</line><line>Payne:
Well, Mr. Tonate?
</line><line>Tonate:
Oh, uh, yes! That's right! I didn't have any sort of thing that could be used as a murder weapon on me. I couldn't possibly have killed Detective Arme!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Did he really have nothing he could use as a murder weapon?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm. Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Just looking over the victim's autopsy report. I'm hoping there's something in here that can point us in the right direction.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it does say that she died from <textEffects>trauma to the back of the head with a flat object</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, and to inflict that specific kind of injury... ...all you would need is a flat surface, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A heavy, blunt object with a flat surface could definitely be our murder weapon.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you indicate for the court what was used to kill Detective Arme?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I believe I can. <textEffects>("Believe" being the key word here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
Y-You can?!
</line><line>Judge:
Then please do so now! <textEffects>What did Mr. Tonate have that could have been used as the murder weapon?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate, you say you didn't have anything that could be used as a weapon. But in fact, you had the perfect thing.
</line><line>Tonate:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! What the devil are you talking about?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You had this.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's the bomb. I thought you were trying to prove that the victim wasn't killed by the bomb blast.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bomb blast, no. But I believe Candice Arme WAS killed with this bomb. Because this is the <textEffects>blunt object</textEffects> that delivered the fatal blow to her head!
</line><line>Tonate:
Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please recall the description of Detective Arme's head wound. "Trauma to back of head caused by impact with a flat object." We assumed this injury was sustained when her head hit the floor... ...but a blow from any flat side of this bomb would produce the exact same wound pattern!
</line><line>Tonate:
Uuugh! Gaaagh............ Ungh............ Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What's with him...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
Then show me some proof! Where's the evidence that I hit the victim with the bomb?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ack! He's right. I don't have anything decisive...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
Did you find any of the victim's blood on the bomb? That would be decisive proof. But too bad! The bomb is blown to bits! It's long gone! Boom! Game over! Yeaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! Is there really nothing on the bomb in the photo?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Argh! I don't see any blood or anything...
</line><line>Athena:
Wait! The <textEffects>timer display is a little broken</textEffects> here! Maybe it broke when it made contact with Detective Arme's head!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's definitely a distinct possibility. But unless we find a fragment with the victim's blood on it, it's not going to count.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh... I guess you're right...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(By setting off the bomb, Tonate managed to obliterate all traces of the murder weapon. What in the world do I do now? At times like this, I've got to change gears and <span style="color:#E16935">look at things in a different way</textEffects>! Instead of looking for the things he <textEffects>wasn't able to hide</textEffects>... ...I should be looking for a way to expose the <textEffects>things he DID hide</textEffects>. Ted Tonate murdered Detective Arme <textEffects>before the trial started</textEffects>... Then he placed her body in the courtroom <textEffects>after the bomb went off.</textEffects> Which means there was something he needed to keep hidden until then. And I think I have just the thing. Time to present the photo that shows exactly what Mr. Tonate had to hide!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! There's something we've all been overlooking! If the murder took place before the trial... ...then Mr. Tonate would've had to hide the body somewhere during the trial!
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, you're right! And if we can figure out where that hiding place was...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. We might be able to find some evidence we can pin him down with! <textEffects>So where could Mr. Tonate have hidden the body during the trial?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait... A box big enough for a body, a box that was in the courtroom the whole time... A box nobody would touch if they thought there was a bomb in it!)</textEffects> Mr. Tonate!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WHAT IS IT? DO YOU FINALLY HAVE SOME DECISIVE EVIDENCE TO SHOW ME?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, you're the one who's going to show it to me.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>COME AGAIN?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
You heard me. Now, show me what's inside that <textEffects>bomb transport case</textEffects>!
</line><line>Tonate:
What?! Why?! No! There's no need!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got him now!)</textEffects> Just before the trial, you killed the victim with a blunt object. And then, you placed her body in the ruins of the courtroom after the bomb went off. Clearly, you were trying to make it look like she died in the explosion. But where was the body hidden during the trial?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! I hadn't thought of that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The answer is right here! Inside a box made of thick alloy plating that can withstand any impact!
</line><line>Tonate:
Um, no! That's, er, completely false!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If it's false, you should have no objections to showing us your transport case. So! Let's open it up and take a look inside, shall we?!
</line><line>Tonate:

</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>............ LET'S NOT. NOT IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What's he up to now?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>REMAIN CALM AND LISTEN CAREFULLY. THIS BOMB WILL DETONATE IN FIVE MINUTES.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I REPEAT, THIS HH-3000 WILL DETONATE IN FIVE MINUTES.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's going on?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YOUR HONOR, I RECOMMEND YOU ADJOURN THIS TRIAL... ...BEFORE THIS BOMB GOES OFF.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Tonate! Are you... Are you threatening me?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>HEH HEH HEH. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DISABLE THIS BOMB. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO DIE, YOUR ONLY OPTION IS TO LISTEN TO ME.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
But Mr. Tonate! Didn't you say that's just a training model? A fake to practice on?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I DID, BUT I ALSO LIED. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. THIS IS THE HH-3000.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But the HH-3000 was used to blow up Courtroom No. 4... wasn't it?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS THE REAL HH-3000 THAT BLEW UP COURTROOM NO. 4?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>THE BOMB THAT BLEW UP THE COURTROOM WAS A DIFFERENT ONE, ONE THAT I MADE.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Then, are we to take that as a confession on your part?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>TAKE IT ANY WAY YOU WOULD LIKE. JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL... ...I TOOK THE HH-3000 OUT OF THE STUFFED ANIMAL AND PUT MY OWN BOMB INTO IT. THAT WAS THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED AND DESTROYED COURTROOM NO. 4.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
M-Mr. Tonate, please be reasonable! Do you really expect us to believe a crazy story like that?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>THE HH-3000... IT IS SO UNIQUE! I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT IS SO UNIQUE THAT I COULD NOT REPLICATE THE DETONATION MECHANISM. SO... I JUST HAD TO HAVE IT. BESIDES, DID ANYONE LOOK INSIDE THE STUFFED ANIMAL DURING THE TRIAL? DID ANYONE CHECK TO SEE IF IT REALLY WAS THE HH-3000 IN THERE?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
! I-I must confess, no one opened up the stuffed animal to check...
</line><line>Payne:
S-So there really is a possibility that the bomb was switched out?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>NO, NOT A POSSIBILITY. A CERTAINTY. I DID IT.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So he's had a real bomb with him this whole time?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YOU HAD BETTER GET OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU CAN. YOU DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
</line><line>Man:
I-I'm outta here!!! It's gonna blow! RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YOU FOUR ARE STILL HERE? WELL, WELL. AREN'T YOU BRAVE?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I-I-It just wouldn't do for the judge presiding over this court to run... ...but that horrible explosion the other day...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The judge looks like he's about to book it for the nearest exit any second... And Mr. Payne...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
I-I-I-I-I... That is... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And he's off...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! Wh-What do we do?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh... It'd be pretty pathetic to run now, wouldn't it.
</line><line>Athena:
B-B-But the bomb might really go off...!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>ONLY THREE MORE MINUTES, FOLKS.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that bomb really the HH-3000? What should I do?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't run now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>WELL, IT'S BEEN FUN, BUT I WILL BE GOING NOW. WITH MY DEAR, DEAR HH-3000, NATURALLY. OH, AND BY THE WAY. I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST HAVING ME FOLLOWED. EVEN WITH NO REMOTE SWITCH, THIS BOMB CAN STILL BE TRIGGERED MANUALLY. IF I THINK I'M BEING FOLLOWED, I WILL DETONATE IT ON THE SPOT. FAREWELL.</textEffects>

</line><line>Phoenix:
You're not going anywhere, Ted Tonate!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>OH?!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, there's no reason to be afraid! That bomb is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Tonate:
!
</line><line>Judge:
A-Are you sure, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>............HMPH. MORE OF YOUR FAMOUS BLUFFING? EVEN AT THE RISK OF YOUR OWN LIFE?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
M-M-M-Mr. Wright! None of your bluffing now! Not at a time like this! Lives are on the line, here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not bluffing. And I have proof!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, of course, Your Honor. It's right here in the photo of the bomb, clear as day. Proof that Mr. Tonate's bomb is not the real HH-3000!
</line><line>Judge:
Really?! Out with it, then! Immediately! <textEffects>Where is the proof that what Mr. Tonate is holding is not the real HH-3000?!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The display for the timer on the bomb in the photo is broken. Most likely, it broke when Mr. Tonate used the bomb to attack Detective Arme. But the display on the bomb in front of us is not broken.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! You're right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, this is not the real HH-3000. Mr. Tonate was clearly lying when he said he switched out the bomb in the stuffed animal! The real HH-3000 blew up in Courtroom No. 4! This bomb is nothing more than a fake, a model used for training purposes!
</line><line>Tonate:
GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Fear not, Your Honor! I will examine the inside of the bomb transport case myself!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, please do that, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Tonate:
NO! STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is that...? I-Is that a bloodstain?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just as I expected. Your lies have all been blown to bits, Mr. Tonate! I'm confident DNA analysis on this bloodstain will confirm that it's Detective Arme's blood. And that those results will conclusively prove that you murdered Detective Arme!
</line><line>Tonate:
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuungh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
How about it, Mr. Tonate? Think you can dismantle this conclusive evidence?!
</line><line>Tonate:
............Dismantle it? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You're too late! You missed your chance to run, so now you're out of time! This HH-3000, is about to explode!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't try to threaten us, Mr. Tonate. I've already proved that your "bomb" is a fake.
</line><line>Tonate:
It's real! This bomb is the real thing, I tell you! It's real... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mad Bomber, party of one.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
There's no time left! It's going to blow! I have to disarm it! I have to take it apart! I can dismantle anything! I can take apart evidence! I can take apart bombs! I can dismantle it all! DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!

<line>Tonate:
Ha ha ha! It's all over! My life has been blown to pieces! It's all that stupid woman's fault! I was selling the bombs I disarmed on the black market. When I tried to take this one, she just had to notice, didn't she?! She confronted me in Courtroom No. 4 that day. That's why... That's why I had no choice! Before I knew what I was doing, I hit her... It's all her fault! While I was looking for a place to hide her body, she left a message in her own blood! The trial was about to start, so I didn't have time to clean it up. And now all this...! I thought for sure I could disguise her death with an explosion! Then that stupid defense attorney started sticking his nose into my business! After my testimony yesterday, I went to Courtroom No. 4 and... I found that kid all up in my bomb transport case! That's when I snuck up behind him and ...BAM! And when the idiot police arrested that little girl... ...I thought for sure I could pin it all on her! Why... oh, why...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Ted Tonate, you are hereby under arrest... ...on suspicion of the courtroom bombing and the assault on Mr. Justice. Your innocence or guilt will be determined at a later trial. Now then, I see that members of the public have returned to the gallery. One person, however, seems to still be running far, far away... Be that as it may... ...I will now announce Ms. Juniper Woods's verdict.

You did it, Boss!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess we managed to pull it off somehow.
</line><line>Athena:
So many mysteries cleared up all at once! It was amazing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It just sort of worked out that way, didn't it.
</line><line>Athena:
That's not the kind of thing that usually just "works out"" You made it happen! And the way that mean ol' prosecutor high-tailed it out of here! That was great!
</line><line>Woods:
Mr. Wright, Thena, thank you for everything you did for me!
</line><line>Athena:
I'm so happy for you, Junie! Now you can go back home to the forest in peace!
</line><line>Woods:
I hope the both of you will come and visit me there sometime.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That would be nice. Thank you for the invitation.
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... I dunno, Mr. Wright... I'm not so sure you could make it all the way up to Junie's house. How high up do you live again, Junie?
</line><line>Woods:
Umm... Around 3,000 feet, I think.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! <textEffects>(That's no forest -- that's a mountain!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
But, you know, Boss... ...there's something that still bothers me about the case. One little mystery we never got around to solving.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, that? Yeah, I was wondering about that, too... <textEffects>Is this the unsolved mystery you're thinking of?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
Maybe Mr. Tonate just got rid of it somewhere...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah... It is a pretty big thing to leave unsolved, though...)</textEffects> Well, let's leave it up to the police to find. For now, we should be celebrating our not guilty verdict.
</line><line>Athena:
I guess you're right! Hey, I know! Junie, shall we go report the good news? You know, to that certain someone...?
</line><line>Woods:
...Okay.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Her grandmother?
</line><line>Athena:
No, silly! To Apollo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right. Well, why don't we all go to the hospital together to see him!

Great idea! I bet he's bored out of his mind.

Okay!

<line>Phoenix:
And so, the courtroom bombing case came to a close. But the next trial was just over the horizon. There's never a dull moment with so many lawyers in the office. That's for sure. Apollo Justice, Athena Cykes, and me, Phoenix Wright. Between the three of us, there's no case we can't solve! When our powers combine, we're an unstoppable team. ...At least, that's what I believed. But all of that changed with what Apollo said to us that day. It was something that would put my faith in us to the ultimate test.
