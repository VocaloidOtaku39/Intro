Byrde:
Oh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!
</line><line>???:
Maggey!
</line><line>Byrde:
Ack! D-Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?
</line><line>Byrde:
...As if you need to ask either question, sir.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?
</line><line>Byrde:
Roger!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I-I think he's serious!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yup.
</line><line>Maya:
So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?
</line><line>Byrde:
Really? Can you, sir!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-Sure.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?
</line><line>Byrde:
I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.
</line><line>Maya:
Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can only wish...)</textEffects>

District CourtCourtroom No. 4</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Godot:
... Aaah, bitter!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr... Um... Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Aaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong!?
</line><line>Judge:
Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... "Youse talkin' to me!?" It was a little, well... intimidating.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Our trusty"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.
</line><line>Godot:
Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Godot:
I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who <span style="color:#E16935">really hates me</textEffects> for some reason or another!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Godot:
Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! State your name for the court!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.
</line><line>Godot:
Other way around, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
Since yesterday?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.
</line><line>Maya:
I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts this into evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.
</line><line>Judge:
The waitress being the <textEffects>accused</textEffects>?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.
</line><line><textEffects>Tr√©s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm... Yes, sir...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Incident --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.
We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.
Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.
And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!
And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Godot:
Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!
</line><line>Judge:
The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I already told you! That wasn't me!

<line>Maya:
You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
To be honest, I don't know.
</line><line>Maya:
But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather <span style="color:#E16935">the facts</textEffects> together, I guess.)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>After fully pressing first, third and fifth statements:</i>
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.
</line><line>Godot:
I like an old man who knows the score.
</line><line>Judge:
There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!
</line><line>Godot:
I don't like an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.
</line><line>Maya:
Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.
</line><line>Godot:
I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That stain looks like...! <textEffects>(It can't be... <span style="color:#E16935">blood</textEffects>, can it!?)</span>
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...
</line><line>Godot:
Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.
</line><line>Judge:
Something else? I presume you mean...
</line><line>Godot:
Of course. I'm referring to the pocket.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The... pocket?
</line><line>Godot:
A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... <textEffects>Potassium cyanide</textEffects>. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAT!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Apron added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the <textEffects>bloodstain</textEffects> to the court?
</line><line>Godot:
<textEffects>Bloodstain</textEffects>? What bloodstain would that be?
</line><line>Judge:
Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!
</line><line>Godot:
That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
N-No way, sir! That's... It's just <textEffects>ketchup</textEffects>. Sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ketchup!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.
</line><line>Judge:
... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Godot:
Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
The <textEffects>motive</textEffects>, the <textEffects>opportunity</textEffects>, and the supporting <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>... They have all been clearly established.
</line><line>Godot:
Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Investigation --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
The victim didn't have any identification on him.
But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.
</line><line>Godot:
Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Godot:
Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!

<line>Phoenix:
If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!
</line><line>Maya:
Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.
</line><line>Maya:
Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You testified that, "nothing else was missing from the crime scene." However! The prescription bag you mentioned was <textEffects>empty</textEffects>! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um, no. They didn't.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr√©s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!
</line><line>Judge:
I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim was killed by <textEffects>poison</textEffects>! And the victim's "<textEffects>medicine</textEffects>" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! That's all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Godot:
Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? "New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic" O-Otolaryngological?
</line><line>Judge:
Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?
</line><line>Godot:
Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.
</line><line>Judge:
A war wound?
</line><line>Godot:
The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and <textEffects>ruptured his eardrum</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He ruptured his eardrum!?
</line><line>Judge:
Then what on earth was the <textEffects>prescription</textEffects> he was given?
</line><line>Godot:
It was a cream that was to be <textEffects>applied topically</textEffects> inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Godot:
It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.
</line><line>Godot:
It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr√©s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uuurgh...
</line><line>Judge:
It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No...
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. "It seems Mr. Elg correctly <textEffects>applied</textEffects> some of his medication while he was at Tr√©s Bien." If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?
</line><line>Godot:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!
</line><line>Godot:
Aaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?
</line><line>Godot:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Godot...?
</line><line>Godot:
...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at beat. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.
</line><line>Maya:
Yay! Good job, Nick!
</line><line>Judge:
The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.
</line><line>Judge:
Court is adjourned for recess!

</line><line>Byrde:
That's my line, sir!
</line><line>Maya:
No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.
</line><line>Byrde:
Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Byrde:
He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?
</line><line>Byrde:
It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Poor Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!
</line><line>Byrde:
I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?

Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!

Judge:
Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.
</line><line>Godot:
The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Godot:
Name and occupation, if you don't mind.
</line><line>Kudo:
The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.
</line><line>Kudo:
My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Kimono embroidery?
</line><line>Kudo:
That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!
</line><line>Maya:
Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.
</line><line>Kudo:
Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?
</line><line>Kudo:
Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.
</line><line>Judge:
Seeds?
</line><line>Kudo:
What do you think these are, hmm!?
</line><line>Judge:
I-I see...
</line><line>Godot:
So you saw everything that happened, gramps?
</line><line>Kudo:
Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!
</line><line>Godot:
Then please, tell the court. We're all ears.
</line><line>Kudo:
Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!

<line>Kudo:
The young man was reading the sports paper.
The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!
The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.
That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!

<line>Judge:
Mr. Kudo. she is not a "serving girl". Please refer to her as a waitress.
</line><line>Kudo:
Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?
</line><line>Judge:
N-Newfangled?
</line><line>Kudo:
All this talk of "radios" and "glasses"! It's "wireless" and "spectacles", I tell you!
</line><line>Judge:
E-Excuse me...
</line><line>Kudo:
Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor.

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>The young man was reading the sports paper.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.</textEffects>
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Maya:
Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.
</line><line>Maya:
But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I guess... <textEffects>(Hmm, she makes a good point though...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! Did I just say something clever?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw <textEffects>really was Maggey</textEffects>...
</line><line>Maya:
That's what we have to figure out, Nick!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.
</line><line>Kudo:
Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Have you ever seen this before?
</line><line>Kudo:
Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line>
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Kudo:
Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, "you half-witted clot", there's been an eerie silence in here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the <textEffects>defendant</textEffects> on the day of the poisoning!
</line><line>Kudo:
Uh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...
</line><line>Kudo:
Er...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You <textEffects>couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kudo:
... Oops!
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! You can't just "oops" your way out of this!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Godot:
Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was <textEffects>only one waitress</textEffects> in the restaurant.
</line><line>Judge:
That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?
</line><line>Godot:
Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.
</line><line>Godot:
Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.
</line><line>Kudo:
You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!
</line><line>Maya:
He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- About the Victim --</textEffects></center>
<line>Kudo:
He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.
He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!
The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.
Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.
The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.
</line><line>Kudo:
Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!
</line><line>Maya:
How are we going to handle this, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.
</line><line>Maya:
Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
I guess we just need to find a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> in his testimony somewhere, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?
</line><line>Kudo:
I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!
</line><line>Godot:
Care to tell us where this is going, Trite?
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his <textEffects>left</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kudo:
Kah! What is this? Kindergarten?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I would like the court to please take a look at this.
</line><line>Judge:
That's the cup victim used, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the <textEffects>mark left by the victim's lips</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his <textEffects>right hand</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kudo:
But how...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!
</line><line>Kudo:
Aaaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.
</line><line>Kudo:
WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You still insist on your testimony?
</line><line>Kudo:
That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who, me!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.
</line><line>Kudo:
Don't call me "old man", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...
</line><line>Godot:
Sure, why not hear a little more?
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Godot!
</line><line>Godot:
But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.
</line><line>Kudo:
Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Left Hand or Right Hand --</textEffects></center>
<line>Kudo:
The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.
He kept fiddling with it all the time.
He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.
And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.
</line><line>Godot:
It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.
</line><line>Judge:
A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?
</line><line>Godot:
The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.
</line><line>Kudo:
HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kudo:
And those are the facts, in good old black and white!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Left Hand or Right Hand --</textEffects></center>
<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>He kept fiddling with it all the time.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kudo:
<textEffects>And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Maya:
Well, Nick? What do you think?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.
</line><line>Maya:
Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any <span style="color:#E16935">contradictions</textEffects> in his testimony, right?)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.
</line><line>Kudo:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.
</line><line>Kudo:
No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't think so.
</line><line>Kudo:
Wh-What did you say!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!
</line><line>Kudo:
Eh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!
</line><line>Kudo:
... Is that true, Captain?
</line><line>Godot:
...It is.
</line><line>Kudo:
...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?
</line><line>Godot:
Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!
</line><line>Kudo:
Captain! Are you calling me a drip!?
</line><line>Judge:
This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his <textEffects>right hand</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kudo:
I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his <textEffects>left hand</textEffects>!
</line><line>Godot:
Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!
</line><line>Godot:
Puuuurgh!
</line><line>Judge:
I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!
</line><line>Kudo:
D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!

</line><line>Kudo:
WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?
</line><line>Judge:
Leave you, Mr. Kudo?
</line><line>Kudo:
Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How is your bad memory my fault!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.
</line><line>Kudo:
I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!
</line><line>Godot:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's more?
</line><line>Kudo:
To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Me? <textEffects>(He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kudo:
Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!
</line><line>Godot:
Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.
</line><line>Kudo:
What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial. I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.
</line><line>Kudo:
You bet! Much, much quicker!
</line><line>Maya:
I can't believe this is happening...
</line><line>Kudo:
Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? <textEffects>(He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- The Final Showdown --</textEffects></center>
<line>Kudo:
First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.
The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...
Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.
It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!
Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
... Um... Is that all?
</line><line>Kudo:
Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?
</line><line>Judge:
N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.
</line><line>Maya:
Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. "So what?" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!
</line><line>Kudo:
You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.

He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.
</line><line>Maya:
It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, "I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!"
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.
</line><line>Kudo:
Hmph! So what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact!
</line><line>Kudo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Lost your tongue, granddad?
</line><line>Kudo:
... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ow! Oooow!
</line><line>Judge:
Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night.
</line><line>Kudo:
Aaaaaah!
</line><line>Judge:
... What is it now?
</line><line>Kudo:
I just remembered something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes...? Go on...
</line><line>Kudo:
The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wha...?
</line><line>Kudo:
Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my <textEffects>table</textEffects>, I mean.
</line><line>Judge:
The vase on your table?
</line><line>Kudo:
Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked.

<hr />
<line>Judge:
*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.
</line><line>Kudo:
Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.
</line><line>Kudo:
Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!
</line><line>Kudo:
WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are <textEffects>two</textEffects> disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his <textEffects>left hand</textEffects>. And the earpiece which was inserted into his <textEffects>left ear</textEffects>, out of which he couldn't hear.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow, Nick! You did it!
</line><line>Judge:
I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Godot:
...
</line><line>Judge:
There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-One more thing, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... OK...
</line><line>Judge:
You may each have a copy of it, if you wish.
</line><line>Godot:
Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.
</line><line>Maya:
Godot's really mad, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. I would be, too.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line><textEffects>Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("I'm sorry"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...)</textEffects>

That is all. This court is adjourned!
