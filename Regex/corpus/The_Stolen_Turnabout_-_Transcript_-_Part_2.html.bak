Maya:
Hey, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it? Is something wrong...?
</line><line>Maya:
Nah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You bought that...? Where!?
</line><line>Pearl:
From the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!
</line><line>Maya:
You know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!
</line><line><textEffects>Mask☆DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck onto the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Come on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!
</line><line>Pearl:
...Who's screaming like that?
</line><line>Ron:
...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you.
</line><line>Ron:
Because I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!
</line><line>Maya:
Ungh... He's at it again.
</line><line>Ron:
I sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?
</line><line>Ron:
Well, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Normally, when I say "Of course you didn't" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
Anyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?
</line><line>Desirée:
Oh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!
</line><line>Ron:
Oh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you a<textEffects>t a time like this</textEffects>
</line><line>Desirée:
Leave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!
</line><line>Ron:
Ummm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually <textEffects>the thief is err, me</textEffects>
</line><line>Desirée:
Can I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So, why are you smiling when you say it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Desirée:
Well, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask☆DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Bailiff:
Mr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desirée...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>October 13, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 6</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your honor.
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Judge:
What about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...
</line><line>???:
...What a stupid question!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What did you say!
</line><line>???:
Fine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.
</line><line>???:
Well, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.
</line><line>Judge:
...Um, wh-who are you?
</line><line>Godot:
I am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! None.
</line><line>Judge:
What did you say...?
</line><line>Godot:
I've never prosecuted a case before.
</line><line>Judge:
N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.
</line><line>Godot:
...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.
</line><line>Judge:
Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?
</line><line>Godot:
Even the mightiest of Redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the "real deal"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No. I don't have any friends that call me "Trite". <textEffects>(Just who is this masked man...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.
</line><line>Godot:
It's not "Gobo". It's Godot... Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
In any case, please give your opening statement.
</line><line>Godot:
Opening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
</line><line>Godot:
Are you familiar with the saying, "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Um, my name is...
</line><line>Godot:
No one asked for your name, witness.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Urk.
</line><line>Godot:
The important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
Alright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 month years ago.
He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!
This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.
His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.
That's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! Y-You! W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!
</line><line>Godot:
Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. It's only coffee, after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, Nick? What are you going to do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
As long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it <textEffects>wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>

</line>


<line>Maya:
Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Maya:
But... But...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.
</line><line>Maya:
So even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Just hearing the "little" in that question is making me nervous.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You said that he always "goes after the most precious art pieces", right?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right, pal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly "priceless" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of "precious art"!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean!?
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?
</line><line>Godot:
The appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So in other words... It was <textEffects>not the kind of item</textEffects> that Mask☆DeMasque would <textEffects>normally go after</textEffects>!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Urk!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was <textEffects>not the work of Mask☆DeMasque</textEffects>...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes... That's what I'm saying. <textEffects>(Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?
</line><line>Godot:
This coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Godot:
If you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.
</line><line>Godot:
If you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A <textEffects>fake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
A-A <textEffects>Fake☆DeMasque</textEffects>?
</line><line>Maya:
Fake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.
</line><line>Godot:
Now, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, <span style="color:#E16935">Fake☆DeMasque</textEffects>!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The proof is right here.
</line><line>Judge:
This looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But if you look closely... you'll notice <textEffects>something peculiar</textEffects> about it.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. <textEffects>Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so "peculiar".</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It's right here, of course!
</line><line>Judge:
You mean... <textEffects>Mask☆DeMasque</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.
</line><line>Maya:
Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The problem I have with the security camera photo is the <textEffects>broach</textEffects> on DeMasque's chest.
</line><line>Judge:
A Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.
</line><line>Judge:
A clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no <textEffects>broach</textEffects>!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this "Mask☆DeMasque" is a fake!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...
</line><line>Godot:
Hey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Where did you find it!?
</line><line>Godot:
Well I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Buddha statue</textEffects>"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)</span>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?
</line><line>Godot:
...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.
</line><line>Maya:
Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.
</line><line>Godot:
It's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little <textEffects>hickeys</textEffects> on there, too.
</line><line>Judge:
H-Hickeys?
</line><line>Godot:
Figuratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to <textEffects>Ron DeLite's fingerprints</textEffects>.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaa...?
</line><line>Judge:
What!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!
</line><line>Godot:
I've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been <textEffects>torn</textEffects> off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.
</line><line>Godot:
Obviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>DeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Well Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.
</line><line>Godot:
You've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...That doesn't sound good at all.
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Godot:
One second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.
</line><line>Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What's clear?
</line><line>Atmey:
...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, yes. That's right.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.
</line><line>Atmey:
Well, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.
</line><line>Maya:
Boy, these two make a prefect pair...
</line><line>Phoenix:
They'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.
</line><line>Judge:
I've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.
</line><line>Atmey:
...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What I Witnessed --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atmey:
It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.
That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!
Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!
Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.
Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?
</line><line>Atmey:
My specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.
</line><line>Judge:
...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.
</line><line>Atmey:
Well, Sir Old-timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

</line>


<line>Atmey:
<textEffects>Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Maya:
There's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Also, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? Which piece...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?
</line><line>Atmey:
Aha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?
</line><line>Atmey:
Ha... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not quite. It clearly shows <textEffects>signs of having been ripped off</textEffects> a piece of clothing.
</line><line>Judge:
Ripped off...? Aha!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...We can only deduce that the thief <textEffects>struggled</textEffects> with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!
</line><line>Atmey:
...Urk! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night! So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!
</line><line>Atmey:
Err, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-timer!
</line><line>Judge:
Don't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!
</line><line>Atmey:
Hee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.
</line><line>Godot:
The true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You talk too much.
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?
</line><line>Godot:
Hold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
E-Excuse me...?
</line><line>Godot:
Save the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.
</line><line>Atmey:
Indeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Fight With The Thief --</textEffects></center>
<line>Atmey:
Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.
However... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!
Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.
A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.
His first blow struck true! Bam!... And that's all she wrote.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?
</line><line>Atmey:
Correct. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.

Well what do you think, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah? What is it!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!
</line><line>Maya:
B-But why?

I think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. <textEffects>(...And about the true nature of this "detective".)</textEffects>

Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.
</line><line>Atmey:
What fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe this is what you said yesterday.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Atmey:
No, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head <textEffects>from behind</textEffects> with this gruesome item here!

<line>Judge:
From behind, huh?

But just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!
</line><line>Atmey:
...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
For example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!
</line><line>Atmey:
U-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's wrong!

Really? What is it like then!?

...!

Always chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Very well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!
</line><line>Atmey:
Yeeeeaaargggh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was "hiding" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to "miraculously" retrieve the stolen treasure.
</line><line>Atmey:
Th-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, "Detective Atmey"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Atmey:
Gurk...!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
He didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing "<textEffects>security</textEffects>"... Then he simply dressed as the "<textEffects>thief</textEffects>" and stole the urn.
</line><line>Judge:
So... the Ace Detective is actually an <textEffects>Ace Thief</textEffects>! Is this true, witness!?
</line><line>Atmey:
... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! Now's your chance!

Yes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--

"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...
</line><line>Godot:
I will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! <textEffects>(Wh-What's the big rush...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Are you alright, Nick?

</line><line>Judge:
You're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?
</line><line>Godot:
Before casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?
</line><line>Desirée:
Y-Yes! What about it?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.
</line><line>Desirée:
Wh-What are you insinuating!?
</line><line>Godot:
As the wife of the criminal, you could have "<textEffects>discovered</textEffects>" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you "found" it.
</line><line>Desirée:
What...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!
</line><line>Godot:
Please Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.
</line><line>Desirée:
You're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!

Ms. DeLite...
</line><line>Desirée:
Please, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!

Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?

Mr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!

Mr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?
</line><line>Ron:
Err, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.
</line><line>Phoenix:
This wallet was found at approximately <textEffects>1:00 AM</textEffects> at KB Security headquarters.
</line><line>Judge:
What...!? Surely you're not serious!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!

Noooooo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!

Noooooo!

Look, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.
</line><line>Maya:
"Planted" it there? He's really reaching now...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's <textEffects>CEO's office</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ron:
Noooo!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Godot:
"<textEffects>Motive</textEffects>" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then. Let's see your evidence. <textEffects>The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!</textEffects>

Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?
</line><line>Ron:
Ah...! Th-That's...!

What is it?

</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, basically it says, "bring $50,000 dollars".
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
At the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was <textEffects>dealing with the blackmailer</textEffects> himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!
</line><line>Godot:
...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!
</line><line>Godot:

</line><line>Godot:
...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Godot:
You say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.
</line><line>Godot:
Accusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Not sure what I think of that?"... At least I know what I think of you...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant <textEffects>entered the CEO's office</textEffects>... ...but you will need at least one <textEffects>witness</textEffects> to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.
</line><line>Godot:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is <textEffects>someone else</textEffects> who can testify. This is the person who can testify <textEffects>that the key card was used</textEffects> at 1 AM that night!
</line>


<line>Judge:
Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't remember him, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.
</line><line>Maya:
It looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
He probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.
</line><line>Godot:
Oh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The question at hand is this key card.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Butz:
Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the <textEffects>CEO's office</textEffects>. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a <textEffects>record</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!
</line><line>Godot:
Bwaaaah...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Godot?
</line><line>Godot:
The name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.
</line><line>Judge:
S-So what does it show!?
</line><line>Godot:
Each key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at <textEffects>1 AM</textEffects> on the morning of the crime.
</line><line><textEffects>Key Card updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But that means... it <textEffects>can't be</textEffects> Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... So then...!
</line><line>Godot:
Ron DeLite was clearly <textEffects>in the office of KB Security's CEO</textEffects> at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that <textEffects>fact</textEffects>. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.
</line><line>Maya:
Good job! You did it, Nick!
</line><line>Judge:
...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of "thief"! ...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor!
</line><line>Godot:
Hrpmh...!
</line><line>Ron:
Unnnggh...
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>

Maya:
Nick! You did it! You were right after all! Actually... I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.
</line><line>Desirée:
Nicky boy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh! Ms. DeLite...!
</line><line>Desirée:
I knew you could do it! I believed in you all along, Nicky boy! ...I don't know how I can ever repay you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aww... Shucks... Thanks, Ms. DeLite. <textEffects>(I just know I'm blushing...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Congratulations, Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh! P-Pearls...! <textEffects>(I've got a bad feeling about this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
*gasp!* Wh-Who is this woman!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, she... She's nobody... She's just ahh...
</line><line>Pearl:
You're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeowch! She slapped me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Umm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.
</line><line>Pearl:
*gasp!* Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes!?
</line><line>Pearl:
You're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-N-No! You've got it all wrong!
</line><line>Pearl:
I'll never forgive you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Owww... A double slap...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Well, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!
</line><line>Desirée:
You're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!
</line><line>Maya:
But actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
</line><line>Desirée:
Oh, please... You're embarrassing me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still looks so glum...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ron:
Ugggh... But I am the thief... Actually<textEffects>, what's the point now</textEffects>
</line><line>Desirée:
...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!
</line><line>Ron:
I-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...
</line><line>Godot:
Come on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?
</line><line>Godot:
Oh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me "buddy"...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
Well, playtime is over.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Godot:
Early this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.
</line><line>Maya:
Kane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?
</line><line>Desirée:
Isn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?
</line><line>Maya:
B-<textEffects>Body</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Godot:
The estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>1 AM on October 12th</textEffects>...? Y-You don't mean!?
</line><line>Godot:
...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-So then... What are you doing here?
</line><line>Godot:
Oh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Helped me out</textEffects>"? What!?)</span>
</line><line>Godot:
On October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The <textEffects>scene of the murder</textEffects>. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been <textEffects>imbrued with utter rage</textEffects>.
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?
</line><line>Godot:
Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it! Ron DeLite was once an <textEffects>employee</textEffects> of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(An employee of KB Security!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Godot:
It looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an "<textEffects>anti-alibi</textEffects>".
</line><line>Maya:
No way...
</line><line>Godot:
He can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!
</line><line>Desirée:
N-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!
</line><line>Ron:
Oh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!
</line><line>Godot:
Ron DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be <textEffects>tried for murder</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!
</line><line>Godot:
I'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Godot:
You and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?
</line><line>Godot:
I've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous <span style="color:#E16935">enemy</textEffects> I've ever faced...)</span>
</line><line>Godot:
Well then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick...! How could this be happening?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right in front of our every eyes, our client has been <textEffects>arrested for murder</textEffects>. And the one who established his presence at the scene... was <textEffects>me</textEffects>.
</line><line>Desirée:
EEEEEYYYAAAAHHH! R-RONNNIEEEEEEEE!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Arrested for murder</textEffects> on the very same day he's declared innocent of larceny... What the heck's going to happen next!?)</span>
