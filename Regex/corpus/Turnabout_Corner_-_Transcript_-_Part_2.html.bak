Apollo:
Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today?
</line><line>Trucy:
He said his old foot injury was acting up.
</line><line>Apollo:
Old injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday!
</line><line>Trucy:
Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine "as long as you're there, Trucy".
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!!
</line><line>Trucy:
...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training.
</line><line>???:
...I'm fine! I'm fine! You know what I'm saying!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack! G-Good morning!
</line><line>Wocky:
Yo, 'sup. Hit me with the guilty verdict, G! See if I care. You just hang loose and let things go with the flow. You know what I'm saying!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, not really.
</line><line>Big Wins:
Wocky! Don't be running your mouth like that in here!
</line><line>Wocky:
See, that's the difference between me and you, old man. I ain't afraid of no cops. Real G's can't keep it real till they spend some hard time in the pen.
</line><line>Big Wins:
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
</line><line>Trucy:
Sounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!)</textEffects>

District CourtCourtroom No. 4</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.
</line><line>Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ready to rock 'n' roll, Herr Judge.
</line><line>Trucy:
Ah! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Long time no see... Prosecutor Gavin. Were you taking a leave of absence?
</line><line>Klavier:
You know that little band I started in my free time? Thing is, we got real popular. Hard to say "nein" to your fans when three of your singles go platinum, ja?
</line><line>Judge:
...I see. To be honest, I was a little concerned. I feared that you might still be distraught over that one trial...
</line><line>Klavier:
Not to worry, Herr Judge. I wouldn't miss this day in court for the world. It's worth even more than VIP passes to one of my concerts, ja? How could I pass up a chance to see the true strength... ...of the little boy who bested my brother?
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
It was worth canceling a show or two.
</line><line>Judge:
Understood. You may give your opening statements to the court.
</line><line>Klavier:
Before that, I was thinking... Is the air in this courtroom not a bit... serious?
</line><line>Judge:
It IS a court of law.
</line><line>Klavier:
That's no way to get the crowd jumping, Herr Judge.
</line><line>Judge:
They're not supposed to jump! This is a courtroom!
</line><line>Klavier:
Achtung, baby! Today, we play it my way!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's that... noise?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Sometimes you have to get on up in order to get down... to prosecuting!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This is crazy...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
The victim... Pal Meraktis, director of the <textEffects>Meraktis Clinic</textEffects>. The scene... <textEffects>People Park</textEffects>. He was found pulling a noodle stand.
</line><line>Judge:
What in the world was a doctor doing pulling a noodle stand?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes, I believe... ...you will only find that out by asking the defendant, right here, right now. Because it's an undeniable truth that he shot the victim!
</line><line>Apollo:
What do you mean, undeniable?
</line><line>Klavier:
If you are to glare at anyone, Herr Justice, glare at the punk in the defendant's chair. His crime was witnessed quite clearly, you see.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. Please admit this witness to the court.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Nein! Not yet! First, there is a little matter to be cleaned up...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Could you talk without the accompaniment?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
I swear I could see the guitar for a second!
</line><line>Judge:
What is it, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
The "motive", Herr Judge. Why did the little punk do it? Why did he kill the director of the Meraktis Clinic?
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
Not so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that!
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh? But what if the defendant specifically requests to do so? As he did this morning? I want to "give a shout out to all my homeys!" I believe he said.
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What is right!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
They always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, this is highly unusual. But... The court will now hear from the defendant concerning his motive in the crime!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So... You, son, are the defendant... Wocky, are you?
</line><line>Wocky:
I ain't your son, old man! You step to a Kitaki, you best be prepared to step strong!
</line><line>Klavier:
You "step" to a public official, you'd best be prepared to step into jail.
</line><line>Trucy:
You got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(It's not his guts I'm worried about...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, the court will now hear testimony on the defendant's motive... ...from the defendant himself!

<line>Wocky:
I'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!
Someone had to show him what's what!
I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.
And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!
So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!
That was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!
That's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You're saying you were one of the victim's patients...!?
</line><line>Wocky:
Lotta stuff goes down when you're keeping it real on the street. Tru dat. I tell you one thing, that doc was wack!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.

<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:</i>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor.
</line><line>Wocky:
Man, putting him down was like doing the world a favor!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...
</line><line>Trucy:
Chin up, Apollo! Back straight!
</line><line>Judge:
But, why did this mistake only come to light that day?
</line><line>Klavier:
It was found during the Family health check-up.
</line><line>Apollo:
The F-Family check-up?
</line><line>Wocky:
That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that.
</line><line>Wocky:
Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!
</line><line>Klavier:
...A relief to hear.
</line><line>Wocky:
Eh? Wh-What's a relief!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-Whaaat!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking "time bomb" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life.
</line><line>Wocky:
No way! Th-That's wacked!
</line><line>Klavier:
There is proof. Your check-up report.
</line><line><textEffects>Wocky's Check-Up Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...How ironic that you would kill the one man capable of helping you. You're almost as careless as he was! ...Ah ha ha ha.
</line><line>Wocky:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Well, now that the place is hopping... Let's get this gig started!
</line><line>Judge:
S-Started...?
</line><line>Klavier:
We've had enough of a warm-up act, ja? Time to hear from the witness!
</line><line>Trucy:
...Wocky sure is quiet all of a sudden.
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm a little uneasy myself. <textEffects>(Is this Gavin's strategy...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
So. You will tell us your name and occupation.
</line><line>Stickler:
My name... is Wesley Stickler. By "occupation" I take it you refer to some labor that "profits" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being "unemployed" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of "identity" which is commonly attached to this notion of "occupation", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the "vagueness" inherent in all representations of thoug--
</line><line>Klavier:
By which he means to say that he is a student. A junior at Ivy University if I'm not mistaken?
</line><line>Stickler:
Yes, in the Department of Science and Engineering. Filled with curiosity for all things, I spend my days in pursuit of truth, honing my...
</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Stickler, please direct said curiosity to the case at hand today.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Stickler. Please testify to the court about what you saw on the night of the crime.
</line><line>Stickler:
You ask, quite simplistically, "what I saw". However, we must understand that homo sapiens possess two eyes, each of these designed to receive and interpret data, sending images in the form of signals to the...

<line>Stickler:
That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them!
One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.
I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.
In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.
A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Was there anyone else in the park at that time?
</line><line>Stickler:
I can say with 100% accuracy that there was not.
</line><line>Klavier:
The pistol our witness refers to... is this.
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts this into evidence.

<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
We always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.)</textEffects>

Is that you... relaxing, I see, Herr Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!!
</line><line>Judge:
...Once is quite enough, Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet!
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this!
</line><line>Judge:
The... autopsy report? Is there a problem with the autopsy report?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound!
</line><line>Judge:
The location...?
</line><line>Apollo:
You testified that the killer shot the victim "square in the forehead", did you not?
</line><line>Stickler:
Ah, I have already determined your "angle" of inquiry. ...Allow me to explain. It
is quite simple, really: First, understand that when I say "square", I speak not of geometrical absolute. What do I mean by this? For example, the defection of a "meter" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know. In addition, it is a well known fact that krypton particles are rare, and invisible to the naked eye, which points to a basic fallacy in your line of reasoning, namely, that wh--
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Was your objection to these, er, krypton particle things?
</line><line>Klavier:
This is the big time, and you are obsessed with something so small? You disappoint me.
</line><line>Apollo:
N-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!
</line><line>Judge:
Do tell...
</line><line>Apollo:
Just look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the <textEffects>right temple</textEffects>!
</line><line>Stickler:
T-Temple...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot "<textEffects>square in the forehead</textEffects>"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? <textEffects>(It is, right? Finally!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Justice... Oh, Herr Justice...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Your tactics are outdated. Trying to shake the witness by objecting to trifles? Surely you haven't forgotten the fatal wound your master suffered seven years ago? Phoenix Wright... was it?
</line><line>Apollo:
...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!
</line><line>Stickler:
Nyurk...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Hey, Herr Forehead...
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(F... "Forehead"!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Let us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, "Stop!"
</line><line>Klavier:
And you, Fräulein?
</line><line>Trucy:
M-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, "Eeeeeek!"
</line><line>Klavier:
And you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack...! <textEffects>(If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stickler:
...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory.
</line><line>Judge:
It sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required.

<line>Stickler:
As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.
"Cease this at once, you two!" I cried... with composure.
The victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.
Whereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.
Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I see... So you attempted to stop the crime.
</line><line>Stickler:
Indeed. ...With composure.
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.
</line><line>Apollo:
Th-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.
</line><line>Klavier:
Let us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, "Oh stop! Please!" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the <textEffects>right temple</textEffects>, as in the report.
</line><line>Judge:
That does seem to be the case.

<line>Trucy:
I liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.
</line><line>Apollo:
Not as sad as I feel. What do we do now?
</line><line>Trucy:
At least the testimony's getting a little clearer.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were "wiped" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol!
</line><line>Stickler:
...That may be. But it does not change what I saw. The killer... the defendant... He threw down the murderous weapon from his hand and fled.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Stickler:
And this pistol was found at the scene of the crime. Strongly suggesting that this was the weapon he disposed of!
</line><line>Klavier:
That sounds solid to me. Well, Herr Forehead? Any of your precious "objections"?
</line><line>Apollo:
...
</line><line>Trucy:
What gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work!
</line><line>Apollo:
You know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say.
</line><line>Trucy:
What do you mean, "nothing to say"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Isn't what obvious?
</line><line>Trucy:
When he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a "murderous weapon". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're right!
</line><line>Trucy:
He's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong.
</line><line>Stickler:
W-Well! It can be said that I'm quite offended! While it is, indeed, true that once, in my youth, I wrote a love letter in my own blood that was seized by the teacher and posted on the blackboard for all to see, and for this the appellation "poor" might as well be prefixed to my name, yet as for the issue at ha--
</line><line>Judge:
What we can say for certain is that the witness saw the killer throw "something"... Does the defense have anything to say about this?
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, if what he threw wasn't a pistol...
</line><line>Apollo:
Then it had to be something else!
</line><line>Klavier:
At least one person on the defense team seems to be thinking.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps you can inform the court as to the nature of this "something else"? What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Is that... a sword? I saw one of those on the late night movie last night!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Great, a sleep-deprived judge...)</textEffects> This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it.
</line><line>Judge:
His prints!
</line><line>Apollo:
This single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down <textEffects>wasn't a pistol</textEffects>. Two, that the defendant <textEffects>wasn't wearing gloves</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed!
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, Herr Forehead? You're forgetting two other things you've just proven.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Klavier:
One, that the man the witness saw was the defendant, Mr. Wocky Kitaki. Two, that the defendant was holding a knife, with the intent of harming the victim!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
This court is of the opinion that our witness is fond of making assumptions. In that light, I believe it would behoove us to hear about what really occurred... ...with less assuming, please!
</line><line>Stickler:
It is always the same with you people. "Mark left the house on foot, and five minutes later, his brother left after him. How long would it take for Mark's brother to catch up to him... ...assuming that Mark never had to stop for a traffic light!" "Assuming"... Yes, that's what I said. "Assuming"! As if that were a probable situation at all! Yet here you are "assuming" that my "assumption" is no better!
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. What this court "assumes"... ...is that the witness will testify as to what happened after the shot was fired!

<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- From Shot to Call --</textEffects></center>
<line>Stickler:
I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.
Nor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.
Ergo! I used my cell phone to call the police.
Until the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Why didn't you chase the killer?
</line><line>Stickler:
He was, as you say, a killer. Of course, I could have run him down, yet what would he have done when cornered? Sadly, it takes more than an aptitude for solving quadratic equations to know that.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Klavier:
Did the testimony earlier not prove the defendant's presence at the scene? And do we not also now know that there was no one else there? ...It seems clear that we have our killer. Does it not?
</line><line>Judge:
Does it not, Mr. Justice?

</line><line>Judge:
It appears there are no objections to the witness's current testimony.
</line><line>Klavier:
There are any number of ways to explain the lack of prints on the pistol, I assure you. Perhaps the killer really was wearing gloves which wiped the previous user's prints off. Then, after the deed was done, this fell out of his pocket as he was throwing the gun away. A mistake befitting of a small-time punk, in my opinion.
</line><line>Apollo:
No... Nooooooooooo!

How unfortunate. It seems that you weren't cut out to stand on the same stage as me. Were you, Herr Forehead?

</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! Now is not the time to be threatening me! It's you who's being threatened here!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Remember what you said to Wocky's father yesterday? You promised you'd save his son!
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But that testimony was rock solid! What are you suggesting I do?
</line><line>Trucy:
Look, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will!
</line><line>Apollo:
Trucy, no more staged abductions, please...
</line><line>Trucy:
I'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can <textEffects>perceive</textEffects> what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got...
</line><line>Apollo:
You can see... what he's "feeling"?
</line><line>Trucy:
Think back, Apollo. Think back to the times when there was a contradiction in his testimony! All the times!
</line><line>Apollo:
All the times there was a contradiction...?
</line>


<line>Trucy:
There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in. And each time, there was a contradiction.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Stickler:
In his hand he held.. yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Stickler:
Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
He said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, that's true, but how does that help us?
</line><line>Trucy:
Didn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain <textEffects>habit</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Stickler:
In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
Did you see it? The very moment he said the word "pistol"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book!
</line><line>Apollo:
How'm I supposed to see that!?
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker?
</line><line>Apollo:
Wha--!?
</line><line>Trucy:
I always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling!
</line><line>Apollo:
You mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games?
</line><line>Trucy:
It's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long!
</line><line>Apollo:
Great, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? <textEffects>(I don't believe this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
You have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! <textEffects>Perceive</textEffects> the truth!
</line><line>Apollo:
"Watch" a testimony? "<textEffects>Perceive</textEffects>" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose.
</line><line>Trucy:
Not true!
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright said that? <textEffects>(Watch the testimony... <span style="color:#E16935">Perceive</textEffects> his true feelings... Is she serious!?)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
Time's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What was that she said before the trial started?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today?
</line><line>Trucy:
He said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine "as long as you're there, Trucy".
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Is this what he meant by us being "fine"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!)</textEffects> ...Let's do it.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo... 
</line><line>Apollo:
You know, I'm starting to think I can do this.
</line><line>Trucy:
...I knew you could do it all along! Oh, one more thing.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, you mean me?
</line><line>Judge:
Don't you have anything to report? Anything... concerning the mysterious phantom in the silk top hat?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah! Right! Him! Don't worry about him. I settled that.
</line><line>Judge:
You "settled" that...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Erm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right.
</line><line>Klavier:
Perhaps Fräulein would have us believe it was nothing more than a passing dream... ...a fantastic illusion, now you see it, now you don't. Am I right?
</line><line>Trucy:
...I think he's on to me.
</line><line>Apollo:
I wish he would stop being so... so cool.
</line><line>Klavier:
Let us dispense with these niceties and get straight to the matter. What are your plans for our gifted witness?
</line><line>Apollo:
R-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something.
</line><line>Judge:
There was no issue with the witness's previous testimony. I will grant your request, however. But this court will not permit stalling for time!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Understood, Your Honor.
</line><line>Trucy:
Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!

In this state, you can see everything, Apollo! Everything the witness does!
</line><line>Apollo:
Th-That's great, but this is kind of freaking me out!
</line><line>Trucy:
Just look for Mr. Stickler's twitch -- his habit. You remember it, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure! When he says something he's not sure of, he <textEffects>fiddles with a page of his book</textEffects>.
</line><line>Trucy:
You got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'll bet they are.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Apollo:
His <textEffects>hand</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Trucy:
You know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place.

<line>Trucy:
Perfect! Now you're really ready!
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Trucy:
Ready to <textEffects>perceive</textEffects> the truth behind the twitch!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Perceive</textEffects>...
</line><line>Trucy:
Try listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his <textEffects>habit</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... You mean when he fiddles with the page!
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to <textEffects>perceive</textEffects>! Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush!

</line><line>Stickler:
A-all this b-banging of desks! I-It's quite bad for my circulation, you know.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!?
</line><line>Stickler:
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? <textEffects>(Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Judge:
Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Apollo:
This cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage!
</line><line>Judge:
The Meraktis... Why, that's where the victim lived!
</line><line>Stickler:
Yeeeeeerrgh! Th-That's impossible!
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!?
</line><line>Stickler:
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeouk!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Stickler:
It... It's true. I didn't have my cell phone that night. That is why it can be said that I called the police from a public pay phone.
</line><line>Judge:
A pay phone! So you didn't call on your cell phone after all...
</line><line>Apollo:
Just where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!?
</line><line>Stickler:
Well, to indicate it with a startlingly high degree of accuracy... ...it was right around here.
</line><line>Judge:
That's... quite a ways from the park. But... But why did you lie?
</line><line>Apollo:
There can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage!
</line><line>Stickler:
Wh-Wh-What are you saying!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all!
</line><line>Stickler:
B-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night.
</line><line>Stickler:
W-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime.
</line><line>Trucy:
Now's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. <textEffects>(Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:
</line>


<line>Judge:
That's... a side-view mirror?
</line><line>Apollo:
As it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!
</line><line>Stickler:
An accident!?
</line><line>Apollo:
An accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!
</line><line>Stickler:
Wh-What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Apollo:
From the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!
</line><line>Stickler:
Urk...
</line><line>Apollo:
Ergo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!
</line><line>Stickler:
Weeeeeeeeoooorrgh!
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.
</line><line>Judge:
This is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!?
</line><line>Stickler:
N-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something!
</line><line>Klavier:
I suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this.
</line><line>Judge:
I believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared?
</line><line>Stickler:
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!!

</line><line>Apollo:
I see...
</line><line>Stickler:
What? Why are you looking at me like that? Is that... pity I see in your eyes!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's take a look at our map, shall we? So, you're claiming that when you saw the sign, you were standing... Here, was it? ...Although, it would've been a bit hard to read the sign from this spot.
</line><line>Stickler:
Y-You think so?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Stickler. I'd like you to please take another look at the stand. ...and to carefully read what the sign says. See? That sign actually states the name of the stand's owner. ..."<textEffects>ELDOON'S</textEffects>".
</line><line>Stickler:
E... El... Eld... Inconceivable! I'm certain it was definitely "NOODLE" for sure! Positive!
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid your professor was wrong about that eyesight.
</line><line>Apollo:
I wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion. <textEffects>(The sign he saw changes everything!)</textEffects> The witness says the sign said "<textEffects>NOODLE</textEffects>"...
</line>


<line>Apollo:
What would you say if I told you... ...that there is one spot from which the sign would be read the way Mr. Stickler claims?
</line><line>Stickler:
What...?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice! Show us this spot!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>The witness actually viewed the stand from this location!</textEffects>
</line>




<line>Apollo:
The witness was standing... Here! On the <textEffects>opposite</textEffects> side!
</line><line>Judge:
H-How do you know that?
</line><line>Apollo:
When viewed from the south... ...the sign on the stand reads "<textEffects>ELDOON'S</textEffects>", as we know. ...However! Observe the other side of the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! This side says "<textEffects>NOODLE</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly! The name of the stand is split between the front and back signs! Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court! You witnessed the crime from the <textEffects>northern</textEffects> side of the park, not the south!
</line><line>Stickler:
Yeeeow! Y-You got me!

</line><line>Klavier:
...So what.
</line><line>Apollo:
S-So what!?
</line><line>Klavier:
What does it matter if he saw the killing from the north or the south side? It makes no difference at all!
</line><line>Stickler:
H-He's right! Travel far enough to the south, and you will end up going north! Viewed on a global scale, directions are utterly without meaning!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Actually, maybe he's right. What does it change?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
It changes everything, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
Remember his testimony from before... Though to be honest, I'm a little scared of where this is leading... The killer and the victim are facing each other here. Then, at the moment the killer raises his weapon... ...Mr. Stickler <textEffects>shouts</textEffects>! At which point, the victim turns his head to look... ...and the killer fires his pistol. That's why the bullet hit him in the <textEffects>right temple</textEffects>. No contradictions, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... But if Mr. Stickler was standing on the <textEffects>north</textEffects> side of the park... ...that <textEffects>reverses</textEffects> the whole scenario!
</line><line>Trucy:
Completely! If Mr. Stickler shouts from where he is now... ...and the victim looks in his direction... ...the bullet would have to hit his <textEffects>left</textEffects> temple!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... Aaaaah!
</line><line>Trucy:
In other words, someone standing at point "K"... ...couldn't shoot the victim in his right temple. It's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's right!
</line><line>Trucy:
So, now that we know that Mr. Stickler was standing on the northern side... ...the wound location takes on an entirely different meaning!
</line><line>Klavier:
Indeed... You are absolutely correct, Fräulein.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh... What meaning!?
</line><line>Trucy:
The entry wound was on the right side of the victim's head, correct? Well, the right side of the victim's head... is <textEffects>north</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
North... Ah!!! But that's where the <textEffects>witness</textEffects>, Wesley Stickler was standing!
</line><line>Trucy:
Correct. So, if he was standing to the north... ...then the only person here who could have shot the victim in the right temple... ...was Mr. Stickler himself!
</line><line>Stickler:
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeooooooowwwrgh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wow... The apple didn't fall far from the tree! She's flipped this whole case on its head while I was still figuring it out!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
...Clarify one point for me if you would, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
What now?
</line><line>Klavier:
Are you truly accusing this college student... ...of murder?
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(Well, I can't say he exactly looks innocent... But... something still doesn't feel right. I just can't picture him as the <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Stickler:
No, please! Looks aside, I'm really a nice guy! All my friends say so!
</line><line>Judge:
Let's hear what the defense has to say.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What are you going to do now, Justice!? Should I really accuse Mr. Stickler!?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...I don't think Wesley Stickler is a killer. But he's not innocent, either! His unusual silence tells me that much...)</textEffects> ...Mr. Stickler! You seem unusually quiet... Tell us why, now!
</line><line>Stickler:
... Th-The word "confession" isn't in my dictionary!
</line><line>Klavier:
Tsk, tsk, tsk, Herr Forehead. I'm afraid it falls to you to elucidate Herr Stickler's silence.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, you did say you were accusing the witness just now... ...for a crime other than murder. Your reason? The court's all ears.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Gah! I know he's guilty of something... but what crime other than murder is there? Do I have evidence that shows his involvement in some other crime...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Your evidence? The court's all eyes, Mr. Justice. Show us evidence that points to the witness's involvement in a crime!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The evidence... is this!
</line><line>Judge:
What!? Is that... women's underwear!?
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey! Those are mine!
</line><line>Stickler:
D-Don't look at me like thaaaaaaat!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! ...Mr. Stickler. While I can't say this comes as a shock...
</line><line>Stickler:
I-It's not what it seems! By Pythagorilla's Theorem, I swear it!
</line><line>Apollo:
On the night of the murder, just past 9 PM... A young girl catches a panty-snatcher red-handed! Bravely, she gives chase, but the snatcher flees... ...and hides himself in no other place than the Meraktis Clinic garage!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah ha!
</line><line>Apollo:
Incidentally... ...these panties were found in the exhaust pipe of the car there. Presumably, he was trying to hide the evidence of his crime. Ergo! While you may not be a murderer... ...you are guilty of panty-snatching in the first degree!
</line><line>Stickler:
Please! Here me out! It's not what it looks like!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Stickler. You should be ashamed!
</line><line>Stickler:
It's... not... what... it... seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeems... *gasp*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So, are we to understand that you were silent not because you were guilty of murder... ...but because you lacked the courage to admit your theft of this girl's undergarments?
</line><line>Stickler:
Ahem. Perhaps you are not aware that my school's name was originally written "IV"! "I" stands for "Intelligent", "V" stands for "Valiant"! See!?
</line><line>Judge:
...Your point?
</line><line>Stickler:
I'm not done! Now, I'm a major in the Science Department... ...and what does science teach if not curiosity!? Yes, we of the Ivy U. Science Department are valiantly curious! No challenge is too daunting, and what greater challenge to science than a mystery!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
C'mon! You're talking about a girl's panties here!
</line><line>Stickler:
No! You do not understand! A mystery is the unknown, and the unknown is unacceptable! And, my friends, when it comes to mysteries, those panties are the promised land! From the moment I first laid eyes on them, I was compelled to investigate... for science! A full-sized car tire was only the first mystery those panties revealed!
</line><line>Apollo:
A... tire?
</line><line>Stickler:
Yes! I saw her do it! She pulled a tire out of those panties! But that's not all! First, there was the tire, then a stewpot, and a frozen chicken! One mystery after another! It was... It was magic!
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, I remember now! He's one of the regulars in the audience at the Wonder Bar!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...?
</line><line>Trucy:
He's talking about my Magic Panties trick!
</line><line>Stickler:
I just don't understand... A broom... from a pair of panties? It mocks the very laws of physics...
</line><line>Apollo:
A broom... and a frozen chicken, Trucy? What ever happened to doves and bunny rabbits?
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Stickler! You stole this girl's panties to understand a magic trick?
</line><line>Stickler:
You say "panties" but they are so much more than that! For me, they are an object for serious study!
</line><line>Klavier:
...I wonder... There has been a recent rash of panty-snatchings in the area... ...Were they all you?
</line><line>Stickler:
I... I am sorry. But I did it for science! Each time I spied a pair of panties flapping in the breeze, I thought maybe! Maybe this would be the pair that would elucidate the mystery... Even that night as she chased me through the streets, I wept tears of joy! Perhaps this is the night that I will seize the truth that lies within those panties! Yet woe was I! For once again the lacy heart-patterned truth slipped through my fingers a--
</line><line>Judge:
Still, that leaves one thing unexplained.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, you refer to our witness's other lie, yes? The witness claimed he saw the crime from the south, but was in fact, in the north.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. Would anyone care to explain why he lied about that?
</line><line>Stickler:
...
</line><line>Klavier:
Be my guest, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Me!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Did I not hear you correctly? Did you not say you "do not accuse the witness of murder"?
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Why, then, did the witness lie about his location at the time of the shooting? ...Or have you no idea?
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo... There's something about the way the diagram is arranged right now... When you think about it, right near where Mr. Stickler was standing... Isn't there a...?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? What say you? Do you have any evidence to show why the witness lied about his location?
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The evidence that shows why he lied... is this.
</line><line>Judge:
What!? More panties!?
</line><line>Klavier:
How many panties are you carrying in your pocket, Herr Forehead?
</line><line>Apollo:
These are the last!! Honest!! These were found in a trash can at the park. Looking at the diagram... ...we can see that the trash can was right next to where the witness stood.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Stickler... You didn't...
</line><line>Stickler:
Alas! I'm a failure as a scientist! I can't unravel the mysteries of the universe! I can't even unravel a pair of panties!
</line><line>Judge:
So... these panties are you handiwork as well...?
</line><line>Stickler:
Th... That night, I had been chased, hounded into the Meraktis Clinic garage... Weeping in frustration, I was forced to abandon my prize! Don't you see how I felt!?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Believe me, I'd rather not.
</line><line>Stickler:
I hid in the garage for a short while... Then, abandoning the panties, I made for home. To avoid the office where the girl works, I went towards the south entrance... ...when I saw them hanging there on a clothesline by a giant mansion... ...A giant pair of panties!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Apparently he didn't know those bloomers belonged to the mob...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stickler:
I had them, safe in my pocket, ready to take home... ...when I stumbled upon a murder.
</line><line>Apollo:
The murder of Dr. Meraktis.
</line><line>Stickler:
I reported what I had seen, but as I waited for the police to arrive... I got scared. What if they searched me!?
</line><line>Apollo:
That's when you disposed of the bloomers?
</line><line>Stickler:
Yes... it was a severe blow to the progress of science, but one that had to be born.
</line><line>Judge:
A fascinating, if disturbing tale.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I believe this brings today's proceedings to a close. And I'm more than pleased to dismiss this witness for the remainder of the trial.
</line><line>Klavier:
One last thing, if I might.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Regardless of where we ended today, some vital points were made. Namely, that the defendant, Wocky Kitaki, was at the scene of the crime. And... he was pointing a weapon at the victim. ...One more thing. Wocky Kitaki has a clear motive.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed, the defendant Wocky Kitaki is still the prime suspect in this case. The only suspect, in fact. Assuming there was no one else on the scene at the time. Yet, a mystery remains... The location of the wound in the victim's right temple has yet to be explained. The court requests further investigation from both the defense and prosecution.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Ja, baby.
</line><line>Apollo:
...No problem!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. This brings the trial for the day to a close. Court is adjourned!
