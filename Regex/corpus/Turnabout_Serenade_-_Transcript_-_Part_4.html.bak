Trucy:
Well, this is it!
</line><line>Apollo:
Today's the day it all goes down. <textEffects>(And then there was yesterday...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Daryan:
This meeting is over. ...Sorry.
</line><line>Apollo:
Just give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.
</line><line>Daryan:
Sorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.
</line><line>Trucy:
Daryan! Wait!
</line><line>Daryan:
...I never liked you. Either of you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...And I think I know why. Time to bring down a little Justice!)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>...BANG!...</textEffects></center>
<line>
Trucy:
Eeek!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What was that!?
</line><line>???:
He is heard but unseen...
</line><line>Trucy:
Who's that talking...?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Valant Gramarye! <textEffects>(...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
You... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?
</line><line>Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! A preposterous proposition. How could I stand to stand upon the stand? Why, my secrets would be free for the plucking! ...I might even have to sign autographs! That is why I intend to remain hidden for the entire day.
</line><line>Trucy:
Ooh, with vanishing magic!?
</line><line>Valant:
Indeed! I will jump upon an express train, and express myself to the next town over! But before I go... a word of warning.
</line><line>Trucy:
Warning...? What?
</line><line>Valant:
A grand Gramarye glamour resides at the root of all that has happened. Do not forget this truth.
</line><line>Apollo:
A... glamour?
</line><line>Valant:
A spell, a sorcery... a great illusion! ...Miss Trucy, though it pains me to part so... ...I need to get in line for a ticket. Farewell!
</line><line>Trucy:
And there he goes.
</line><line>Apollo:
He sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!
</line><line>Apollo:
So he was talking about what we saw at the concert.
</line><line>Trucy:
Lamiroir's disappearing act.
</line><line>Apollo:
And Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.
</line><line>Trucy:
I wonder what he meant by it being at "the root of all that has happened"?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, it's about time. Shall we go?
</line><line>Bailiff:
Ah, excuse me, sir.
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Bailiff:
The scheduled starting time for the trial has been changed. The trial will not be commencing until 10:30 AM. Sorry for the inconvenience.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Did something happen? This is a first...
</line><line>Bailiff:
It was by the judge's request. Some urgent personal business.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bailiff:
Apparently, he's visiting the hospital again.
</line><line>Apollo:
The hospital?
</line><line>Bailiff:
I believe it was mentioned that the Chief Justice's son is unwell. Apparently his condition worsened considerably this morning.
</line><line>Apollo:
The Chief Justice's son...
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.
</line><line>Bailiff:
There's an article about it in the newspaper. If you care to read about it yourself...
</line><line><textEffects>Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Incuritis</textEffects>"...? Where have I heard that before?)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
I'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.
</line>

District CourtCourtroom No. 3</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Ahem. My apologies for the delay. Court is now in session for the trial of... erm, how do you say this name again?
</line><line>Klavier:
Machi Tobaye... our suspect fortissimo.
</line><line>Judge:
...Right. It's his trial, in any case.
</line><line>Apollo:
The defense is prepared, Your Honor.
</line><line>Klavier:
The prosecution... is ready to rock.
</line><line>Judge:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
I-Is something wrong, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
No. Well, yes... It's just, I've been friends with the Chief Justice since we were students. It pains me to see him going through such a difficult time.
</line><line>Trucy:
"Incuritis", was it? That article said there is no known cure!
</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Judge, let me say, with all honesty, I feel your pain. But, now is not the time for tears. Now is the time... for law.
</line><line>Judge:
...Indeed. We left off at quite the juncture yesterday.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Daryan:
I asked Interpol about that number. "IPXX314206"... The agent registered under this number... ...was Romein LeTouse.
</line><line>Judge:
Thanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.
</line><line>Daryan:
Oh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" /></a>
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Wait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.
</line><line>Judge:
It was "him"?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!
</line><line>Daryan:
...No way...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
Quite a sensational ending. Who would have thought Daryan would guest star in the season cliff-hanger... as a suspect?
</line><line>Judge:
I asked the prosecution to look into this matter. ...Please tell the court your findings.
</line><line>Klavier:
Daryan Crescend is a member of my band, the Gavinners... ...He is also a detective, making the current charges serious indeed. Yet, after investigation, I have found no cause to alter our case, or file new charges.
</line><line>Apollo:
...And your reason is?
</line><line>Klavier:
Weren't you aware, Herr Forehead? He has an impeccable alibi.
</line><line>Judge:
An alibi?
</line><line>Klavier:
Let us review the facts again, shall we? The concert held on the night of the shooting was in three sets. The Gavinners ripped up the stage during the first set. For the second set, our guest took center stage... The only performers appearing were myself, Lamiroir, and Machi... ...along with a drummer and bassist, for a total of five. The shooting in the dressing room, however, took place during the third set. Lamiroir and the defendant, Machi Tobaye had left the stage at that point... ...and the Gavinners were already rocking. This is when two shots rang out at the scene of the crime. Shots heard by Detective Ema Skye, mind you.
</line><line>Trucy:
And Apollo. You heard them too, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
I sure did.
</line><line>Klavier:
Furthermore, Lamiroir herself witnessed the moment of the crime... ...Well, perhaps I should say, she "heard" the moment of the crime. ...When she claims to have heard Mr. LeTouse and Detective Crescend "talking".
</line><line>Judge:
B-But that's impossible! Detective Crescend was...
</line><line>Klavier:
Precisely. Detective Crescend was on stage, getting his groove on, no less. Voila. A perfect alibi!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Does the defense have anything to add to this?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...It appears the defense has no objections. I believe we can safely say that Daryan Crescend's alibi has been acknowledged.
</line><line>Klavier:
Which means that Lamiroir was sadly mistaken. Her testimony cannot be true.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Of course, if we disregard her testimony... ...then I see no evidence keeping us from declaring a verdict. ...If indeed, there are no objections?
</line><line>Trucy:
Uh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Machi:
[Borginese speaking]........
</line><line>Lamiroir:
"About the case..."? What about the case?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Machi:
[Borginese speaking], [Borginese speaking]....
</line><line>???:
This meeting's over.
</line><line>Trucy:
...Daryan?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court finds the defendant, er, what was his name again?
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
Your Honor!!!
</line><line>Judge:
No, that wasn't it. It was something like "marquis" or-- ...Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Your Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!
</line><line>Klavier:
Exactly who else do you need to hear from?
</line><line>Apollo:
A witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.
</line><line>Klavier:
You don't mean...
</line><line>Apollo:
I do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!? But he doesn't speak English...
</line><line>Apollo:
We'll use an interpreter!
</line><line>Klavier:
Interpreter? I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. I only speak a few phrases, such as, "I love you," and, "Where is the toilet?"
</line><line>Apollo:
The defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.
</line><line>Judge:
L-Lamiroir!? But there's a possibility she's protecting the defendant...!
</line><line>Apollo:
But she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?
</line><line>Judge:
This is most unusual...
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah ha ha... Bravo, Herr Forehead. Herr Judge! The prosecution agrees with the defense's request. If Lamiroir lies, I'll be able to tell. Even my limited knowledge of the language should be enough for that.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, if both prosecution and defense are for this, I see little cause for refusal.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Finally! Some progress!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Please show the defendant and Lamiroir to the witness stand!
</line><line>Klavier:
I suppose there is a first time for everything. Shall we proceed?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
Your name, to begin with. ...If you would, Lamiroir.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Yes... He says, "Machi Tobaye, the defendant."
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, this is certainly a first for this courtroom. Not that we really needed an interpretation of that message in particular.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So far, so good...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr. Justice, if you would.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? If I would what, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
"Would what"!? You called the defendant to the stand, did you not? What would you have him testify about!?
</line><line>Apollo:
What do I want him to testify about...? <textEffects>(Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?
</line><line>Apollo:
How can I if I don't know what he was saying...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Excuse me, a moment. If I might speak?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Just now, Machi said there is something about which he "wishes to testify".
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What sort of testimony is he talking about?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...One moment, please.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lamiroir:
What...!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What? What!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
According to Machi... He has "proof of his innocence".
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Klavier:
...This is a surprise.
</line><line>Trucy:
Yahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, if that's true, then this is vital testimony! Lamiroir... I mean, Machi! Please testify to the court!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
"Very well."
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Proof of Innocence --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lamiroir:
He says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.
But if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...
...I, that is, he, could not have done it.
He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm. I see! He wouldn't have understood the English lyrics to the song. That would prevent him from following them so closely.
</line><line>Klavier:
I wondered what he meant by "proof". Why, he would only have to ask Lamiroir to know the meaning of that song.
</line><line>Apollo:
Lamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I did tell him, generally, what the song was about. But never in so much detail. And he never asked.
</line><line>Klavier:
Has my oft-repeated warning already fled that forehead? Lamiroir might be protecting the witness!
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Judge:
Well, anyway, let us proceed with the cross-examination. Mr. Justice, if you would.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Something's hidden in that testimony, I know it. I'll just have to trust my bracelet to tell me where! It worked yesterday, it'll work today!)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
I have here a <textEffects>Borginian Newspaper</textEffects>! The Borginian Daily Bugle, as a matter of fact!
</line><line>Machi:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
Indeed, there is a feature article about the case. Could you read this for me, Machi?
</line><line>Machi:
....!
</line><line>Apollo:
That's right. It doesn't mention the lyrics!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Wh-What? What is this all about?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm sorry Machi. You couldn't have read about the lyrics in a <textEffects>Borginian Newspaper</textEffects>!!!
</line><line>Machi:
! ........................ [Borginese speaking]!!!!!!!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
What does this mean!?
</line><line>Machi:
....................
</line><line>Lamiroir:
B-But I don't see how it's possible... Ah, I know! He must have heard the lyrics when the police were doing their questioning! Yes...
</line><line>Klavier:
Not possible, the subject of the lyrics was not brought up in police questioning. I read the full report myself.
</line><line>Apollo:
So, the lyrics weren't in the <textEffects>newspaper</textEffects> and the police didn't mention them. The only place you could have heard them was in this courtroom! ...In <textEffects>English</textEffects>, no less!
</line><line>Machi:
!
</line><line>Judge:
The witness will explain herself... er, himself!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Machi says... He says... ......
</line><line>Judge:
Yes?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
..."It is true I read the newspaper. But this is not where I learned of the lyrics. I was mistaken. Now I remember..."
</line><line>Apollo:
You remember...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...He says he heard of the lyrics from me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
Is this true, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...... Yes. I'm afraid I had forgotten it myself.
</line><line>Klavier:
Then it looks like Herr Forehead's been jumping to conclusions again.
</line><line>Judge:
It seems so, yes.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(No... No! I was onto something, I know it! I can't let this chance slip away...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Time is an issue today... Mr. Justice, are you finished with the cross-examination?
</line><line>Trucy:
What are you going to do, Apollo!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(If I'm going to keep on cross-examining, I'd better have an angle of attack... ...Or else!)</textEffects> ......! <textEffects>(My <span style="color:#E16935">bracelet</textEffects>'s still reacting!)</span> Your Honor! Please allow me to continue!
</line><line>Judge:
If you must, you must. Very well. Witness?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I understand.
</line><line><i>Changes statement from "He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them." to "He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not fully understand them."</i>

<line>Lamiroir:
<textEffects>It was I who explained that the crime followed the song.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Trucy:
Yay! I knew he was innocent!
</line><line>Apollo:
I believe he is, too, Trucy. I do...
</line><line>Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo? You got a tummy ache or something?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Something's hidden in that testimony... If it's the truth, I'll find it!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Lamiroir... I'm currently cross-examining Machi. ...Why should you be uncertain?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
! Me? Uncertain?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, you swallowed the very moment you told the court... ..."<textEffects>It was I who explained.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I see there is little point in trying to hide anything from you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Lamiroir, are you, indeed, <textEffects>protecting someone</textEffects>?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
That... is not a question with a simple answer. To tell the truth, I do not believe it myself.
</line><line>Apollo:
Then, allow me to answer for you. <textEffects>Lamiroir, you're protecting...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Lamiroir, you are protecting Machi. That's why you lied and told us that <textEffects>you had explained</textEffects> how the crime followed the song!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't fault you for trying to help, but this is not the way!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
Machi! I believe you didn't do it, really! I trust you! But you've lied to us twice. And now you have Lamiroir lying on your behalf!
</line><line>Machi:
................
</line><line>Apollo:
If this is going to work, you have to trust me, too.
</line><line>Machi:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
Your two lies cover a simple truth. You understand English. You have to!
</line><line>Machi:
! ........................ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Witness! Is this true? Do you understand English?
</line><line>Machi:
...Y-Yes. A little, only.
</line><line>Judge:
What!?
</line><line>Klavier:
First he <textEffects>could see</textEffects>, now he can talk. And you... did not know about this, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I... no. I did not! It is quite a surprise.
</line><line>Judge:
How many secrets is this witness hiding!?
</line><line>Machi:
Last... This is... last...
</line><line>Apollo:
Machi... could you tell us what really happened?
</line><line>Machi:
No shooting! I did no shooting!
</line><line>Apollo:
So, you weren't in the dressing room when I heard those two gunshots, correct?
</line><line>Machi:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Apparently, the answer to that question isn't simple either.
</line><line>Machi:
I was in... dressing room. Behind desk. Manager, he on floor...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Which would be after the shooting, right...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Machi:
...Then, there is voice...
</line><line>Trucy:
Voice? Or voices? Was it you and Ema, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
So when Machi went into the dressing room, Mr. LeTouse had already been shot. And then we came to the door.
</line><line>Machi:
...Panel high up. I take off. Run away, run away!
</line><line>Apollo:
So it was you who escaped through that air vent!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah ha ha. As the prosecution has held all along, no less. The defendant has admitted to being at the scene. Might we take this as a confession?
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
No! He's clearly denied that he did it!
</line><line>Machi:
I no shooting! Manager on floor. Already on floor...

</line><line>Klavier:
The victim had already been shot, you say? I find that hard to believe. The defendant understood the song lyrics. He was at the scene of the crime... This can only mean one thing. He is the shooter!
</line><line>Machi:
!
</line><line>Judge:
Does the defendant have anything to say to this?
</line><line>Machi:
......
</line><line>Trucy:
He's clammed up, Apollo!
</line><line>Judge:
Then let's ask Mr. Justice. Will you require any further testimony from the witness?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Is that it? Is there nothing else I can get him to testify about? Wait... no, of course there is!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
What is this cocoon, anyway?
</line><line>Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
</line><line>Lamiroir:
"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure."
</line><line>Trucy:
A cure...?
</line>
<hr />

Well, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?

[Borginese speaking]....

[Borginese speaking]!

....................
</line><line>Lamiroir:
He... won't tell me.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That cocoon has to have something to do with this!)</textEffects> Machi. Please, tell us the truth, for your own sake.
</line><line>Machi:
...No. No more speak. Not... to any of you.
</line><line>Klavier:
So much for your precious trust, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hey, you were the one who didn't believe him!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Regardless, this brings us to an impasse.
</line><line>Judge:
It does seem that the defense and defendant are at odds. ...I doubt we are likely to learn anything more of value should this continue. I see no other course but to declare a five minute recess! The defense will work things out with the defendant so that we might proceed!

Machi:
...Apollo Yoostis...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That's "Justice". Better learn how to say it if you ever want to get some.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Machi:
Believe. I no shooting.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Machi claims Mr. LeTouse was already down on the ground when he entered the room.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Maybe... it was a trap, and he walked right into it?
</line><line>Machi:
Suddenly. I hear revolver. Close. Very close. Then, I hear voice.
</line><line>Apollo:
You heard <textEffects>gunshots</textEffects>?
</line><line>Machi:
Yes. Is true. I hear revolver. But only sound.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you <textEffects>heard shots</textEffects>? <textEffects>(If that's true...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
So... you were at the scene of the crime when you heard those shots?
</line><line>Apollo:
And you escaped through the air vent.
</line><line>Machi:
I know.
</line><line>Trucy:
Huh? What do you know?
</line><line>Machi:
I know if I opening vent... ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area? Is that what he means...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, he's right! Look, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh... Yeah. But how did you know it was connected like that?
</line><line>Trucy:
Wait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!
</line><line>Machi:
I hear this. From magician.
</line><line>Apollo:
Magician...?
</line><line>Trucy:
D-Don't look at me!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(A magician, huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? <textEffects>(That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time. So... what do we do?
</line><line>Trucy:
You're sure you won't testify, Machi?
</line><line>Machi:
I... no talking. No.
</line><line>Trucy:
Hmm, well it was worth a shot.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That cocoon...)</textEffects>

<line>Machi:

</line><line>Lamiroir:

</line><line>Trucy:
Can't go home!?
</line><line>Machi:
....[Borginese speaking]....[Borginese speaking] ....[Borginese speaking]....
</line><line>Lamiroir:
"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home." The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That's right! It's punishable by death!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Of course... He's scared.)</textEffects> ...Oh well, I guess we'll just have to try a different approach.
</line><line>Trucy:
That's the spirit, Apollo! So, what's your plan?
</line><line>Apollo:
If Machi won't testify about it, we'll have to get someone else to testify.
</line><line>Trucy:
Someone... else?
</line><line>Apollo:
...I think we're out of time. Let's get back in there.
</line><line>Trucy:
Right!

...Court is now back in session. Mr. Justice. Have you sorted things out with the defendant?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. We had a good talk.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, very well. So will he testify?
</line><line>Apollo:
Your Honor, the defendant... will not testify.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Klavier:
...... Shame. And here I thought this was your big chance to turn the case around.
</line><line>Apollo:
Actually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
A different... angle?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!)</textEffects> I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!

</line><line>Klavier:
What are you up to now? I thought we determined yesterday that Lamiroir's testimony was insubstantial! There's nothing you can--
</line><line>Apollo:
...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.
</line><line>Judge:
What happened?
</line><line>Apollo:
She was assaulted, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Assaulted!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Someone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...
</line><line>Klavier:
What!? I've heard no such report!
</line><line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin...
</line><line>Klavier:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
Why would anyone be out to <textEffects>kill Lamiroir</textEffects>? Can you think of a reason?
</line><line>Klavier:
W-Well...
</line><line>Apollo:
Think of how she is known in our country... <textEffects>A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English</textEffects>, yes? Yet someone tried to <textEffects>keep her mouth shut</textEffects>! Who could that have been?
</line><line>Judge:
You don't think...
</line><line>Apollo:
I do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!
</line><line>Klavier:
So, am I to understand that this is what you are saying? Namely, that there is a nugget of "<textEffects>truth</textEffects>" in Lamiroir's testimony... ...A nugget we have yet to uncover?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Exactly.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... If Lamiroir was attacked, this has serious implications! Very well... There were some vague points in her testimony during yesterday's trial. Perhaps we did not inquire as deeply as we might have into some. The court will hear Lamiroir's testimony once more!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...Lamiroir, I must apologize. We must ask you to stand again and speak.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
You need not apologize. I know that Machi is innocent. And I will do all that I can until the court realizes this.
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's review your testimony from yesterday. <textEffects>You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend</textEffects>, yes?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...That is correct.
</line><line>Klavier:
At which point I proved she could not be correct. She couldn't have heard any of those things. The small window at the scene was closed, and was found to be quite soundproof.
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Judge:
...You have nothing to say to that, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!
</line><line>Klavier:
There is, it seems, much you do not know.
</line><line>Judge:
And yet it is my duty to hear him out. Perhaps the witness would be so kind as to testify once more to the court?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...Of course, Your Honor.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What I Heard --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.
That's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.
I heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.
There was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...
I was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Pretty much the same as yesterday's testimony.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I am sorry. I am not used to speaking much in this language. Perhaps my descriptions are lacking in some way. Yet, everything I have said here is the truth.
</line><line>Klavier:
Then it is my distinct displeasure to say this. What you have said to have happened... is impossible.
</line><line>Apollo:
Do I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!
</line><line>Klavier:
...!
</line><line>Trucy:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What? Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. Perhaps you can "coolly" cross-examine the witness?

<line>Apollo:
Lamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I have given it much reflection, but...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I only heard one phrase clearly.
</line><line>Apollo:
A whole phrase!?
</line><line>Klavier:
You remember something that was said!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Why didn't you say anything yesterday!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Though my memory is clear, I was afraid to speak. You see, I do not understand what was said.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!)</textEffects> W-Well what did he say!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
It was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.
</line><line>Apollo:
The shooter, then. <textEffects>(Daryan Crescend...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, what did he say!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...... "<textEffects>It's over. Press the switch! Now!</textEffects>"
</line><line>Judge:
"<textEffects>Switch</textEffects>"...? And the shooter said this to the victim, Mr. LeTouse?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I thought it quite strange myself, afterward.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. It is a mystery. What could it possibly mean? Mr. Justice? Care to shed some light on this?
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk. Um, I mean, sure...! I-I'd be delighted... It's, um, very, very vital! Maybe we could add that to the testimony!

<line>Apollo:
..."<textEffects>Press the switch.</textEffects>" There's only one key that can unlock the mystery of those words!
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh? Yet there was nothing at the scene that could be called a "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>". Save the lights'.
</line><line>Apollo:
True, there wasn't a <textEffects>switch</textEffects> at the scene. But, it just so happens... I have a "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>" right here.
</line><line>Judge:
That certainly does look like a <textEffects>switch</textEffects>, doesn't it.
</line><line>Apollo:
The problem is... ...this was found not at the scene of the crime, but on the stage.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>The stage</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Where the concert was held, yes. This was found hidden there!
</line><line>Klavier:
On the stage...
</line><line>Judge:
Are you claiming that the voice Lamiroir heard... ...was of someone commanding another to press this switch?
</line><line>Apollo:
...It's a possibility.

</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, Herr Forehead? I'd call that an "impossibility".
</line><line>Apollo:
...Why?
</line><line>Klavier:
It's hardly necessary for me to remind the court of the layout of the concert forum. The stage is quite far from Lamiroir's dressing room. Not to mention that the Gavinners were in the middle of a concert on said stage. We aren't known for being a quiet band. You could shout all you wanted and not be heard.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
The detective's voice was loud... but certainly not a shout.
</line><line>Klavier:
So, too, have Herr Forehead's cries of "possibility" fallen far short of being heard...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Excuse me?
</line><line>Apollo:
You heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple <textEffects>to be heard</textEffects> on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this! Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?
</line><line>Klavier:
! Wh-Why that's...
</line><line>Judge:
What? What is it!? Is that some kind of new-fangled phone they invented while I wasn't looking!?
</line><line>Apollo:
This is a type of transmitter. A communications device.
</line><line>Judge:
Communications? Device?
</line><line>Apollo:
From what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, yes, actually. They're for talking between band members. We all had one on.
</line><line>Apollo:
So you admit that if you were wearing one of these... ...talking from the backstage to the stage would be simple!
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
True, but wait! Those send out an electronic signal. To avoid interference with the audio systems, their range is quite limited.
</line><line>Trucy:
Lamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Look at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah...
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!
</line><line>Klavier:
That... can't be...
</line><line>Judge:
So, when Lamiroir heard the <textEffects>shooter's voice</textEffects>... ...he could have been talking to someone <textEffects>on stage</textEffects>!
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
Hah! You're claiming this is the "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>" in question? Why did it have to be on the stage at the time? It could be placed in a pocket and carried anywhere! Someone could have hid it on the stage after the fact!
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said "<textEffects>press the switch</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, I guess we don't...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... An unfortunate situation. I'm afraid that until we know where this switch was, there's little point in debating it.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ugh... <textEffects>(I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
What is this <textEffects>switch</textEffects>, anyway? We don't even know that basic fact.
</line><line>Apollo:
...... <textEffects>(Wait a second... I do know what this "<span style="color:#E16935">switch</textEffects>" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible <textEffects>conclusion</textEffects>... ...it ends up in <textEffects>proof</textEffects> that completely changes this case!)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
What's up, Apollo? Apollo...?
</line><line>Apollo:
We know about this "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>", right? We know what it is.
</line><line>Trucy:
Y...Yeah?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well... think of when it was used that day... Think of what <textEffects>happened</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? If you have no further information to share concerning this switch...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
I've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>" is.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, it seems the defense is set upon linking this switch to the case. Let's see your evidence of the link! What evidence do you have to explain what this "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>" is?
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ach! That's that...
</line><line>Judge:
That what!? Is it another one of those new-fangled phones!?
</line><line>Apollo:
This... is an igniter. <textEffects>(What phone looks like this!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I-I-Igniter? You mean it's like a <textEffects>lighter</textEffects>?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, actually.
</line><line>Klavier:
You aren't saying this switch is a remote...?
</line><line>Apollo:
I am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.
</line><line>Klavier:
What...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Look, I'll show you.
</line><line>Judge:
.................. Yow yow yow yow yow! Mr. Justice! You will cease and desist from burning down this courtroom!
</line><line>Apollo:
Er, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.
</line><line>Judge:
If my whiskers had caught on fire...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Doesn't that suggest something to you?
</line><line>Klavier:
You're... talking about what happened to me, aren't you?
</line><line>Trucy:
Ah...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual <textEffects>burst of flame</textEffects>. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!
</line><line>Judge:
Wasn't that part of the <textEffects>stage show</textEffects>, though?
</line><line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable <textEffects>keepsake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.
</line><line>Klavier:
The better the guitar, the brighter it burns. Herr Forehead!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?
</line><line>Klavier:
Don't tell me you're trying to tie these <textEffects>two things</textEffects> together? Those being the <textEffects>shooter's voice</textEffects>, heard by Lamiroir... ...and the guitar suddenly <textEffects>catching on fire</textEffects>?
</line><line>Apollo:
I am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to "<textEffects>press the switch</textEffects>". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, that does seem to make sense... Though something about it is bugging me. Can't quite put my finger on it...
</line><line>Apollo:
Really? It seems pretty simple to me.
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Forehead, don't destroy what little respect I have for you!
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
I was expecting something a little more... sensible. I guess I was wrong.
</line><line>Judge:
What's this all about, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
His simple story simply makes no sense. Think! That night, my guitar caught fire, yes. The cause... may have been this, indeed. However! The guitar caught fire during the second set!
</line><line>Trucy:
Ack! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!
</line><line>Klavier:
Indeed. Yet the shooting happened during the third set. The two are utterly unrelated!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, yes, that must have been what was bugging me. The whole premise for this is faulty!
</line><line>Klavier:
See? His story makes no sense.

</line><line>Apollo:
Are you sure about that?
</line><line>Judge:
...! What exactly do you mean, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Maybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!
</line><line>Judge:
What <textEffects>premise</textEffects> is this, specifically?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!

What's this? But Detective Ema Skye heard shots and found the body. All of this happened in the third act!

</line><line>Apollo:
Gunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.
</line><line>Judge:
Where are you going with this, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Stay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!
</line><line>Klavier:
This... This is insane!
</line><line>Apollo:
Just before the "shooting" took place, the "shooter" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to "<textEffects>press the switch</textEffects>"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!
</line><line>Klavier:
Whaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! B-But that goes against the evidence!
</line><line>Apollo:
...What does, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
This crime was carried out according to the <textEffects>lyrics</textEffects> of that song, yes?
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, he's right! Look! The "<textEffects>bullet</textEffects>" is supposed to come after the "<textEffects>fire</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're thinking about it the wrong way.
</line><line>Trucy:
Huh?
</line><line>Apollo:
Look... Why would the shooter <textEffects>craft</textEffects> the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I'm sure whoever it was had some reason...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, they did. A <textEffects>reason</textEffects> that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.
</line><line>Klavier:
...You're saying the order was <textEffects>reversed</textEffects> on purpose!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? <textEffects>Reversed</textEffects>, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
If the criminal followed the <textEffects>lyrics</textEffects> strictly, then yes... ...the shooting would have had to come <textEffects>after</textEffects> the guitar burst into flame. Yet, Herr Forehead has raised another possibility. He's claiming that the bullet came not after, but <textEffects>just before</textEffects> the "fire".
</line><line>Apollo:
...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the <textEffects>lyrics</textEffects> to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! That would explain this most unusual situation...
</line><line>Apollo:
It does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. But sadly, it has. Let me tell you why your little fairy tale makes no sense at all.
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, it sounds good, I'll give you that. You've given us a reason why the killer bothered following the <textEffects>lyrics</textEffects> of my song. But I question your logic! ...For it's flawed from the very beginning.
</line><line>Apollo:
Flawed?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes. A contradiction, Herr Forehead, one I've pointed out several times, no less. At the time of the crime, the <textEffects>small window</textEffects> at the scene was closed... How could Lamiroir have heard a <textEffects>voice</textEffects> through it?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh...
</line><line>Klavier:
I know that you would like to divert our attention from this critical fact. But you're basing your entire line of reasoning on a false premise!
</line><line>Apollo:
...... <textEffects>(Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
W-What if she <textEffects>couldn't hear it</textEffects>, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Look, what do we have. A man saying "<textEffects>press the switch!</textEffects>" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. <textEffects>(It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
I see a more direct line of questioning is required. When the crime scene was investigated, immediately after the crime... ...that window was closed! Care to tell us how Lamiroir heard the voice?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... A key point, to be sure. ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this to the court?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a "<span style="color:#E16935">voice</textEffects>"... ...and she heard it during the <textEffects>second set</textEffects>! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)</span>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
When we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was <textEffects>impossible</textEffects> to hear the voice through that window.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, it's good to hear you making sense again. For a moment, I was afraid you might be a Borginian, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the <textEffects>voice</textEffects> through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from <textEffects>another location</textEffects> entirely!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What's this...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ha ha ha, you do amuse me so. And here I thought you and good sense were back on speaking terms. Now, I'm afraid you and good sense speak two entirely different languages.
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Shall I interpret for you, Herr Forehead? Lamiroir clearly stated <textEffects>she heard the voice through that small window</textEffects>! And there is only one "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>" at the scene!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Are you sure?
</line><line>Klavier:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
Think about it... Isn't there another "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>" at the scene?
</line><line>Trucy:
Th-There is!?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, I know that look. He wants us to ask him. Very well. You claim Lamiroir heard the voice from another location? Mr. Justice, show us where this location was!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But that's no "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>"! That's the <textEffects>air vent</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
What did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this "<textEffects>air vent</textEffects>" a "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
Now you've done it. You've gone beyond ridiculous and into... ludicrous. So Lamiroir was up in the ventilation system listening to this man's <textEffects>voice</textEffects>?
</line><line>Apollo:
That's the only logical explanation, yes.
</line><line>Klavier:
"Logical"? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!
</line><line>Apollo:
OK, what about it isn't logical?
</line><line>Klavier:
Hah! It hardly merits saying! Why would Lamiroir be in the ventilation system? Hiding like a rat! No offense intended to her, of course.
</line><line>Apollo:
The explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
You have been listening to our discussion here, yes?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...Yes. I admit, it's had me quite confused since yesterday. Yes, the small window was <textEffects>closed</textEffects>... ...but why should that mean I <textEffects>could not hear</textEffects> through it? I feared our prosecutor might himself need an interpreter...
</line><line>Klavier:
Urk...
</line><line>Apollo:
The problem here is words. Lamiroir, this "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...Yes, it was up on the ceiling.
</line><line>Klavier:
Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! I will have order!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...Witness! You will clarify this statement to the court! Are you, in fact, saying that you were up above the ceiling of the room? And that's where you <textEffects>heard</textEffects> the moment of the crime?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Yes, in fact, I was. I am sorry. I never imagined it would become such an important point...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, well... why the heck were you up there!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
......
</line><line>Judge:
I believe it's time for another testimony.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I... I'm not sure I... I can't.
</line><line>Judge:
May I remind you this is a murder trial? We will hear your testimony! Tell us why you "witnessed" the crime from above the ceiling of that room! ...Please.
</line><line>Lamiroir:

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Above the Ceiling --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lamiroir:
Yes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.
I had heard there was a, er, "<textEffects>small window</textEffects>" there before.
It was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.
As to why I was there... I cannot say.
I am <textEffects>bound to secrecy</textEffects> on this matter.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
<textEffects>B-Bound to secrecy</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
In my line of work, one has many obligations to uphold.
</line><line>Judge:
But you say you were in the middle of your performance! So this did happen during the <textEffects>second set</textEffects>!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I did not witness the crime, you must understand. I only know what I heard.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, but you must tell us what you were doing, in detail!
</line><line>Klavier:
That's what the <textEffects>cross-examination</textEffects> is for, ja, Herr Forehead?
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Our mission in this court is to discern the truth. No obligation, no <textEffects>binding pact</textEffects>, may hinder that mission.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.
</line><line>Trucy:
Wh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?
</line><line>Apollo:
...I'm going to find out the truth. <textEffects>(...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)</textEffects>
</line>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Lamiroir, truth be told, the reason for your presence above that ceiling is quite clear. Especially when you consider what happened during your performance.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
What "happened"...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. It's all right here on this video.

<hr />
<line>Lamiroir:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
As we can see, Lamiroir was clearly not on stage for her entire performance!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...
</line><line>Apollo:
Though it saddens me to be so realistic... Lamiroir is incapable of actually vanishing, let alone teleportation. So, the only explanation is that she was hidden from view. And during that time, she moved to the back of the forum.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What, Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
It's not nice to reveal a magician's secrets! And it's against the rules!
</line><line>Apollo:
But I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!
</line><line>Judge:
This... is all very fascinating. But how is it possible? There is only twenty seconds between when she disappears and reappears! She couldn't have moved that fast!
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Judge:
Is... something wrong, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Apollo:
...This was his concert, his show. He knows how the illusion was performed.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah ha!
</line><line>Apollo:
He's just realizing his own oversight. Let's look at the cross-section diagram again. Here, we can trace a route through the ceiling... It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... Aaaaah!
</line><line>Apollo:
Recall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
She went from the stage to the backstage exit... ...a perfect description of this route above the ceiling!
</line><line>Apollo:
Lamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.
</line><line>Klavier:
What...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Just now in the lobby, Machi told me something:
</line>
<hr />
<line>Machi:
I know. I know if I opening vent...  ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
He said that!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
............ I... I knew about the vanishing act, of course. Yet, I had no idea of the route that would be used. Why didn't that magician tell me!
</line><line>Trucy:
Magicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Which is why he <span style="color:#E16935">bound Lamiroir to secrecy</textEffects>...)</span> ...Well, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I am impressed, Mr. Attorney. Machi was right about you.
</line><line>Judge:
So... what does this mean? Are you saying you used this route above the ceiling?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...I did.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, that's that... but I'm still a little confused.
</line><line>Apollo:
Why's that, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
As I said before... There was very little time between when she disappeared and when she reappeared. Twenty seconds, tops! How could she do it so fast? Especially if she stopped to hear the shooter's voice!
</line><line>Apollo:
That... That's a good question.
</line><line>Judge:
Can the witness explain this to the court?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I... cannot.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
It's all up to you. Do your thing.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, what thing, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
You need to explain how Lamiroir was able to teleport like she did. Or I'm throwing your case out with the bathwater.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ugh... <textEffects>(Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lamiroir:
As I have stated before... I am not at liberty to speak of the illusion that night in detail.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, you'll just have to tell us what you can. We'll hear your testimony on this. Mr. Justice, it will be your job to wring the truth out of her.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Yes, if you would, please.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Right. <textEffects>(I feel like a student before finals...)</textEffects>

Good luck, Apollo!

There is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.
From there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.
The plan was for me to move there in two minutes.
I was on my way, when I heard the voice.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Two minutes, you say? The mystery deepens!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)</textEffects>

As does my curiosity! Take it away, Mr. Justice.

...Right, Your Honor. <textEffects>(All I have to do is find the contradiction between what Lamiroir is saying... ...and what we can see plainly in the video.)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Apollo:
You were... singing...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Yes. Mr. Gavin expressed a dislike for recordings... So I used this.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait... so you were singing the whole time? Even when you were crawling above the ceiling toward the backstage!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Why should it matter where I sing, when everywhere I go is the same darkness?
</line><line>Judge:
B-But if you were singing while you were walking...
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right! Wouldn't the shooter and victim have heard? She was singing right over their heads, after all!
</line><line>Apollo:
That... is right!

...Are you sure?

You'd have to be pretty hard of hearing to miss someone singing in the ceiling!
</line><line>Klavier:
Once again we come back to the state of the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Apollo:
What state...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Ack... I know what he means! That old speaker, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
The speaker!?
</line><line>Apollo:
That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...
</line><line>Ema:
Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.
</line><line>Trucy:
Monitoring?
</line><line>Ema:
It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Satisfied? That dressing room was fitted with a large speaker playing a direct feed from the stage. ...At my request, actually.
</line><line>Apollo:
So Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.

Ingenious! Her voice was hidden... by her voice!

Ah...

Lamiroir?

</line><line>Judge:
It does? I must have missed it...
</line><line>Apollo:
Look at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says "<textEffects>Pleasure, Pleasure...</textEffects>"? Now listen again!

Pleasure...But a fleeting melody</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...This is evidence indeed! I believe we are guilty of making a terrible mistake.
</line><line>Apollo:
The crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.
</line><line>Judge:
If that is true... ...then no one on stage during the second set could have been the shooter!
</line><line>Apollo:
Which means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Fascinating.
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line><line>Klavier:
I don't believe I've ever seen a trial turned around quite so thoroughly. ...Yet one problem remains.
</line><line>Judge:
What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Forehead's theory does have a certain kind of logic to it. Yet it is entirely based upon Lamiroir's testimony.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes? Is there a problem with that?
</line><line>Klavier:
Well, it's quite simple, though it pains me to say it. What if she is lying to protect the defendant?
</line><line>Apollo:

But you have no proof...!
</line><line>Klavier:
All I'm saying is that the truth is as yet unclear. ...Until we hear directly from the man himself.
</line><line>Judge:
The man... you don't mean!?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Yes. Though he is a friend, and band member, Daryan Crescend must take the stand. I see no other way.
</line><line>Judge:
As... someone with a new perspective on the case?
</line><line>Klavier:
...As a suspect, to be frank.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
This is as good a time as any to pause for a brief recess. The prosecution will summon the witness. Have him here and ready by the time we begin.

Trucy:
Apollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Why she was in that air vent... ...and that "<textEffects>switch</textEffects>" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.
</line><line>???:
...I knew you had what it took.
</line><line>Trucy:
Ah... Daddy!
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright! You... believed in me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not really.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I just thought that'd make a cooler entrance than, say, "hiya"!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Why do I even bother hoping?
</line><line>Trucy:
Where have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, sorry about that, Trucy. I'm on a... secret mission.
</line><line>Trucy:
Secret? You mean like, you're undercover?
</line><line>Apollo:
Like Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! Would I do a thing like that to you? Anyway, I'm off for a while again.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? You're leaving?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, one thing before I go.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............... Good luck.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Right.
</line><line>Phoenix:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
...... Um... Is that all you came to say?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I think you have things pretty much under control. You'll get Machi Tobaye off the hook, no doubt.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you're after that detective, aren't you?
</line><line>Apollo:
Daryan Crescend...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...
</line><line>Apollo:
The current court system...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What did Prosecutor Gavin say during the trial? Your case is based on one fragile assumption. ...Namely, that our diva divine is telling the truth.
</line><line>Trucy:
But what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A piece of jewelry, and a lyrical blunder... There are plenty of other ways to explain these things. The flaming guitar, too. ...All because you lack definitive proof of their connection to the case.
</line><line>Trucy:
But...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the sultry songstress is lying... ...your case melts like butter in a frying pan. Leaving behind the faintly singed scent of failure.
</line><line>Apollo:
So what do I do!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Like I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ugh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, that reminds me. I have something to give you from our detective friend.
</line><line>Apollo:
Detective Skye... Ema!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's see. This bag of snacks here was meant for me... Ah, here it is.
</line><line>Trucy:
What are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.
</line><line>Phoenix:
They were found at the scene. Analysis of the fragments revealed traces of gunpowder.
</line><line>Trucy:
Gunpowder...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Probably a firecracker or something similar, like the ones kids are into these days. These fragments were found under the sofa at the scene of the crime, actually.
</line><line>Apollo:
Under the sofa...
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!

...Court is now back in session. Prosecutor Gavin, where is Detective Crescend?
</line><line>Klavier:
In the witness lounge, ready to be called at any time.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well.
</line><line>Klavier:
Might I add... I don't believe any of this. He... Daryan was the first detective I ever worked with. We stopped working together when he moved to Criminal Affairs, Division 3... But his guitar playing... it fires my imagination!
</line><line>Apollo:
That's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, I know. ...Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, call the final witness to the stand! ...Detective Daryan Crescend!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...Name and occupation, please.
</line><line>Daryan:
Daryan Crescend. Detective, Criminal Affairs, Division 3. That's the International Affairs Division, for those of you who didn't know. ...And I'm a guitarist for the Gavinners. Maybe you've heard of us?
</line><line>Judge:
Do you fully understand the circumstances under which you stand before us today?
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah, I understand, Your Honor. What I don't understand... is how you let this happen, "partner".
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Daryan:
You gave me your word I wouldn't be standing here.
</line><line>Klavier:
The situation's changed, Daryan... And don't call me "partner".
</line><line>Daryan:
Feh. So much for old friends.
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're "pressing" the prosecution!)</textEffects> ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, it's high time we did. Let's hear your testimony. You may begin with your response to Lamiroir's testimony. If, in fact you have anything to say about it.
</line><line>Daryan:
Oh I got plenty to say. Lying must be a national pastime in Borginia. ...And wherever you're from, Mr. "Justice". Hah!

In the first place, she never heard my voice!
She "forgot the words because she heard gunshots"? As if!
Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?
The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So you claim Lamiroir's testimony was a lie?
</line><line>Daryan:
Hey, don't get me wrong, I dig what she's doing, trying to protect that kid. And she's got the court eating vague statements out of her hand just 'cause she's blind.
</line><line>Klavier:
...You go too far, Daryan.
</line><line>Daryan:
Look, all I'm saying is, you've got a reliable witness. Why not listen to the detective?
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Skye...? Hmm... I see. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.
</line><line>Apollo:

<line>Judge:
...I did hear something faintly there, yes! Why... it sounded like a gunshot!
</line><line>Daryan:
Wh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!
</line><line>Klavier:
Or... the sound was coming over the headset along with her voice.
</line><line>Daryan:
Gavin... You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?
</line><line>Klavier:
Perhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.
</line><line>Apollo:
Admit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!
</line><line>Daryan:
OK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were "mistaken"!
</line><line>Judge:
Were you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
No, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Apollo:
And I have evidence that proves it!
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Then I think you'd best show it to the court. Let's see this evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
If you would, Mr. Justice!

The evidence showing what we really heard... is this!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.
</line><line>Judge:
What things?
</line><line>Apollo:
The first was this small device...
</line><line>Klavier:
...That's the remote-triggered igniter.
</line><line>Apollo:
Correct. And... one more thing.
</line><line>Judge:
What are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Traces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh... <textEffects>(How did Gavin know about this...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
What? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.
</line><line>Judge:
What decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
I registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
This raises another possibility. Those <textEffects>gunshot-like sounds</textEffects> during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!
</line><line>Daryan:
Ha ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.
</line><line>Apollo:
How so?
</line><line>Daryan:
So, you're saying these <textEffects>firecrackers</textEffects> just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?
</line><line>Daryan:
If a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk...! <textEffects>(How do I explain this...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.
</line><line>Daryan:
"He may not look it", partner? Gee, thanks, man.
</line><line>Klavier:
...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.
</line><line>Apollo:
Something... odd?
</line><line>Klavier:
A headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
What if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?
</line><line>Apollo:
You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!
</line><line>Daryan:
Feh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Listen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.

I believe a case has been made. Gunshots were heard during the second set. Which means Lamiroir's testimony... was true.
</line><line>Daryan:
...Grah!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! So... she was telling the truth about what she heard?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lamiroir:
It was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, what did he say!?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
"<textEffects>It's over. Press the switch! Now!</textEffects>"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Just after that, there was a gunshot... and then the guitar caught on fire.
</line><line>Klavier:
Detective Crescend... You weren't on stage during the second set. You could have done it.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But why did we only hear one gunshot on the recording? Weren't two bullets fired from this weapon?
</line><line>Apollo:
Lamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, once again I am reminded of something.
</line><line>Apollo:
...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Our performance that day...
</line><line>Judge:
Your performance?
</line><line>Klavier:
Seeing the mixing board jogged my memory. You were there, too, Herr Forehead.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
What is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung! My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
This part is off.
</line><line>Klavier:
Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.
</line><line>Daryan:
Ah.
</line><line>Klavier:
It was you Daryan!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...I thought it strange at the time. How could you miss such a simple cue? I know you, I know how you play. You're better than that.
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah, well, I...
</line><line>Judge:
You what? And Prosecutor Gavin, what are you getting at?
</line><line>Klavier:
I'm talking about the murder weapon. Mr. LeTouse's 45-caliber hand cannon. As we have learned, even the shooter doesn't go unscarred with a revolver that size. The kickback is enough to dislocate your shoulder, if you're an amateur.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?
</line><line>Daryan:
Hah! You're forgetting something.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Detective Crescend...?
</line><line>Daryan:
I am a trained police officer, you know. I've had firearms training. Plenty of it. I'm no amateur.
</line><line>Klavier:
The standard sidearm issued to police officers is a 38-caliber weapon. A much tamer beast. Also, the murder weapon belonged to the victim, Mr. LeTouse. ...Which suggests there was a struggle between killer and victim.
</line><line>Judge:
So... the killer might not have been holding the revolver correctly when he fired! Is that what you mean!?
</line><line>Klavier:
...The thought had occurred to me, yes.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, does the witness have anything to say to this?
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Crescend!!!
</line><line>Daryan:
What I want to ask is what Mr. Sleeves-rolled-up-ready-for-action has to say. Hey, you. Attorney.
</line><line>Apollo:
Me?
</line><line>Daryan:
Exactly which piece of your evidence is decisive, again? You got a little noise on a tape that could be anything. And you have an alleged guitar cue miss due to a 45-caliber kickback. I weep for this case, Gavin, I really do.
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Daryan:
You can line up your little weak pieces of evidence all you want. I didn't shoot that manager. And that's the obvious truth.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... The witness has a point. The defense's arguments, while persuasive, are not decisive. I believe we should hear what the witness has to say in response to the case so far. ...Your testimony, please, Detective Crescend. Tell us your reasons why you couldn't have done it!

</line><line>Daryan:
...Looks like a piece of candy.
</line><line>Apollo:
What it is... is evidence. Don't lick it before you try it.
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Specifically, this is a replica of a <textEffects>cocoon</textEffects>... ...It was found among the victim's belongings.
</line><line>Judge:
A cocoon? Never seen one that color.
</line><line>Klavier:
It is a variety only found in the Republic of Borginia. Nowhere else.
</line><line>Judge:
Alright... But what is this cocoon replica doing in my courtroom? Surely, this has nothing to do with a motive for killing Mr. LeTouse! ...Does it?
</line><line>Apollo:
It does! ...Wait! I mean, I think it does.
</line><line>Daryan:
...You don't sound so confident, man.
</line><line>Judge:
A cocoon... Is it one of those silky cocoons? The kind that you can make, well, silk out of?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful "<textEffects>curative</textEffects>".
</line><line>Judge:
A curative? For what...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Apparently, it is most efficacious at treating a <textEffects>disease thought incurable</textEffects>. It is the only medicine of its kind. ...However, it is illegal to take one of these healing cocoons out of Borginia.
</line><line>Judge:
Whatever for? If it's such a miracle cure, why not share it with the world?
</line><line>Trucy:
Yeah, that's what I've been wondering!
</line><line>Klavier:
We looked into the matter at some length. Apparently, it isn't difficult at all to manufacture the remedy from the cocoon. Yet, if you change the process only slightly... ...you can easily make a large quantity of something else entirely. ...A deadly poison, in fact.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Klavier:
There was an incident, several years ago, where some of these got out onto the black market. It caused quite the commotion in the global community. Though the media was kept largely unaware.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Intriguing!
</line><line>Klavier:
All this has led to a strict ban on the cocoons' export. One rigidly enforced... by Interpol, among others.
</line><line>Judge:
Interpol...
</line><line>Apollo:
Right! The victim, Romein LeTouse, was an Interpol agent. Detective Crescend! You insist on referring to him as a "manager"... But that is misleading! Romein LeTouse wasn't killed as a manager! He was killed as an <textEffects>undercover agent</textEffects>!
</line><line>Daryan:
...... So I was trying to <textEffects>smuggle</textEffects> this gumball into the country? That what you're trying to say?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm saying that could well be a <textEffects>motive</textEffects> for murder.
</line><line>Daryan:
Oh, so I was going to sell it on the black market, make myself a pretty penny? ...Ridiculous. I mean, totally unthinkable.
</line><line>Apollo:
"Unthinkable", you say? Why?
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps it's time for another testimony... ...about this "<textEffects>smuggling of cocoons</textEffects>" business!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Cocoon Smuggling --</textEffects></center>
<line>Daryan:
International Affairs got a memo about these cocoons.
Interpol's all hot and bothered about 'em.
Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.
Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.
Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Indeed... Interpol wanted these cocoons bad enough to send Mr. LeTouse undercover.
</line><line>Daryan:
You kids think up the craziest things... But no way am I going to risk life and limb... ...just to get my hands on some dirty cocoon money!
</line><line>Judge:
Not the most noble of statements, but duly noted.
</line><line>Klavier:
According to reports, these cocoons top Interpol's list. Selling them to an underground organization would be risky.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This is the only <span style="color:#E16935">motive</textEffects> I've got... He was up to something, and I'm going to find out what!)</span>

<line>Daryan:

<textEffects>Borginian Customs is very thorough. Everything and everyone gets checked.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Daryan:
<textEffects>Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.</textEffects>

<line>Daryan:

<line>Daryan:
<textEffects>Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Daryan:
<textEffects>Hey, man, if there's a way to get cocoons out of there, I'd sure like to know.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...The replica has to be the key to his <span style="color:#E16935">motive</textEffects>... There's got to be a way to find out what he was up to!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Actually, there is one way.
</line><line>Daryan:
Whaa--!?
</line><line>Apollo:
One way to get something out of the country, no checks.
</line><line>Judge:
What is it!?
</line><line>Apollo:
...You become a prosecutor.
</line><line>Judge:
A prosecutor!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaah! I don't believe it...
</line><line>Apollo:
Believe it, Prosecutor Gavin. What was it that you told me yesterday at your office?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years. A guitar befitting a woman like Lamiroir.
</line><line>Trucy:
How did it end up here?
</line><line>Klavier:
I mentioned how much I enjoyed playing it that night, and she made a present of it.
</line><line>Trucy:
So this guitar is from Borginia?
</line><line>Klavier:
That it is. We couldn't carry it on the plane. Changes in air pressure and humidity ruin the wood. So, we vacuum packed it in Lamiroir's studio. I used a special shipping service available to me for transporting evidence. They brought it right up to my office for me. ...Pristine and untouched.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Did I get that right, Prosecutor Gavin? "<textEffects>Untouched</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Quite. The guitar was wrapped in several sheets and vacuum packed in Borginia. The pack was untouched until the day of the concert. Are you saying that guitar was...
</line><line>Apollo:
With cocoons this small, it would've been very easy... ...to use your guitar as a mule to smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Which reminds me, Prosecutor Gavin. That guitar had some "<textEffects>work</textEffects>" done on it recently, right?
</line><line>Judge:
Work...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Good memory, Herr Forehead.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
Well, you know how guitars have a round hole in the front? It is called the "sound hole". Well, they found something attached to the wood just inside the hole. ...A broken device of some sort.
</line><line>Trucy:
A broken... device?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes. This, in fact.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
An igniter...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. Consider this, if you will. What if that <textEffects>igniter</textEffects> wasn't the only thing that was attached inside your guitar?
</line><line>Trucy:
You... You mean...
</line><line>Klavier:
He means this, of course.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah. Aaaaaaaah...!
</line><line>Apollo:
There was a way to get a cocoon out of the country! They could use picky Prosecutor Gavin's privileged guitar as a mule!
</line><line>Daryan:
!
</line><line>Apollo:
And who better to do that than someone with access... ...like a member of the band!
</line><line>Daryan:
Yooooooooooooooooowrk!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! So the igniter...
</line><line>Klavier:
...Was placed in there for a clear reason, it seems.
</line><line>Apollo:
It was a <textEffects>safety precaution</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
A precaution...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ahh... Herr Forehead. At last, it all comes together.
</line><line>Apollo:
Every strange thing that happened that day. Care to review? Maestro, the gentle sounds of Lamiroir's ballad, if you please.
</line><line>Klavier:
First... my keys were stolen. A harmless misdemeanor. Which forced me to break the lock on my guitar case.
</line><line>Apollo:
The key was stolen to retrieve the <textEffects>cocoon</textEffects> from the guitar.
</line><line>Judge:
I... I see...
</line><line>Apollo:
But... things didn't go so well. The smuggler wasn't counting on the guitar being wrapped! Only a member of the band could get near that case. Unwrapping the guitar would raise too many suspicions. ...Then the concert began. Right about this time... ...a very large problem presented itself to the smuggler.
</line><line>Judge:
What's that?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Mr. LeTouse, an undercover agent, was on to something. He would have known about the guitar. He'd only have to check the shipping records. So... Mr. LeTouse tried to examine the guitar himself.
</line><line>Apollo:
If the cocoon were confiscated then, the gig would be up. The only thing left for the smuggler to do was to <textEffects>get rid of</textEffects> the whole lot.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>...It's over. Press the switch! Now!...</textEffects></center>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The guitar burst into flames, and the cocoon... was <textEffects>lost</textEffects>. And then... Mr. LeTouse died.
</line><line>Klavier:
With Lamiroir there to "<textEffects>witness</textEffects>" it.
</line><line>Apollo:
There's your case.
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Judge:
......
</line><line>Trucy:
......
</line><line>Daryan:
Eh heh. Heh heh ha ha! Brilliant, man!
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Crescend...?
</line><line>Daryan:
I gotta know, you make all that up on the fly?
</line><line>Klavier:
For a made-up story... ...it makes a great deal of sense... Daryan.
</line><line>Daryan:
Feh! The Republic of Borginia? Sorry, man, but I haven't even been there.
</line><line>Klavier:
True, you haven't.
</line><line>Daryan:
Hah! Let's see you make up a story for that, kid! How'd I hide the cocoon in the first place, huh?
</line><line>Apollo:
It's not so hard to imagine. You had help. A Borginian <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>. ...That's all.
</line><line>Daryan:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
That you had an <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects> was clear from the start! The <textEffects>voice</textEffects> Lamiroir heard proves it!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>...It's over. Press the switch! Now!...</textEffects></center>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
You made this <textEffects>transmission</textEffects> from backstage.
</line><line>Klavier:
While your <textEffects>co-conspirator</textEffects> was on stage!
</line><line>Judge:
But... But who was it!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This is it, the coup de grâce! And for once I know what I'm doing... There's only one person <span style="color:#E16935">who could have helped him</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Justice has to say, then. But be warned. With a great <textEffects>accusation</textEffects> comes great responsibility. Make up your answer "on the fly" as it were, and you'll be harshly penalized! ...Are you ready, Mr. Justice? Who was the smuggler's <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>!?
</line>



<line>Apollo:
There is only one person who meets all the requirements of the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>... ...and that person is the defendant, Machi Tobaye!
</line><line>Judge:
But... Mr. Justice... He's your client!
</line><line>Daryan:
A defense attorney accusing his client? That's a new one!
</line><line>Apollo:
I assure you, no one is more unhappy about this than I. But, I am here to defend him in the murder of Mr. LeTouse. And I stand by my statement earlier that he is innocent of that particular crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... the defendant is Borginian. He does meet the basic requirements to be the accomplice. But, what if it was, in fact, Lamiroir?
</line><line>Apollo:
It couldn't have been.
</line><line>Judge:
...Well, you seem sure of yourself.
</line><line>Apollo:
The reason... is <textEffects>electronic signals</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Electronic signals...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Recall that this remote only works to a range of 30 feet. Beyond that, it's useless.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that's true.
</line><line>Apollo:
Now, think back to the testimony... When the shooter made his transmission, Lamiroir was in the air vent. Right above the dressing room where the shooter stood. Let's look at the stage diagram! This is the area that the remote could reach from the air vent.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, looking at this... ...it seems that Lamiroir still could have done the deed.
</line><line>Apollo:
No. When the shooter made that transmission... ...the stage was slightly different than shown here. It was in the middle of "<textEffects>The Guitar's Serenade</textEffects>". Part of the stage... was raised. Prosecutor Gavin and the Lamiroir stand-in were in the air! They were on a <textEffects>tower</textEffects> which happens to be 15 feet tall! In other words! The remote couldn't have worked from Lamiroir's position in the air vent!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Daryan:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Detective Crescend? What do you say to that?
</line><line>Daryan:
...Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, Detective?
</line><line>Daryan:
Could we see the video where Gavin's guitar burns? Just one more time?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah? Ah... Well. I don't see why not.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wh-What? Don't tell me he has a way out of this!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center>Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.</center>
<hr />
<line>Daryan:
...Ah ha ha ha ha! Too bad, so sad... punk!
</line><line>Apollo:
P-Punk...?
</line><line>Trucy:
First you were "Sleeves", then "kid", now "punk". You're losing rank fast, Apollo!
</line><line>Judge:
What exactly were we supposed to see in this video?
</line><line>Klavier:
...The problem isn't in what we "see". Correct, Daryan?
</line><line>Daryan:
Right. It's what you <textEffects>hear</textEffects>. We are musicians after all.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Care to explain for us non-musicians?
</line><line>Daryan:
Sure thing, punk. Let me get your yarn straight first: You're saying I ordered the wee pianist to set off that igniter? That right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes...?
</line><line>Daryan:
Well in order to do that, he'd have to press a switch. Am I right?
</line><line>Apollo:
...OK...
</line><line>Daryan:
Well, take another listen. Pay attention to the piano.
</line><line>Apollo:
Piano...?
</line>
<hr />
<center>Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
What seems to be the problem there? The piano sounded just fine.
</line><line>Daryan:
And that's the problem! Man, you still don't get it?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah...!
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah. How's he supposed to hit that switch if he's playing? You've got Ms. Diva, the guitar, the bass, the piano, and the drums... The only one with her hands free was the diva!
</line><line>Trucy:
Lamiroir...
</line><line>Daryan:
But according to you... ...she couldn't have been the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>, could she?
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk...!
</line><line>Daryan:
Your <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects> would have had a hard time helping out... ...if they couldn't even press a switch!
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh... Uuuuuuuuuurrrrgh! <textEffects>(The piano plays non-stop! He couldn't have pressed that switch...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? The piano does seem to be playing when the guitar catches fire.
</line><line>Apollo:
W-Well...
</line><line>Daryan:
It's OK. We all make mistakes sometimes.
</line><line>Trucy:
A-Apollo!? Were you wrong?
</line><line>Apollo:
I can't be wrong! Everything makes perfect sense! How could it all... just...
</line><line>Klavier:
...Strange.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What's strange?
</line><line>Klavier:
No, it's just... Something's <textEffects>odd</textEffects> about the performance there.
</line><line>Apollo:
..."<textEffects>Odd</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice. If Machi Tobaye didn't press that switch... ...then he could not be the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects> you claim he is.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But everything points to it! Every fact says he's the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>!
</line><line>Daryan:
...You got the facts wrong, man.
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line><line>Daryan:
Here're some facts for you: Gavin's guitar is on fire. But the pianist didn't press that switch. In other words, your story is full of holes.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, let's hear your final opinion on this matter now. Was the defendant, Machi Tobaye, the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>? Your answer will reflect on everything you've said here. Give it some thought.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! If Machi's not the <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>... ...then our whole case is ruined!
</line><line>Apollo:
I know that! It has to be him... He was the only one who could have helped the <textEffects>smuggler</textEffects>... He had to have pressed that switch!
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, you'd better find a way to prove it!
</line><line>Apollo:
Argh! What do I do... What do I do!?
</line><line>Trucy:
Ack... There has to be something that doesn't fit! ...Something odd.
</line><line>Apollo:
Something odd...! Wait a second...
</line><line>Trucy:
Wh-What? You thought of something!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What was Gavin saying just now...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...Strange.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What's strange?
</line><line>Klavier:
No, it's just... Something's <textEffects>odd</textEffects> about the performance there.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...It's not much to go on, but it's all I've got! What exactly did he hear that was "<span style="color:#E16935">odd</textEffects>"?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Have you come up with something, Mr. Justice? May I remind you that everything rests on this. Can you prove <textEffects>Machi Tobaye pressed that switch</textEffects>? Let's hear your final answer! Can you prove that Machi Tobaye pressed that switch?
</line>


<line>Klavier:
Then, as prosecutor, it falls to me to ask you to show us evidence supporting this. Herr Forehead. You're sure about this?
</line><line>Daryan:
Hah! Accept it! There's no evidence, man!
</line><line>Judge:
Let's see your evidence, Mr. Justice. On what do you base your claim that the defendant pressed that switch?
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The basis for my claim... is <textEffects>music</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Music? What about music?
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's listen to the piano part, around the time when the switch was to be pressed... ...right before the guitar burst into flame.
</line>
<hr />
<center>Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... I hear a piano being played.
</line><line>Apollo:
But... doesn't it sound kind of <textEffects>simple</textEffects>?
</line><line>Judge:
Simple...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, I think I know what he's suggesting. You think Machi could have played that part... with one hand?
</line><line>Judge:
One hand...!?
</line><line>Apollo:
He only needed one hand to press that switch! He could play the piano with the other!
</line><line>Daryan:
Hah! What, so you're some kind of piano savant?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, actually no.
</line><line>Daryan:
Then what do you know!? You can't play a part like that with one hand!
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk...! <textEffects>(Maybe... I don't know what I'm talking about here.)</textEffects> Wait! I know! Hey, Trucy!
</line><line>Trucy:
Yeah? You got something?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright, your father, he's a pianist! Could he...
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, Daddy? He couldn't play a part like that even if he had three hands!
</line><line>Daryan:
So sorry... So sad for you.
</line><line>Apollo:
...... ...No. Not really.
</line><line>Daryan:
H-Huh...?
</line><line>Apollo:
That was just the easy way to prove it. There's always the hard way.
</line><line>Daryan:
Man... How are you going to prove whether he played it with one hand or two!? You can't!
</line><line>Apollo:
I admit, it will be rather difficult to prove. But it's highly likely he was playing with one hand.
</line><line>Daryan:
H-How do you know that?
</line><line>Apollo:
The clue is what Prosecutor Gavin described as sounding "<textEffects>odd</textEffects>".
</line><line>Daryan:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
What sounded odd? I'll bet we can tell by listening to a certain part of the song.
</line><line>Daryan:
No... No way.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it seems we've come to the moment of truth at last. Let's hear what Mr. Justice has to say for himself. Show us the part that proves the defendant was playing with one hand... ...right before the guitar burst into flame!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Machi was definitely playing one-handed just before the guitar caught fire! And <span style="color:#E16935">one section</textEffects> of the song proves it!)</span>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin... I'm sure you've realized by now... ...just what it was that sounded "<textEffects>odd</textEffects>" to you.
</line><line>Klavier:
As I'm sure you've realized it yourself, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Judge:
R-Realized what?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'll demonstrate. Let's listen to the part in question again, shall we? Pay particular attention to the "<textEffects>But a fleeting melody</textEffects>" phrase.
</line>
<hr />
<center>Pleasure...But a fleeting <textEffects>melody</textEffects></center>
<hr />
<line>Daryan:
Man, man, man! How many times do we have to listen to the same thing?
</line><line>Apollo:
You're right. Enough of that!
</line><line>Daryan:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's listen to another section, shall we?
</line><line>Judge:
Another section...?
</line><line>Apollo:
The guitar burst into flame at the end of the <textEffects>second verse</textEffects>. Let's listen to the same spot... in the <textEffects>first verse</textEffects>. Pay attention to "<textEffects>O that night in your embrace</textEffects>"...!
</line>
<hr />
<center>Sugar, Sugar...O that night, <textEffects>in your embrace</textEffects>.</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Ah...! P-Play <textEffects>verse two</textEffects> again!
</line>
<hr />
<center>Pleasure...But a fleeting melody</center>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
There! Did you hear that?
</line><line>Judge:
They "feel" the same, true... ...but they're clearly very different!
</line><line>Daryan:
Whaaat!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well put, Your Honor! The phrase in <textEffects>verse two</textEffects> is quite simple... But the same phrase in <textEffects>verse one</textEffects> has high and low notes! You'd have to use two hands to play that for sure!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Daryan:
Urk... Hrrah! Wh-What's that prove!?
</line><line>Apollo:
I would think you'd know that by now.
</line><line>Daryan:
This is why I hate dealing with amateurs, man... So the <textEffects>two verses</textEffects> had different arrangements! Happens all the time.
</line><line>Klavier:
Not this time, Daryan.
</line><line>Daryan:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
There's no point in changing an arrangement if you can't hear it clearly. And that wasn't the point. I had him play specifically so that the piano would stay in the background.
</line><line>Daryan:
Oh. Ohhhhh!
</line><line>Klavier:
That was what I noticed. "Why should the same phrase sound slightly different?" I asked myself.
</line><line>Apollo:
Now ask yourselves why Machi changed how he played... and there's only one answer! He needed a <textEffects>free hand</textEffects> in order to <textEffects>press the switch</textEffects>!
</line><line>Daryan:
Unh... Unnnnoooooooooork!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!! Order!!!!! I believe this ties all the facts together... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes, quite. Though, personally, this comes as a terrible disappointment.
</line><line>Daryan:
...Heh...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What? No comeback...? I can't believe it! I finally did it! I shut him up!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Barring an objection from the prosecution... I will now state the court's opinion on this matter...
</line><line>Daryan:
Heh... Heh heh heh... Ah ha ha ha ha ha haaaah! Good show, Sleeves. No, great show!
</line><line>Apollo:
...It's not over? <textEffects>(I don't like it when he looks so... so happy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Daryan:
You tell him Gavin. Tell him what's so disappointing!
</line><line>Klavier:
Personally, I'm terribly disappointed... ...in you, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh... M-Me!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes. Don't get me wrong, your case is solid. The facts all check out. But, even now... ...you have yet to show us a single piece of <textEffects>decisive evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but the facts... Anyone can see it was him!
</line><line>Judge:
Unfortunately, "anyone" does not include the law. I'm afraid your case doesn't cut it.
</line><line>Apollo:
But... But...
</line><line>Judge:
A thousand facts might point toward the same conclusion... ...but without decisive evidence, it's not proof. That's the rule under our current legal system.
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't believe it...!
</line><line>Judge:
It does not seem as though the defense has any more evidence to present.
</line><line>Daryan:
Oh, I think if he did we already would have seen it a long ways back.
</line><line>Judge:
It is unfortunate... ...but, at present, this court is unable to acknowledge your accusation.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaat!? <textEffects>(The truth is staring us all right in the face! Why can't they see it!? What's the point of a legal system that protects criminals!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! Remember what Daddy said?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
It won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...
</line><line>Apollo:
So what do I do!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Like I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ugh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Every man has an igniter inside him. Find Daryan Crescend's <textEffects>igniter</textEffects>... and set it off.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
I wonder what he meant by every man's "<textEffects>igniter</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Apollo:
I think he just meant a <textEffects>weak spot</textEffects>, no? The kind of thing that a single spark could turn into a wildfire of emotion... <textEffects>(I won't be able to press him further by conventional means... I've got to find a weak spot in this guy... Something <span style="color:#E16935">fatal</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Daryan:
...So, can I get back to work now, or what? It may look like I got a lot of time on my hands... ...but I got no more time to play pretend with this deadweight attorney.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Justice? We've come this far without decisive evidence... ...This witness won't be coming back to the stand once we let him go.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Every man has an <textEffects>igniter</textEffects>.
</line><line>Daryan:
Huh...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Didn't you say "the better the guitar, the brighter it burns", Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, yes. Good guitars are kept dry, is why. That provides the best sound.
</line><line>Apollo:
Even a small spark could cause irreparable damage. Your plan has an "<textEffects>igniter</textEffects>" in it, too, Detective. ...It was there from the very beginning.
</line><line>Daryan:
What...?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Fightin' time, Justice. If you blow this one... ...he'll be out of your hands for good...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Go for it, Apollo!
</line><line>Daryan:
What, and this <textEffects>igniter</textEffects>'s supposed to come "burn" me up? That's almost poetic there, Mr. Attorney.
</line><line>Klavier:
All the better. I'm rather fond of poetry... And I intend to hear this one through to the very end.
</line><line>Daryan:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Forehead. You are <textEffects>accusing</textEffects> this man, Daryan Crescend of two crimes: The murder of Mr. LeTouse, and the smuggling of a Borginian Cocoon. ...This is your last chance to prove your case.
</line><line>Judge:
This trial has already run on for far too long. Mr. Justice, this will be my last warning. The moment this "<textEffects>igniter</textEffects>" of yours turns out to be a dud... ...is the moment this cross-examination ends. ...Understood?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, let's have it. Show us the basis for these <textEffects>accusations</textEffects> against Daryan Crescend!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(OK... This is really my <span style="color:#E16935">last chance</textEffects>! The key that will take apart Daryan Crescend's plan is...)</span>
</line>

<line>Judge:
...This is your <textEffects>igniter</textEffects>?
</line><line>Daryan:
Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! So, exactly how am I suppose <i>[sic]</i> to react to that?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ack! He's not flustered at all! I picked a dud...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
I'm afraid your poetic tale ended up to be mere fantasy.
</line><line>Judge:
...Reality bites, Mr. Justice. Penalty!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ow ow ow...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I suppose we should let you try once more... Show us the basis for your <textEffects>accusations</textEffects> against Daryan Crescend!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Think, Justice! Are you sure about this...?)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
The one person who can prove Daryan Crescend's guilt... ...is the defendant, Machi Tobaye!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Your client? Again!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Machi Tobaye was an accomplice to the cocoon smuggling plot. Without him, Daryan Crescend could not have gotten the cocoon. Furthermore, he can easily prove that the one who plotted to smuggle that cocoon... ...is the real criminal in this case!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... How so?
</line><line>Apollo:
It would require just one of the very <textEffects>cocoons</textEffects> Mr. LeTouse was looking for. With the cooperation of the Republic of Borginia, we could burn a cocoon. The burnt cocoon would leave a particular residue. A residue we would, no doubt, also find inside the burnt-out guitar!
</line><line>Judge:
Aha! Very scientific of you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Thus, if Machi Tobaye acknowledges his agreement with Daryan Crescend... ...concerning the attempted smuggling of a Borginian Cocoon... ...the case is solved!
</line><line>Daryan:
Heh... Heh heh heh heh heh!
</line><line>Trucy:
Um, Daryan's laughing again...
</line><line>Daryan:
Your unrelenting passion is... remarkable. You really want to get me, don't you? ...Too bad you'll never be able to.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Why not?
</line><line>Daryan:
The little key-tickler won't acknowledge anything! Especially not anything to do with <textEffects>cocoon smuggling</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What's this all about?
</line><line>Klavier:
<textEffects>Taking a cocoon out of the country means death</textEffects>... ...by Borginian law.
</line><line>Trucy:
Ah...
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah! See? If our pianist really was a smuggler... ...then testifying about it would be suicide! ...Believe me, he's not talking--
</line><line>Apollo:
But you're wrong, Detective Crescend.
</line><line>Daryan:
...What...?
</line><line>Apollo:
It's the <textEffects>other way around</textEffects>! If Machi doesn't admit to <textEffects>smuggling</textEffects> here... He's in deep trouble!
</line><line>Daryan:
Huh? H-How?
</line><line>Apollo:
Look, if Machi admits to <textEffects>smuggling</textEffects> here... ...then he'll be tried in our courts, by our laws. You don't get the death penalty for smuggling in our country.
</line><line>Daryan:
Ah...
</line><line>Apollo:
The victim in this case was an undercover Interpol agent. I'm sure that news has already reached Borginia.
</line><line>Klavier:
And they'll likely broadcast our dealings in court today. ...Including the part about the <textEffects>Borginian Cocoon</textEffects>.
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah but... but... But...!
</line><line>Apollo:
But, if Machi doesn't admit to smuggling now... ...he'll eventually be picked up by the Borginian police. And it's not like he's in any danger in our court. We're not going to find him guilty of murder here, not now!
</line><line>Daryan:
Yeah, but... you can't do this! You can't... You can't accuse me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Maybe the "law" doesn't allow it... But who's going to think you're really innocent after hearing this trial? ...The same goes for Machi Tobaye.
</line><line>Daryan:
...Urk...!
</line><line>Apollo:
The cocoon smuggling, your entire plan... ...Machi Tobaye knows everything. There's only one way out of it for him. And that's to acknowledge his own crime! The crime of <textEffects>cocoon smuggling</textEffects>!
</line><line>Daryan:
...... ...... Heh. D-Don't worry, there. I'll get... I'll get you out of the country. I'll set you up someplace. A hidden mansion? Real nice. You want a house made out of cookies? Or no, a house made out of pianos? C'mon... ...Please! Don't taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalk!
</line><line>Klavier:
...Daryan. I consider that my last session with you. ...We rocked.
</line><line>Apollo:
...I'm guessing we can treat that outburst as a confession?
</line><line>Daryan:
...Heh...heh heh heh...
</line><line>Trucy:
Uh oh, he's laughing again.
</line><line>Apollo:
There's a kind of sick desperation in it now, though.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well... have you been listening to today's trial?
</line><line>Machi:
...Yes.
</line><line>Judge:
And you'll talk? You <i>[sic]</i> tell this court everything?
</line><line>Machi:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
I didn't want it to turn out this way. But... I'm not the kind of lawyer that can overlook a crime.
</line><line>Klavier:
Today's trial... was all for your benefit, you know? I see no reason why you should hesitate now.
</line><line>Machi:
...I knew. From beginning, I knew.
</line><line>Apollo:
Machi...
</line><line>Machi:
Situation... I cannot explain. But money. I needed. Very much money.
</line><line>Judge:
Today's trial... ...raises a delicate issue with our legal system. "The only thing definite in a court of law... ...is evidence." This is the golden rule. However...
</line><line>Klavier:
...It has become apparent that not all things can be tried by this standard.
</line><line>Judge:
Should another case of this sort surface... ...we may have to consider an alternate system by which to administer justice. ...Anyway, Mr. Machi Tobaye?
</line><line>Machi:
...Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
I promise you will receive a fair trial by the laws of our country. And, with regards to the current charges for the murder of Mr. LeTouse... ...this court is prepared to announce a verdict.
</line><line>Machi:
...I thank you. I... only lie. But you see truth! You find... truth.
</line><line>Judge:
...That's our job. Very well...! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...

Trucy:
I wonder what'll happen to Machi...
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, he did smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia. I guess there'll be another trial here...
</line><line>???:
All's well that ends well.
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy...!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I owe you both my thanks.
</line><line>Apollo:
Lamiroir...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
My, is something wrong?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm sorry...! I... Machi was your partner on stage! Your friend...!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...... Yes. I thought of him as my own son. Even now, I do. Yet... Something got ahold of him, something evil. I see that. And he must pay for what he has done. Is that not how it should be?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm still sorry...
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Do not be sorry. You have given me courage.
</line><line>Trucy:
Courage...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I am considering an eye operation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was my suggestion, actually.
</line><line>Trucy:
You mean, you'll be able to see again?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
It's funny. I have always been afraid of the "light". Light seems so harsh, so unforgiving...
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the doctor... ...Lamiroir lost her sight due to some kind of "accident".
</line><line>Apollo:
An accident...?
</line><line>Lamiroir:
As you know, I suffer from amnesia. I feared that, if I could see... ...perhaps it would open my eyes to the truth I have been running from. ...I was scared.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know what changed her mind? Hearing your defense in there today. She could feel your gaze, unwavering, always looking straight at the truth.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
...If the light returns to my eyes... ...I think I will take up painting.
</line><line>Apollo:
Painting...?
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right! She's the "<textEffects>landscape painter in sound</textEffects>", after all!
</line><line>Lamiroir:
I will paint the two of you. I promise.
</line><line>Trucy:
Woo hoo! I can't wait, Lamiroir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I owe you my thanks, too, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, thanks, Mr. Wright, but for what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You reminded me I need to hurry things along. ...On my <textEffects>secret mission</textEffects>, that is.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. Your secret mission.
</line><line>Lamiroir:
Apollo, Trucy... I hope that we will meet again someday soon.
</line><line>Trucy:
You bet! Me, too!

<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(And so, like a ballad, the trial flowed on and on... until it came to the end. Thanks to the trial... ..."<span style="color:#E16935">The Guitar's Serenade</textEffects>" was a huge hit. Prosecutor Gavin's even more dazzling to look at now.
