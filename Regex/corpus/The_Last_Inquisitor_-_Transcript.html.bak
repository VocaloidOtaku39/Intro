The Last Inquisitor</div>
<line>
<i>Special Court</i>
</line><line>Judge:
Court is now once again in session. However... I must say, I am quite surprised at this recent turn of events... To see Miss Kira at the witness stand once again... Frankly, I cannot believe my eyes! You...were most certainly sent to the flames as a witch!
</line>
<center>Th-that's right! I was there! I saw it! She most certainly was...Th-then how... How is she still alive?!Is it...because she's a witch? Can witches not die?!No! She...she must have used "Dimere" and vanished just in time!I-I say send her straight to the fire! We'll do it ourselves if we have to!</center>
<line>
Darklaw:
...Enough. A witch must be in possession of a Talea Magica in order to use magic. I hate to disappoint you all, but do you see such a thing on her person? ...I think not!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but... She must have... That girl must have used Dimere. Surely you can see that, High Inquisitor.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Dimere is a spell able to make someone disappear from sight. It cannot make one vanish entirely. And besides... an investigation conducted by the Knights of the Inquisition has concluded that this girl is not capable of using magic.
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Listen well, Miss Kira. Your existence alone jeopardizes the very peace of Labyrinthia. Yet, given the current situation... it is now imperative that you testify to this court regarding what you saw. Immediately!
</line><line>Darklaw:

</line><line>Darklaw:
...That will not be necessary.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what...?
</line><line>Darklaw:
This girl has already been convicted and tried as a witch in a previous trial. What good could come of her testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
But... She was found hiding at the crime scene! I'd say that makes her a very important witness! A witness whose testimony we cannot choose to ignore!
</line><line>Judge:
High Inquisitor Darklaw... I'm afraid your objection is overruled.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ You wish to proceed then? Very well. ...Let us see just how much of her "story" this girl is willing to tell the court, shall we?
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's no doubt about it. Ms Kira must have <span style="color:#E16935">escaped</textEffects> through the passage leading under the Chamber of Fire. Although... from the looks of it, the judge doesn't have a clue that escape route even exists.)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
I wish he'd hurry up and get the hint! I'm dying to take this helmet off already. The top of my head REALLY itches...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, Maya. Take that thing off now, and we're as good as done. Just hang in there a little while longer.
</line><line>Maya:
Aaawww...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Witness... You may begin your testimony. Explain to the court how you are standing here in court today... And why you were hiding at the crime scene!

<line>Kira:
I am not familiar with this "Kira" you keep talking about... I came from the Eldwitch Woods...
I came to this town...to summon forth the fire dragon and kill the Storyteller.
As it rained...I waited near the bell tower, next to the Vigilantes, for my chance.
I...was only there to carry out my orders. I don't know anything else...outside of that.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Y-you came here to...KILL the Storyteller?!
</line><line>Kira:
...Yes. That was my task.
</line><line>Darklaw:

</line><line>Darklaw:
Keep in mind, this girl was not the one who summoned the fire dragon in the end... That was the accused! As I warned you earlier, there is nothing to be gained from this witch's testimony!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Now hold on. She was still <textEffects>present</textEffects> at the scene of the crime with the intent to murder the Storyteller! The defence insists we be permitted to continue with our cross-examination on those grounds! <textEffects>(Darklaw is really trying to weasel her way out of this cross-examination... That means...there HAS to be something there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ ...Hmph...
</line><line>Judge:
I must admit, I too am extremely interested in hearing what this witness has to say. ...Defender! You may begin your interrogation!

<textEffects>I...was only there to carry out my orders. I don't know anything else...outside of that.</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm...doesn't look like there's much to work with...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... Even though she just finished explaining everything, I still don't fully understand. Oh man, Nick... You don't think this Kira is actually some sort of crazy magical zombie, do you?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Maya. You went through the same thing as Kira. Did you become a "magical zombie"?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh yeah... I guess not, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Luke and I couldn't believe it was Kira when we ran into her in the marketplace... I mean, we thought for sure she was a goner back at the trial.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
I don't think I'm far off, though. This Kira is way different than the old Kira. It looks like she doesn't remember a thing. She's almost like another person entirely.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... What if that's just it, Maya? What if the Kira right here, right now, is the <textEffects>real</textEffects> Kira and the "old" Kira wasn't?
</line><line>Maya:
The real Kira, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, and that's why... I think I'm bound to find <span style="color:#E16935">something useful</textEffects> in her testimony!)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
We can do this, Nick! I hope you're ready to slam on some desks, because we're gonna do some serious pressing here!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
There was, in fact, a robe dropped and left at the crime scene tonight.
</line><line>Judge:
A <textEffects>robe</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira... That <textEffects>robe of invisibility</textEffects> that you mentioned earlier wouldn't happen to be... this one right here, would it?
</line><line>Darklaw:

</line><line>Darklaw:
How ludicrous! You are trying to tell the court THAT is the robe of invisibility? If it's really a robe of invisibility, then...how is it we can <textEffects>see</textEffects> it right now, dirty white spots and all?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaarrrgh! <textEffects>(Well...she's kinda got a point there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, hey! What if the robe...actually disappears when <textEffects>you wear it</textEffects>?! Give it here, Nick! Watch in wonder as Maya the Magnificent disappears before your very eyes!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
...So? Are you amazed yet?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ ...Yeah, I'm amazed. At how totally <textEffects>ridiculous</textEffects> you look in that.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! What gives?! This thing must be busted or something! ...I didn't disappear at all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm...well, that's not it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>...No...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
Tonight...at the bell tower...I was wearing that robe.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh... What did you saaaaaaaay?! ...Order! I said order! B-but how is that possible? The robe did not disappear at all just now...
</line><line>Kira:
............ That's because of the white powder on it... It's usually not that dirty...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... Y-you mean...these spots here? <textEffects>(Please, don't tell me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Oh yeah! Patty totally unloaded an entire <textEffects>bag of flour</textEffects> on to those knights, remember?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not to mention it was still raining when we were up there. The flour must have gotten nice and wet, so it's stained the robe. Say, what if... we try washing the flour off...?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah! There is a small water fountain at the edge of the square. Head there right now and wash the robe so that we can get to the bottom of this. Quickly now!
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>Town Square Outskirts</i>
</line><line>Maya:
All right, this shouldn't be too hard. Take notes, Nick. THIS is how you do the laundry! See, all you have to do is throw the robe into the water, like so...
</line>
<center>.....................</center>
<line>
Maya:
...Wait, what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
So? Do you see anything, Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Th-that's just it... I don't see a thing... It's disappeared...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?!
</line>
<hr />
<center>I frantically took a close look at the water in the fountain. But... the robe had actually <textEffects>vanished</textEffects> without a trace, right there inside the fountain!</center>
<hr />
<line><i>Special Court</i>
</line><line>Judge:
...Defender. What is the meaning of this?! How could you have lost such a vital piece of evidence?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Your Honour, it wasn't on purpose! Trust me, I wish I knew how it happened... <textEffects>(I can't believe it... The robe actually disappeared from sight...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>...Umm...</center>
<line>
Kira:
I don't quite know what you're talking about. I can...still see the robe just fine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Kira:
...Look. It's right here, see?
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no Ms Kira... I really DON'T see... <textEffects>(...Because there's nothing TO see!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
...So, is that how it works? Putting the robe on makes you disappear completely from sight... But from the looks of it, only Kira is able to actually see the robe itself...
</line><line>Kira:
...It is not just me. It's all inhabitants of the Eldwitch Woods. All of us can see the robe.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Eldwitch Woods...
</line><line>Kira:
Our village lies deep within the recesses of the forest...in a world much different from this one. That's where I live. As long as we obey the "law" of the land, we are allowed to live there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I knew it. There's definitely something different about Kira compared to the rest of the townspeople here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
For the time being... seeing as only the witness can see the robe, we will cover it in flour again for the sake of visibility.
</line><line>Invisible Robe updated in the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... There's still one tiny <textEffects>thing</textEffects> bothering me. Ms Kira, your robe was found on the middle floor of the bell tower, the same floor where we found my client. However...you were hiding on the <textEffects>uppermost level</textEffects> of the bell tower.
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
You testified a little while ago that you dropped your robe, but... I have to wonder... What exactly were you doing there on that top floor?!
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Judge:
...Hmm. It would seem...there is still much we must ask this witness. What say you, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ 'Tis the inquisition's duty to follow Milord's decision on such matters. ...I have no objections.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. Witness, you are hereby ordered to continue with your testimony. Tell us what happened between your sneaking up to the top floor of the bell tower and tonight's most terrible crime!
</line><line>Kira:
...Yes, okay.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>- What Happened on the Top Floor -</textEffects></center>
<line>Kira:
I was waiting on the middle floor of the tower. I started to turn around, but I was too late...
They attacked me from behind. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...
As I struggled to get away...I think I managed to pull something off of my attacker...
That's when I lost consciousness... I woke up to find myself next to the bell on the top floor of the tower.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
W-witness, are you saying... someone <textEffects>attacked</textEffects> you while you were in the bell tower?!
</line><line>Kira:
Yes... That is correct.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But...who?!
</line><line>Kira:
I...don't know. Th-they attacked me from behind, so I couldn't see who it was...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So you were unconscious the entire time after that?
</line><line>Kira:
That's why...I was unable to complete my mission... But even if I hadn't been unconscious, I couldn't have done anything trapped high up in the belfry like that...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... I wonder if that weird contraption we found there was used to move Kira up to the belfry... At least, I can't see any other way she could have got up there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Darklaw:
You heard the witness. She was locked up in the belfry of the tower. ...In other words, she couldn't have had anything to do with tonight's events. Therefore, there is no need for this utterly useless interrogation!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Not so fast! The witness also testified that someone <textEffects>attacked</textEffects> her tonight.
</line><line>Judge:
Defender, are you implying...that this attacker could have been Bezella?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I cannot say for certain, Your Honour. Regardless, the defence requests we be allowed to cross-examine this witness!
</line><line>Judge:
Request granted. Now then, defender, you may begin your interrogation!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And here's where the "fun" begins... Let's see if we can coax this "mysterious" <span style="color:#E16935">second witch</textEffects> out of hiding!)</span>

<line>Kira:
<textEffects>I was waiting on the middle floor of the tower. I started to turn around, but I was too late...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kira:
<textEffects>I heard the incantation for Fainfol and before I could even turn around...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Kira:
<textEffects>They attacked me from behind. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...</textEffects>

<line>Kira:
<textEffects>I was suddenly attacked. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...</textEffects>

<line>Kira:
<textEffects>As I struggled to get away...I think I managed to pull something off of my attacker...</textEffects>

<line>Kira:
<textEffects>That's when I lost consciousness... I woke up to find myself next to the bell on the top floor of the tower.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wonder...could Kira's attacker have actually been a <span style="color:#E16935">witch</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... It really doesn't look like magic was used to knock her out, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anyway... It looks like Kira is telling the truth. Still... <textEffects>(She's definitely avoiding eye contact... Not to mention, she seems extremely hesitant. There's no doubt about it. She's trying to <span style="color:#E16935">keep something big</textEffects> from getting out!)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
In that case, Nick... Let's give it all we've got and get to the bottom of this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... It really feels like there's a lot riding on this one, Maya.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
...Ms Kira. I have watched you at that witness stand this entire trial... desperately trying to keep something hidden from the rest of the court.
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wonder if you're familiar with the saying: "A <textEffects>lie</textEffects> begets more lies"... It means...multiple lies are bound to unravel and leave your story with more <textEffects>holes</textEffects> than Swiss cheese.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Get...to...the point, defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the Grand Grimoire, Fainfol causes a person to lose all consciousness. It's written here in black and white: "Its effect takes hold <textEffects>the second</textEffects> the incantation is heard."
</line><line>Kira:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira... You testified as follows... You heard the incantation for Fainfol and immediately became aware of the presence of your attacker. You then put up a fight... But! If you really did hear that incantation... there's no way you would've been able to yank that pendant from your assailant!
</line><line>Kira:
Uh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Orderrr! What...is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The meaning is that Ms Kira didn't actually hear the incantation like she claims she did!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but then, why... Why on earth was this girl unconscious?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Kira was definitely knocked out by whoever attacked her... and when she woke up, she found herself up on the top floor of the bell tower.)</textEffects> It's possible Ms Kira was rendered unconscious by...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The answer here is obvious. Something other than magic must have knocked her out.
</line><line>Darklaw:

</line><line>Darklaw:
...And what, may I ask, makes you so certain of that?! Is it not possible that another spell could have been used?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's just not possible... You, of all people, should know that.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Wh-what?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira's claim that she heard someone say the incantation is completely false. Even so... that wouldn't be too much of a problem if she actually had heard an incantation.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-that... That's right...
</line><line>Phoenix:
However... Going by her testimony, that can't have been the case. The only spell capable of making someone lose consciousness is Fainfol. Isn't that right, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
D-defender! Are you claiming there is another way, beside magic, that could have been used to render Miss Kira unconscious?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's only one other thing that crossed my mind... I'm speaking, of course, about <textEffects>sleeping medicine</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Sleeping medicine?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you remember, Ms Kira stated that the attacker <textEffects>covered her mouth</textEffects> before she could scream. In doing that...the attacker was able to administer a potent <textEffects>sleep medicine</textEffects>, thus putting Ms Kira out like a light.
</line><line>Judge:
H-hmm... Indeed. That does make sense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, Your Honour! The attacker did not necessarily have to be Bezella. ...I mean, why would an all-powerful being, capable of commanding any and all magic, need to resort to drugging someone?
</line><line>Darklaw:

</line><line>Darklaw:
Hold it right there, defender! They managed to sneak past the guards and make their way up into the bell tower! Clearly they must have used magic to appear invisible!

</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't need magic to make yourself disappear, High Inquisitor. ...Throw this on, and getting past those guards at the tower is a piece of cake.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-the robe of invisibility...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But, despite all that...there's still one glaring problem. ...Ms Kira.
</line><line>Kira:
Y-yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You admitted to the court earlier that you were attacked from the front, correct? If that's the case...then there's only one possible conclusion we can draw. You, Ms Kira...were entirely capable of <textEffects>seeing your attacker's face</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kira:
Wh-wh-why is that?! I didn't...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It's simple. You even said it yourself. Only residents of the Eldwitch Woods are able to <textEffects>see this robe</textEffects>. That means, Ms Kira...there is a piece of this puzzle only you could possibly <textEffects>know</textEffects>! Only you can tell us the <textEffects>identity</textEffects> of the person who entered the bell tower and attacked you tonight!
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Judge:
............
</line><line>Maya:
............
</line><line>Kira:
............ ...I can't tell you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
...No matter what happens... ...I just can't tell you, no matter what...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You see, everyone... This witness has been covering up for someone from the very start of this trial.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But luckily for us...we won't be needing any more of Ms Kira's testimony. Because the <textEffects>answer</textEffects> is staring us right in the face. I'm speaking, of course, about the true identity of Ms Kira's <textEffects>attacker</textEffects>... All the clues so far point to this <textEffects>one person</textEffects>!
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Defender. I take it you are prepared to prove such a serious accusation?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I am. <textEffects>(All right...it looks like it all comes down to this. Now we'll finally see who's been <span style="color:#E16935">pulling the strings</textEffects> this whole time...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Defender, tell the court... Who was the one responsible for attacking the witness and locking her up on the top floor of the bell tower?!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The answer is obvious, Your Honour. It was you! ...High inquisitor Darklaw!
</line><line>Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! Order in the court! I-inconceivable... There's no way...
</line><line>Darklaw:
I must say, defender... Your courage is impressive, however reckless you may be. Accusing a High Inquisitor is no small feat, I assure you... However... With serious accusations come serious consequences. One small misstep... and I will personally see that you never set foot in this courtroom ever again. ...Mark my words, defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ I understand.
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Hmph. My, how confident. Let us see if that confidence of yours... is well justified!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira's attacker drugged her with <textEffects>sleep medicine</textEffects>. It likely took no more than a few seconds for her to lose consciousness. The medicine must've been very potent...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...true. After all, its effects appear somewhat similar to magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's only...one person I can think of in all of Labyrinthia who could supply you with that kind of medicine. ...Sir Newton Belduke.
</line><line>Darklaw:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Darklaw:
Defender, you are aware...that Sir Belduke has been deceased for over three months now, are you not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's a fact I'm well aware of, believe me. While he was still alive, Sir Belduke provided the citizens of this town with a variety of medicines for whatever ailed them... But it wasn't all just medicine. He also created some very <textEffects>dangerous</textEffects> concoctions. That's why, after he passed away...all of his medicines and creations were confiscated.
</line><line>Judge:
C-confiscated?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham said as much in the last witch trial.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Barnham:
The victim was an alchemist, after all. We were hoping the items confiscated from his study could provide some clues. Besides, such things must not fall into the wrong hands. It may not be standard practice, but it was deemed necessary. The confiscated goods are stored in our secret vault. The only person with access to them is the High Inquisitor, Lady Darklaw.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Ah...
</line><line>Darklaw:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Darklaw:
So, because I have access to the medicine, I must be the one that used it... Is that what you are getting at, defender?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right...
</line><line>Darklaw:
Unfortunately for you...I would hardly call that "proof". You said it yourself... Sir Belduke concocted a plethora of dangerous medicines in his efforts to assist the people of the town... He was <textEffects>well known</textEffects> for this fact... A fact that he no doubt was none too pleased with. As such, it is highly likely that those same dangerous substances are still scattered throughout the town!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
And therefore, defender...it is entirely possible that the culprit was able to get their hands on such dangerous medicine.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. Long has Sir Belduke's medicine played an active part in maintaining the health of this town's citizens... There is plenty of reason to believe some of his more dangerous medicines still remain within Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Hmph... A piece of advice, defender: the next time you speak in court... I recommend you try procuring some real evidence before spouting such idiotic accusations. If you fail to do so...your next words will be uttered to the flames.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Figures... I knew she wouldn't take that argument sitting down.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Both High Inquisitor Darklaw and Inquisitor Barnham are the very harbingers of justice within Labyrinthia. Raising such an accusation against either one of them without valid reason will result in the most severe of <textEffects>punishments</textEffects>.
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-what does he mean by the "most severe of punishments"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think the judge is saying that if I don't start making a case...we're gonna be paying Sir Belduke a visit real soon. <textEffects>(I need to present some <span style="color:#E16935">decisive evidence</textEffects> and fast... I'm pretty sure I should be able to do that much... High Inquisitor Darklaw is the attacker, and the one thing that <textEffects>proves</textEffects> it is...)</span>

<line>Darklaw:
O-on...me?
</line><line>Judge:
I must admit I do not know where you are going with this defender, but...please point out this clue to the court. Show us this <textEffects>clue</textEffects>, supposedly still on the High Inquisitor's person!
</line>


<line>Judge:
Th-the... The High Inquisitor's...<textEffects>neck</textEffects>? You don't mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ms Kira yanked this pendant off of her attacker's neck. Take a look at the necklace...it still has a bit of <textEffects>blood</textEffects> left on it.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to her earlier testimony, when Ms Kira pulled at the necklace... she supposedly felt herself <textEffects>scratch</textEffects> the attacker's neck. Is that correct, Ms Kira?
</line><line>Kira:
...Y-yes...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore! The attacker should still have a <textEffects>mark</textEffects> on their neck from having been scratched.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Would you mind letting the court take a look at your neck, High Inquisitor Darklaw? I'm pretty sure that underneath that high collar, we'll find exactly the <textEffects>mark</textEffects> we're looking for! ...Unless, of course, you were able to get rid of it with magic!
</line><line>Darklaw:
...... ......... ............ Hmph...most impressive.
</line><line>Judge:
...What?
</line><line>Darklaw:
I have to say, defender... You've managed to finally hone that dull blade of yours into something of use. You are correct. There is, in fact, a <textEffects>mark</textEffects> on my neck that I did receive tonight.
</line><line>Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line>
<center>...L-Lady Darklaw......Wh-what is the meaning of this?...Does that mean Lady Darklaw is......the Great Witch?............</center>

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Your Honour...I know you're shocked and everything, but c'mon...work with me here.)</textEffects> Your Honour, the defence... would like to call High Inquisitor Darklaw to the witness stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what did you just say?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's quite clear that the High Inquisitor has some connection to what transpired tonight! And what's more... There is a chance that she used her position of authority as High Inquisitor to frame my client as the Great Witch!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but, never in all my years as judge of this court has an inquisitor been asked to take the stand in the middle of a trial!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Well, we're going to have to make some history here if we're finally going to find the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>, Your Honour!
</line><line>Judge:
E-even so... This trial cannot continue any further without an inquisitor!
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! Um, in that case...how about you get Inquisitor Barn-
</line><line>Darklaw:
Inquisitor Barnham remains incarcerated in the underground dungeons, for the crime of treason against the Storyteller. ...I don't think he will be able to make it to this party.
</line><line>Maya:
N-no way!
</line><line>Darklaw:
Most regrettable, defender.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This whole thing is hopeless... Unless High Inquisitor Darklaw takes to the witness stand... Espella will be done for... and the truth along with her!

I believe I can fill that role.

Professor, wait...what are you saying?!

I can prove conclusively... that Espella Cantabella, is in fact the Great Witch Bezella! Now, Mr Wright. The time has come at last, to settle this once and for all!

</line><line>Layton:
...I'm afraid my only concern here is the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The truth...?
</line><line>Layton:
The truth behind the real identity of the Great Witch...Espella Cantabella. If seeking the truth requires us to stand on opposite sides of the courtroom... then so be it. I expect you to defend Miss Cantabella with everything you've got, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Court is now back in session. Are you prepared, High Inquisitor?
</line><line>Darklaw:
So long as I remain on the witness stand, I am no longer High Inquisitor. Simply "Darklaw", will suffice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw... I'd like to just confirm something. A moment ago, we established... that you were, in fact, present at the bell tower during the time of the incident. That makes a total of <textEffects>three</textEffects> people at the scene.
</line><line>Darklaw:
...It would appear that was the case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, you managed to stay hidden from ten different guards... with the help of this right here.
</line><line>Judge:
The <textEffects>robe of invisibility</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
In other words, there is every reason to be suspicious of your actions tonight.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Lady Darklaw... While I cannot believe you would deceive us in such a way... I ask that you tell the court what happened at the time of the incident.

<line>Darklaw:
The town square was to be the parade's final stop. I patrolled the perimeter to ensure nothing was amiss.
As I passed by the bell tower, a pair of small footprints leading inside caught my eye. I went inside to investigate.
I had my own reasons for not allowing any one of those Vigilantes to see me...
I climbed the stairs up the bell tower and saw an intruder inside with their back turned. I proceeded to apprehend them.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You <textEffects>apprehended</textEffects> the intruder...?
</line><line>Darklaw:
While I hold the position of High Inquisitor... there are often times when I must partake in various secret tasks, unbeknownst to the citizens of Labyrinthia. One of those tasks being...ensuring the <textEffects>security</textEffects> of the Storyteller.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Security?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...As such, there is nothing odd nor suspicious about my actions tonight.

But, there's absolutely no way you would have been able to disappear from sight! Not unless...you either used magic or were wearing this robe.
</line><line>Darklaw:
The night is still young, defender. You ought to save the theatrics for later.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?!
</line><line>Darklaw:
There was indeed a very <textEffects>simple</textEffects> way that I was able to sneak into the bell tower.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A...simple way? Like what?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Come now. Must I really spell it out for you? I used this.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-that's...
</line><line>Darklaw:
This is the <textEffects>whistle</textEffects> used by the guardsmen to warn of danger. The second any guard hears this whistle, they immediately head out to investigate the trouble...Vigilantes included. With a simple blow of this whistle... those guards took off from their post.
</line><line>Layton:
And then, the second they were distracted, you crept into the bell tower undetected.
</line><line>Darklaw:
All I needed was a small <textEffects>break</textEffects> in their perimeter to sneak in. It was so easy, even a person of your calibre could do it.

Y'know, if Darklaw was just going into the bell tower to arrest some intruder... then I wonder why she didn't just come out and say that to begin with?

Simple... That information was on a strictly <textEffects>need-to-know</textEffects> basis.
</line><line>Maya:
Need-to-know basis, huh...?

That sort of secrecy is pretty common, but usually they've got to have a <textEffects>reason</textEffects> for not disclosing the information to begin with. <textEffects>(Darklaw was hiding this information for a reason.

No! You're lying, Lady Darklaw! When I was waiting up there at the top of the bell tower, I was most certainly wearing that robe.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
Lady Darklaw...you... You were also wearing a similar robe, were you not? Don't you remember?!
</line><line>Darklaw:
Hmph... What nonsense. I haven't a clue what you're babbling about. I simply managed to sneak right by those makeshift guards... 'Twas not the most demanding of tasks for someone like me.

Ms Kira... You're saying that Ms Darklaw was <textEffects>not by herself</textEffects> at the time of the incident tonight?

Wh-what?!

A <textEffects>girl</textEffects>...? Could that be...

Miss Darklaw, you of all people should be aware... that this isn't a matter of believing or not believing. I'm afraid those are words that carry no meaning here.
</line><line>Darklaw:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
The only thing that carries any meaning here within the courtroom is evidence. Don't you agree, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes. Absolutely, Professor.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Well, now...things are beginning to heat up a little, are they not? Fine. Tell me, defender...have you the means to prove this assertion? Do you actually think you can prove that I, the High Inquisitor of Labyrinthia, carried the accused into the bell tower?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(From the looks of it, Ms Kira was supposed to keep quiet about Darklaw's little secret... But she couldn't deal with all of Darklaw's denials and finally found the guts to chime in. I can't let Kira's effort go to waste... I don't care what stands in my way... I'm going to find the truth!)</textEffects> ...Your Honour, the defence wishes to present evidence proving that Ms Darklaw did, in fact, carry my client up the tower!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, defender. You may present your evidence. Show us the evidence that proves Lady Darklaw carried the accused up the bell tower!

<line>Phoenix:
There was something in your testimony just now that I'm not buying... ...And that's the <textEffects>footprints</textEffects> that were left at the bell tower.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Did I not just finish admitting that those were my footprints?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw, you stated the following: "There was no heel on the footprints, so as I ascended the stairs, I was careful to match my footsteps to them <textEffects>as far as possible</textEffects>"... However, the reality is... the footprints pictured in the sketch actually do contain a <textEffects>heel</textEffects>. That means...something must have <textEffects>prevented</textEffects> you from being able to tiptoe along the footprints that were already there.
</line><line>Judge:
"Prevented"...? Ah! Y-you mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's right, Your Honour. Ms Darklaw, when you climbed up the bell tower tonight... you must have been carrying Ms Cantabella on your back. Is that correct?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you remember, it rained quite heavily tonight. That means the stairs must have been quite slippery. With your two hands occupied carrying my client, <textEffects>there would be no safe way</textEffects> for you to tiptoe up the stairs without falling... That right there is the truth behind the footprints on the staircase!
</line><line>Judge:
L-Lady Darklaw... Y-you...
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ ...Fine. I admit it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
It is as you say... I donned the robe and made my way up the tower. But I was not alone. I carried both Espella Cantabella and her little "friend" up the tower with me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>Little friend</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Darklaw:
That black-furred creature of hers. The thing is nary ever a second from her side.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh! She must mean Eve!
</line><line>Darklaw:
When I arrived at the top of the tower... I saw this girl already there and called out to her.
</line><line>Kira:
...I was very shocked to see the mistress show up in person like that.
</line><line>Darklaw:
The girl's presence was an inconvenience... So I immediately put her to sleep. Believe it or not, it's just like you said, defender. I used what remained of Belduke's medicine to put the girl out of the picture.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's when... Ms Kira put up a fight and pulled this pendant right off your neck, correct?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...That's right.
</line><line>Judge:
I cannot fathom it. That would mean... This pendant actually belongs to you, Lady Darklaw?!
</line><line>Pendant updated in the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ ...I just have one question, Ms Darklaw. Why? Why take Espella up the bell tower? Why render her unconscious? ...And why go through the trouble of sneaking past the guards? What exactly was your <textEffects>aim</textEffects> in all of this?!
</line><line>Darklaw:
...I am in no way obliged to answer that question, defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Wh-what makes you say that?!
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Simple. None of this has any relevance to the case at hand. That is why.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Layton:
Your Honour, if I may... The inquisition believes...the defence's question to be irrelevant to the current case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Professor... What are you saying?!
</line><line>Layton:
It would seem the defence has forgotten a very important point. Namely, the <textEffects>point</textEffects> of this, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Layton:
The aim of this trial is to find the identity of the Great Witch Bezella. Whether or not Miss Darklaw locked the witness at the top of the bell tower... is hardly relevant to the purpose of this trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but...
</line><line>Layton:
...There is one thing that is very clear. Neither Miss Darklaw nor this witness could possibly be Bezella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What...?
</line><line>Layton:
If either one of the two were Bezella, then there would be no need for them to have used this robe of invisibility. They cannot use any magic... Therefore, it is inconceivable that either of them could be the Great Witch.
</line><line>Judge:
...A rather straightforward argument if there ever was one.
</line><line>Layton:
At the time of the incident, there were three people present. Of those three, two used the robe of invisibility to vanish from sight. Leaving only one person. Indeed... Miss Cantabella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urgh!
</line><line>Layton:
...With this in mind, the larger question is: who is Bezella?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Is that not obvious? The accused, Espella Cantabella, is the only possible answer. Besides, the accused's voice was heard by all the townspeople, chanting the spell <textEffects>Granwyrm</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
N-not so fast! I happen to think these witnesses are extremely relevant to this trial! Did you forget about Ms Kira? She supposedly took a one-way trip into that pit of fire over there. And yet here she is, in one piece, testifying that she returned in order to KILL the ruler of Labyrinthia, the Storyteller. ...Then there's Ms Darklaw, who rendered the defendant unconscious and proceeded to transport her up the bell tower. ...I'd say there's MORE than enough reason to investigate <textEffects>who these two really are</textEffects>!
</line><line>Layton:
Only to discover that they are not, in fact, the Great Witch Bezella...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I'm saying there's a possibility that these two are somehow related to Bezella!
</line><line>Judge:
...The court will now announce its thoughts on the matter. I must say, what Inquisitor Layton has stated certainly does ring true. However, Lady Darklaw... I have one question I must ask you. What exactly were you hoping to <textEffects>accomplish</textEffects> here tonight?
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ I assure you...'twas not my intent to deceive the good citizens of Labyrinthia. However... I must now reveal the truth to you all...
</line>
<center>...Wh-what did she say?...You don't think Lady Darklaw is in league with the witches, do you...?...She can't be! She was the one that saw to that other witch's demise...</center>
<line>
Judge:
Lady Darklaw... Are you saying that you're...
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Hmph... That's right, Milord. I am a Shade.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A Shade...
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Judge:
...Lady Darklaw. Will you please tell the court exactly what you mean when you say "<textEffects>Shade</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Darklaw:
Yes...of course. I grow weary of standing behind this bench. I will tell you all I can.

<textEffects>(What the heck is she trying to pull...? Why testify about something that could potentially undermine your credibility?)</textEffects>

Layton:
...I do hope you have not forgotten what we established only moments ago. It is not possible for Miss Darklaw to be Bezella.
</line><line>Judge:
B-but, Inquisitor Layton! Surely the testimony just now proves it...
</line><line>Layton:
I am afraid that in the heat of such "revelations", you have all misheard the information.
</line><line>Darklaw:
...'Tis pointless. This is the extent of what the people of this town will believe.

</line><line>Maya:
Whatcha thinking, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm thinking there's something really weird going on with Darklaw.
</line><line>Maya:
Really? Do tell!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I mean, just listen to her testimony. She's more than willing to elaborate on some potentially incriminating information.
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm...I see your point.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The one REALLY trying to put an end to the Story... could be Darklaw herself.
</line><line>Maya:
I guess... But still...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh?
</line><line>Maya:
Remember, Nick, we're here to save Espella. So let's squeeze every last bit of information we can out of Darklaw and clear Espella's name!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Y'know, you could be on to something. <textEffects>(I'd better gather as much information as possible, for the time being.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Something that doesn't exist</textEffects> ...? I have a feeling no one is going to like the <textEffects>answer</textEffects> I'm about to give, and it'll probably end up shaking this town to its core... But...I've got to tell them. The truth has to come out!)</span> ...Since I arrived here in Labyrinthia, there's been no shortage of really strange events. Ignaize, Dimere, Godoor, Goldor... and now Granwyrm.
</line><line>Layton:
The mere command of magic is in itself a crime, is it not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In this town, witches are arrested and made to participate in witch trials. They are then sentenced to death by fire. ...But none of those witches actually died! That supposed "death by fire" wasn't real! And... neither is magic. ...It doesn't really <textEffects>exist</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what are you saying, defender?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Eldwitch Woods apparently contain some rather large <textEffects>machines</textEffects> unlike anything that exists within Labyrinthia. Machines that emit fire and produce large plumes of smoke. To top it all off, the citizens of Labyrinthia are <textEffects>not able to see</textEffects> said machines...
</line><line>Judge:
It sounds like nothing more than magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... That's exactly it, Your Honour. Ms Darklaw.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Magic</textEffects> doesn't really <textEffects>exist</textEffects> in this town. That's the answer, isn't it?
</line><line>Judge:
M-magic does not... What utter nonsense!
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ It seems we have finally arrived at the stunning conclusion... ...The <textEffects>secret</textEffects> behind Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Judge:
Wha............ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! ORDER, I say! Wh...wh-what is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means...that all of the magic you've seen in this town... was nothing more than an <textEffects>illusion</textEffects> created and put into motion by the Shades!
</line><line>Judge:
But, defender! The witches...we have clearly seen them use magic!
</line><line>Layton:
............ Hmm... Let us take a moment to think carefully about the <textEffects>systems</textEffects> employed by the Shades.
</line><line>Judge:
S-<textEffects>systems</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Layton:
What is <textEffects>essential</textEffects> in order for a witch to use magic?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witch must possess a <textEffects>Talea Magica</textEffects> and must say an <textEffects>incantation</textEffects> in order to cast a spell.
</line><line>Layton:
...And the spells able to be cast are determined by the sceptre's <textEffects>magic gems</textEffects>. Now, what do you think is the purpose of placing such requirements on the use of magic?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what do you mean..."purpose"?
</line><line>Layton:
These requirements are not there to allow the user to <textEffects>cast</textEffects> magic. Rather, the reality is they are there to inform the Shades of <textEffects>who should be using</textEffects> magic.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Layton:
It is possible...that witches were always being closely observed by Shades. That's why they donned these robes... To appear hidden until they were needed to <textEffects>create</textEffects> magic.
</line><line>Judge:
"<textEffects>Create</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Layton:
...Indeed. There are all kinds of spells within this tome. It would be quite troublesome if they were simply allowed to use any spell at will.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah...it would make the Shades' job that much more difficult, for sure.
</line><line>Layton:
Precisely so. That is why it was imperative that a certain <textEffects>restriction</textEffects> be placed on the use of magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah... You're referring to the <textEffects>Talea Magica</textEffects>, right, Professor?
</line><line>Judge:
Of course... No wonder the sceptre could contain only <textEffects>two magic gems</textEffects>!
</line><line>Layton:
Then there's the incantation... What would happen if a witch could simply whisper the incantation quietly to herself, or not even say it at all?
</line><line>Maya:
Boy, that'd be so cool... I'd be casting spells all day long, and no one would ever <textEffects>see it coming</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya, we spent an entire trial proving that you WEREN'T a witch, remember? If the witches didn't give some sort of <textEffects>signal</textEffects>... then there would be no way for the Shades to know <textEffects>when</textEffects> to "cast" the spell!
</line><line>Layton:
Right you are, Mr Wright. The incantations were a way of telling the Shades when the witch was <textEffects>ready to use magic</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what on earth...? Never did I think these requirements could have such a purpose!
</line><line>Layton:
...Now, let's think back to the previous events, leading up to today, that have involved magic. Our first encounter with "magic" was the use of the spell <textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects> a few nights ago. A "spell" like this... was nothing more than a flame spewed from a <textEffects>machine</textEffects> being used by the Shades.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-then that means...<textEffects>Dimere</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
A spell that makes the caster <textEffects>disappear</textEffects>? No doubt about it... It must have been this robe.
</line><line>Layton:
Next is the incident with <textEffects>Goldor</textEffects>, the spell that "transmuted" me into a gold statue. While I understand this may sound a bit absurd, I can only surmise... that the Shades created a gold statue in my image, took me and left it in my place the instant the incantation was uttered.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Professor...it's no more absurd than anything else that's happened so far...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
...We can therefore conclude that all of the "magic" in Labyrinthia was created in a similar vein. What do you say to that, Miss Darklaw?
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ ...I'd expect nothing less from you, Inquisitor Layton.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
At any given time, there were between five and ten witches in town. All of the witches were accompanied by Shades at all times. It was easier than you would think. You see, the Shades living in the Eldwitch Woods total in the hundreds. It was simply a matter of having each of the Shades operate in shifts, in order to watch over each of the witches within the town.
</line><line>Judge:
I must say, Lady Darklaw... That is quite a number of Shades...
</line><line>Darklaw:
'Twas not only those who fell victim to the flames that were turned into Shades, but their <textEffects>victims</textEffects> too were made permanent residents of the Eldwitch Woods.
</line><line>Maya:
...! Th-then... those two shady thieves from before were... turned into Shades...?
</line><line>Darklaw:
Ah, yes. You mean Robbs and Muggs. Despite their dubious appearance, those two were a couple of my best Shades.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Shady thieves turned into Shades. This stuff writes itself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...I cannot believe what I have heard...
</line>
<center>............</center>
<line>
Layton:
...However, there is still one thing I do not understand just yet.
</line><line>Darklaw:
...And what would that be?
</line><line>Layton:
As has just been explained...we have established that there is no <textEffects>possibility</textEffects> of magic being real. But...<textEffects>replacing me with a gold statue</textEffects> to give the illusion of transmutation, for example... While it sounds simple enough... I myself, and presumably also Miss Fey, have no recollection of this <textEffects>replacement</textEffects> actually taking place.
</line><line>Maya:
H-hey, that's right! The professor got all bling-blingy before I could even bat an eye!
</line><line>Layton:
It begs the question: how and when was that statue created, let alone used to replace me...?
</line><line>Judge:
Th-that is true...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The same goes for <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>. It's supposed to create a portal between two green-coloured walls.
</line><line>Layton:
Perhaps...that is exactly why the spell can only <textEffects>work</textEffects> on green walls, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Still...it'd be impossible for the Shades to get those "portals" ready so quickly.
</line><line>Layton:
I agree. If we take a moment to think... we can see that all of these spells have one strange thing in <textEffects>common</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A thing in common?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, indeed. Almost as if some time between the start and end of the incident was <textEffects>unaccounted for</textEffects>... Furthermore, any <textEffects>memory</textEffects> I might have had regarding the incident seems to have simply <textEffects>disappeared</textEffects> in the process.
</line><line>Maya:
I-I've got it! Nick... it's just like what happened to Kira. She's got absolutely NO memory of her life in Labyrinthia before the trial, right?
</line><line>Kira:
...Y-yes. I do not remember this "Kira" you speak of...
</line><line>Maya:
And... Oh yeah! When you really think about it... doesn't it seem super weird how the Shades are able to <textEffects>return</textEffects> to town if they complete their tasks?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're right, Maya. I mean...the townsfolk are bound to remember some things about them, right? ...Like how Ms Kira here threw a major hissy fit in court and was barbecued for being a witch...
</line><line>Layton:
Eloquently put, Mr Wright. Hence we cannot yet conclude that this entire illusion was primarily accomplished through the use of machinery. Simply put... there must have been some way of affecting the <textEffects>memories</textEffects> of all those within the confines of this town.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ Missing time and lost memories? Now that IS interesting, Inquisitor... You are correct. There is, in fact, a <textEffects>secret</textEffects> that lies within the depths of the Eldwitch Woods. Something that the people of this town cannot see... Something that can rob people of their time and memories... 'Tis the very thing that connects all of what you have heard tonight... 'Tis a secret of <textEffects>monumental</textEffects> proportions...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And... Let me guess... 'Tis a secret that cannot be revealed by the mistress of the Eldwitch Woods... Is that right?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Yes. An excellent deduction, defender.
</line><line>Judge:
"Witches' souls wander astray within the Eldwitch Woods"... Until tonight, I thought this nothing but a mere fairy tale told to children... But it has become clear that a seemingly large organisation lies within that forest!
</line><line>Darklaw:
The Witches' Court is the <textEffects>border</textEffects> between "this world" and the "other world".
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then...that means... In "<textEffects>this world</textEffects>", you're Labyrinthia's High Inquisitor...while also being mistress to the Shades in the "<textEffects>other world</textEffects>". <textEffects>(Otherwise known as the Great Witch...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
............ May I intervene for just a moment,  Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-sure!
</line><line>Layton:
In all honesty...there is still something that sticks out as a little odd. ...Particularly in Miss Darklaw's previous testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-did you say the...previous testimony? <textEffects>(Argh...I'd already pushed that out of my head...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
...There was one vital truth that we managed to take away from that testimony.
</line><line>Judge:
You mean that <textEffects>magic does not truly exist in Labyrinthia</textEffects>... Indeed, quite the vital, albeit shocking, truth.
</line><line>Layton:
However... There is one more <textEffects>truth</textEffects> hidden within that same testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(There's something else in that testimony? I must've checked the Court Record more times than I count, but...I didn't find a single other <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
Have you forgotten already, Mr Wright? Where there is no evidence left... we have but one more <textEffects>weapon</textEffects> at our disposal with which to uncover the truth.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh...hey! I've got it, Nick! Remember, in a witch trial you can cross-examine two witnesses at the same time...
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-hey, that's right! I completely forgot! Being able to have a look at two testimonies side-by-side is bound to turn up a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> somewhere!
</line><line>Layton:
And that <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>...should provide us with a much-needed clue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(I'm not entirely sure where the professor is going with this, but... I believe in his judgment. Besides, if we're going to blow this case wide open, it's got to be worth a shot!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. We will now take a closer look at Lady Darklaw's previous testimony.
</line><line>Layton:
This is it...Miss Darklaw's previous testimony. There is a glaring contradiction between this piece of testimony and the others... Ready yourself, Mr Wright!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Darklaw:
Shades live outside the realm of those who dwell within Labyrinthia. To them, I am known as "the Great Witch".
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honour, there's obviously a huge <textEffects>discrepancy</textEffects> between these two pieces of testimony. Ms Darklaw stated that she is known as the Great Witch... However, according to Ms Kira's testimony... Ms Darklaw WAS her "venerable mistress" - the Great Witch.
</line><line>Layton:
That is correct. She <textEffects>was</textEffects> the Great Witch... Note Miss Kira's use of the <textEffects>past tense</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
"Past tense"...? I am afraid my grammar is not quite what it used to be... May I ask what you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's simple. Ms Darklaw WAS mistress to the Shades...or as they also called her, "the Great Witch". Therefore... She...is <textEffects>no longer</textEffects> the Great Witch!
</line><line>Judge:
She is...NOT the Great Witch?! W-witness, is this true?!
</line><line>Kira:
Huh?! Uhh...I-I... ............
</line><line>Darklaw:
...It is as you have heard, Milord.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
I relinquished my position as Great Witch in order to fulfil the objective of this task.
</line><line>Judge:
What would that objective be again...?
</line><line>Layton:
That would be the <textEffects>assassination of the Storyteller</textEffects>, Your Honour.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Witness! At the beginning of this trial, you stated... that you came to town in order to complete your task, didn't you? What's more... You said that you were going to summon the fire dragon to do it. Now, this task...it wasn't Ms Darklaw here that gave it to you, was it?
</line><line>Kira:
...N-no, it wasn't...
</line><line>Layton:
So then...the most pressing question is: who was it that gave you that task? Who told you to come to Labyrinthia and assassinate the Storyteller?
</line><line>Kira:
............ I...I cannot tell you. ...No matter what...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(All right. So Darklaw isn't the "Great Witch" any more... Which must mean...the mastermind behind this entire thing is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Hm... It would seem the defence has worked it out as well. Mr Wright, you know <textEffects>who</textEffects> really gave Miss Kira her task tonight, do you not?
</line><line>Judge:
Defender, I ask that you enlighten the court. Show us who really gave this witness her task to assassinate the Storyteller!
</line>


<line>Judge:
The St-Storyteller...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We're talking about someone with the authority and power to replace the Great Witch. Someone who <textEffects>calls the shots</textEffects>. I can't think of anyone else that meets those criteria, except for the Storyteller himself.
</line><line>Judge:
P-preposterous! Then that would mean...
</line><line>Layton:
Exactly, Your Honour. It means that the Storyteller gave this final task to Kira himself. He was, in short, responsible for his own assassination.
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! Order in the court! ...But, for what purpose?! Why would he plan his own assassination?!
</line><line>Layton:
That I cannot say, Your Honour. However... The final chapter of the Story does tell of his inevitable <textEffects>death</textEffects>. While he assigned this task to Kira himself, it is perfectly natural that he would do so. However, what is not natural... is your behaviour tonight, Miss Darklaw.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what was <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects> about the High Inquisitor's behaviour?
</line><line>Layton:
You were once the head of all the Shades... and yet, tonight you tried to interfere with the Storyteller's plan. You rendered Miss Kira unconscious and locked her away in the belfry of the bell tower. That, to me, seems like the activity of someone aiming to <textEffects>put a stop</textEffects> to his plan altogether.
</line><line>Judge:
I-indeed... Lady Darklaw, what would be the reason for such behaviour?
</line><line>Darklaw:
............
</line><line>Layton:
I leave that to you, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Based on what we've seen in this trial, the defence believes Ms Darklaw's <textEffects>reason</textEffects> for covering up her actions tonight... can only be attributed to one thing. <textEffects>(This plan was handed down by the Storyteller himself... and Ms Darklaw was definitely aiming to put a wrench in it...but why?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Layton:
The Storyteller used the Great Witch Bezella to take his own life. Instructions to carry out the plan were given to Miss Kira. However... Miss Darklaw planned to intervene and change the scenario at the very last minute.
</line><line>Phoenix:
She planned to do so by changing the identity of the Great Witch from Ms Kira to Ms Cantabella.
</line><line>Layton:
Thus bringing us to our current situation: Miss Cantabella on trial for the murder of her father at the hands of Bezella. You, Miss Darklaw, seem to harbour a rather strong <textEffects>hatred</textEffects> for the Storyteller, if I am not mistaken.
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ ...Heh heh heh... A "hatred", you say? Yes...I suppose you could call it that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
That's right. Behold...my revenge.
</line><line>Judge:
D-did you say...revenge?
</line><line>Layton:
Miss Darklaw, will you please tell the court of your plan for revenge?
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ If you insist.
</line>
<hr />
<center>The High Inquisitor... And also, the Great Witch. Long have I donned those two masks. One, as Labyrinthia's protector... The other, its harbinger of destruction... In other words...I was merely meant to serve him. And yet... he sought to selfishly pen the ending of the Story under his own terms. He did not care enough about me...or any of the townspeople, to allow us the dignity of deciding our own fate!</center>
<line>
Darklaw:
Indeed. What we witnessed tonight... was the <textEffects>cowardly</textEffects> act of a man looking for an easy way to end that which he could not properly finish! He cared for no one but himself... Hence this sudden sham of an ending! And for that...I will never forgive him.
</line><line>Layton:
What do you mean by "sham of an ending"?
</line><line>Darklaw:
The Great Witch Bezella is to summon a dragon of fire and end the life of the Creator... She will then be put on trial and judged, thus heralding a period of peace and prosperity for all of Labyrinthia... Such is the <textEffects>ending</textEffects> written for this town and its people. 'Tis not an ending I oppose in principle. Who would not wish a happy ending for their own people? However, the problem lies...in Bezella's identity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Bezella's <textEffects>identity</textEffects>?
</line><line>Darklaw:
As you know, he... assigned the role of the Great Witch to this girl beside me.
</line><line>Layton:
But you're saying that was a <textEffects>falsehood</textEffects>... Is that correct?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...I knew Bezella's true identity. 'Tis not something I could ever forget. That is why...I went to the bell tower. And it is why I took the accused there. I did it...to ensure the <textEffects>true witch</textEffects>, foretold in the Story, was given the judgement she was due!
</line><line>Judge:
The true witch... Y-you don't mean...
</line><line>Darklaw:
...Yes! I speak of none other than Espella Cantabella!
</line><line>Espella:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw! There is a glaring contradiction in your statement.
</line><line>Darklaw:
And what would that be...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's supposedly common knowledge that Bezella is capable of using all magic. However! That is FAR from the truth! "Magic" does not actually exist in this town! It was all one giant <textEffects>illusion</textEffects> created by the Shades! Therefore... the Great Witch Bezella cannot exist either!
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Judge:
............
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line>
<center>............</center>
<line>
???:
</line>
<center>...Heh heh heh... ...You fool...</center>
<line>
Darklaw:
Defender... you really don't have a clue, do you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but, wait just a minute now! Is the defender not correct? If magic does not exist, then it goes without saying that witches do not exist either. And that would include the Great Witch, would it not?
</line>
<center>...Th-that's right!...They've been lying to us this whole time!...Dastards!...Bezella isn't real!</center>

</line><line>Layton:
...Mr Wright. There is...a fundamental <textEffects>mistake</textEffects> in your argument.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
</line><line>Layton:
I have but one simple question. What, exactly, is Bezella?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?! Well...err, she's...supposed to be the head of all witches...
</line><line>Layton:
...Allow me to reword the question. The Great Witch Bezella is the root of all <textEffects>disaster</textEffects> within Labyrinthia. Knowing that...what specific "disaster" might she have been the root of?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-that would be... Umm...
</line><line>Maya:
I just thought of something... We've been hearing Bezella's name left and right since we got here, but not once has the real Bezella shown up in person...
</line><line>Layton:
...Indeed, Miss Fey. Bezella herself has been virtually <textEffects>absent</textEffects> from the Story thus far.
</line><line>Judge:
But, Inquisitor! Did she not claim the life of the Storyteller tonight?!
</line><line>Layton:
It would appear so, Your Honour. However, there is just one more thing... Consider this... Which particular "story" is every citizen of Labyrinthia most familiar with?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well...that would have to be... <textEffects>The Legendary Fire</textEffects>...right?
</line><line>Layton:
...Precisely.
</line><line>Judge:
S-surely you're not serious. As the name implies, that is but a mere legend. No one knows for certain if it occurred...
</line><line>Layton:
So they say... But the reality is, there are still <textEffects>traces</textEffects> of that terrible fire within the town today.
</line><line>Maya:
The professor's right! We've even seen some of it up close and personal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
</line>
<center><textEffects>(Hey, yeah... At the <span style="color:#E16935">Great Archive</textEffects>...)</span></center>
<line>
Judge:
You are indeed correct, Inquisitor. Littered throughout the town are burnt remnants of a fire most fierce. However...no one can say for certain what transpired back then. You see, not a soul saw what actually happened.
</line><line>Maya:
Let me see if I have this straight...there's an entire town full of people and NO ONE saw what happened?
</line><line>Layton:
...Correct. Except for one particular person.
</line><line>Maya:
What?
</line><line>Layton:
There is one person who saw everything. I am speaking, of course, of the one responsible for the fire itself...the Great Witch Bezella.
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>...Yes...</center>
<line>Espella:
</line>
<center>I...<textEffects>remember</textEffects> it. All of it...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
E-Espella, what are you saying?!
</line><line>Espella:
</line>
<center>...When I close my eyes, I can picture it so vividly... ...The awful sight of the flames engulfing everything they touched... ...The scorching heat on my skin. ...The smell of burning cinder all around me. ...The large plumes of black smoke. ...The warm tears streaming down my face. I...remember it all...</center>
<line>
Darklaw:
What you are recalling now...is the <textEffects>moment</textEffects> the Great Witch Bezella destroyed our town. Well, it appears my role here is finished. As for the rest... I leave it in your capable hands, Inquisitor.
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?! <textEffects>(Darklaw... She...)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>(just vanished into thin air!)</textEffects></center>
<line>
Espella:
</line>
<center>...She's right. These <textEffects>memories</textEffects>... ...are proof that I am Bezella.</center>
<line>
Maya:
But, Espella...
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
Remember, if you will, what I said at the beginning of this trial. I came here to prove that Espella Cantabella is, in reality, the Great Witch Bezella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right...
</line><line>Layton:
There is still one more thing I wish to present to the court. I would now like to call the final witness to the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-the final <textEffects>witness</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Storyteller:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Shout_matta.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905154731" class="image"><img alt="Shout matta.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout matta.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_matta.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Shout_matta.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905154731" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Layton:
Ah... It would appear he has arrived. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I give you this trial's final witness...the Storyteller.
</line>
<hr />
<center>And just like that, he appeared... The man who "died" not hours before... and the victim of this very trial... ...The Storyteller himself... ...The professor sure chose one heck of a final witness... ...Morning is drawing closer and closer. How this trial will end is anyone's guess.</center>
<line>
</line>
<center>To Be Continued...</center>
