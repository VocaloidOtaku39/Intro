Iris:
Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all.
</line><line>Iris:
... ......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is no time to be embarrassed!
</line><line>Iris:
I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!
</line><line>Iris:
Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.
</line><line>Iris:
Sister Bikini...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.
</line><line>Iris:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?
</line><line>Iris:
... That is correct. It wasn't me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Very well then.
</line><line>Iris:
Um... Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes?
</line><line>Iris:
You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.
</line><line>Iris:
Y-You have...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.
</line><line>Iris:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what a friend of mine told me once.
</line><line>Iris:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide... ...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.
</line><line>Iris:
... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands.

District CourtCourtroom No. 7</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Indeed.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...

</line><line>???:
The prosecution... stands ready.
</line><line>Judge:
A-And you are...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.
</line><line>Judge:
V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?
</line><line>von Karma:
... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?
</line><line>von Karma:
... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.
</line><line>Judge:
There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!
</line><line>von Karma:
...I told you, there is no such weakling!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom!
</line><line>Judge:
B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I have no objection to the whip.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You don't...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!
</line><line>von Karma:
This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.
</line><line>Judge:
Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!
</line><line>von Karma:
The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.
</line><line>Judge:
The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a <textEffects>witness</textEffects> to her crime.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.
</line><line>Judge:
H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.
</line><line>Bikini:
Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.
</line><line>Judge:
... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You want me to leave!?
</line><line>Bikini:
No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.
</line><line>Bikini:
That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...
</line><line>Judge:
Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Night of the Murder --</textEffects></center>
<line>Bikini:
That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...
Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.
So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.
There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.
It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?
</line><line>Bikini:
...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.
</line>

<center><textEffects>-- The Night of the Murder --</textEffects></center>
<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There is indeed <span style="color:#E16935">only one</textEffects> problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this "Demon-Warding Hood", correct?
</line><line>Bikini:
Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.
</line><line>von Karma:
W... What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!
</line><line>Bikini:
Well well well!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?
</line><line>Bikini:
Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.
</line><line>Judge:
I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?
</line><line>Bikini:
Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.
</line><line>Bikini:
I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...
</line><line>von Karma:
Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the Judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... <span style="color:#E16935">Contradictory</textEffects> stimulation.)</span>

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- After My Bath --</textEffects></center>
<line>Bikini:
I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.
And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...
Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!
Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.
The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?

<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.</textEffects>

</line>

<line>Bikini:
<textEffects>The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.
</line><line>Bikini:
Oh please do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?
</line><line>von Karma:
T-The autopsy report...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim did fall from a  height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was <textEffects>after</textEffects> she was killed.
</line><line>von Karma:
Ah...!
</line><line>Judge:
T-That's right! It says "after death" right here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Aaah!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in <textEffects>her room</textEffects>... Don't you agree?
</line><line>von Karma:
Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the  courtyard below!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.
</line><line>Judge:
...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.
</line><line>Judge:
When it produces the most blood...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be <textEffects>when the blade is removed</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a <textEffects>lid</textEffects> on the wound.
</line><line>Judge:
That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!
</line><line>von Karma:
We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
...Hmph...
</line><line>Judge:
It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!
</line><line>Bikini:
Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!
</line><line>von Karma:
Sister. Please give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...With the whip?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bikini:
...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...

<line>Bikini:
When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.
Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.
I've never seen so much blood before...
That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?
And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...
</line><line>von Karma:
Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.
</line><line>Bikini:
W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.
</line><line>von Karma:
What contradictions are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its <textEffects>hilt</textEffects> into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon <textEffects>smoothly</textEffects> from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
Explain yourself!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
"Doesn't appear"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!
</line><line>Judge:
The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.
</line><line>von Karma:
T-That's...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a "plug" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!

T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not finished. There is still one more... <textEffects>conclusive contradiction</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You've still got more!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the <textEffects>hilt</textEffects>... ...why is there only blood on the <textEffects>tip</textEffects> of it?
</line><line>von Karma:
Ah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the <textEffects>entire length</textEffects> of the sword!
</line><line>von Karma:
Noooooo!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!
</line><line>von Karma:
Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!
</line><line>Judge:
But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.
</line><line>von Karma:
And that is...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!
</line><line>Judge:
W-Whaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>von Karma:
A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?
</line><line>Bikini:
W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a <textEffects>sword-like object</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.
</line><line>Judge:
The obvious... question?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes. Namely... Where did the <textEffects>real murder weapon</textEffects> disappear to?
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a "sword-like object" was found.
</line><line>von Karma:
T-That's...
</line><line>Judge:
Answer the question, Ms. von Karma!
</line><line>von Karma:
... No evidence of that kind was found.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!
</line><line>Bikini:
Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...
</line><line>von Karma:
...What is it, Sister?
</line><line>Bikini:
I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...
</line><line>Judge:
... What exactly are you going on aboot here?
</line><line>Bikini:
The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You what!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.

<line>Bikini:
I saw the murder at around 11 PM...
And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.
And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the <textEffects>snowmobile</textEffects> had been used!
It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!
Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?
...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...

<line>Judge:
Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.
</line><line>Bikini:
Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.
</line><line>von Karma:
Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.
</line><line>Judge:
A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...
</line><line>von Karma:
The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!
</line><line><textEffects>Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.
</line><line>von Karma:
You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only <textEffects>one</textEffects> set of tracks?
</line><line>von Karma:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be <textEffects>two</textEffects> sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to
the bridge, and those from coming back.
</line><line>Bikini:
... Ah...! You're right!
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>von Karma:
On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were <textEffects>erased by the snowfall</textEffects>. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!
</line><line>Judge:
I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.
</line><line>von Karma:
What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that <span style="color:#E16935">the snowfall covered one set</textEffects> of tracks...?)</span>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.
</line><line>von Karma:
... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.
</line><line>Judge:
On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! <textEffects>Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!</textEffects>
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Edgeworth:
Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that <textEffects>courtyard</textEffects> when the victim was stabbed...
</line><line>von Karma:
That's right. But proving that is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Incredibly easy.
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just <textEffects>one exception</textEffects>.
</line><line>von Karma:
And that is...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim herself, <textEffects>Ms. Elise Deauxnim</textEffects>! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!
</line><line>von Karma:
Gnnngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!
</line><line>von Karma:
Aaaaah!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...)</textEffects> This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. 
</line><line>von Karma:
Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmmm...
</line><line>Bikini:
Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...
</line><line>von Karma:
...What does, Sister?
</line><line>Bikini:
There is only one key for the snowmobile.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>von Karma:
Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!
</line><line>Bikini:
...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the <textEffects>Inner Temple</textEffects>...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(But... Iris said that she <span style="color:#E16935">never went there</textEffects>... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)</span>
</line><line>Bikini:
The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.
</line><line>Judge:
...That sounds right.
</line><line>Bikini:
But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I <textEffects>didn't see anything</textEffects> near Dusky Bridge.
</line><line>von Karma:
Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.
</line><line>Bikini:
Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-But that... isn't possible!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?
</line><line>von Karma:
...Nngh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness <textEffects>couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate</textEffects>. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be <textEffects>two</textEffects> sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmmmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
... I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...
</line><line>Bikini:
Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything, everything that I know.
</line><line>Judge:
Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem. If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A <span style="color:#E16935">witness</textEffects>, huh...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?
</line><line>Bikini:
... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmmm... That's a shame.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Your Honor! I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.
</line><line>Judge:
R-Really!?
</line><line>von Karma:
...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.
</line><line>Judge:
Which are...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First... that he saw "<textEffects>something incredible</textEffects>" on the night of the murder.
</line><line>von Karma:
...And the second being?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
This guy must be a product of "Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.
</line><line>Judge:
Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
T-That's... <textEffects>(I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.)</textEffects> He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.
</line><line>von Karma:
And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.
</line><line>Judge:
Summon this youth as a witness immediately!
</line><line>von Karma:
... I have no choice, do I?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.
</line><line>von Karma:
...Understood, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Good... Well then! Court is now in recess!

Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.
</line><line>Iris:
...Alright. I'll help
you any way I can.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.
</line><line>Iris:
... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?
</line><line>Iris:
... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?
</line><line>Iris:
... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.

Judge:
...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?
</line><line>von Karma:
During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Suspicious behavior...?
</line><line>von Karma:
He was sketching something... Very intensely.
</line><line>Judge:
Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?
</line><line>von Karma:
He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.
</line><line>Judge:
... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!

Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!

<line>Judge:
Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?
</line><line>von Karma:
So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?
</line><line>Butz:
It was like me after a three day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.
</line><line>von Karma:
W-What did you say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.
</line><line>von Karma:
As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...
</line><line>Judge:
Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>That's when I ran into Nick.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Butz:
<textEffects>I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Butz:
<textEffects>I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...
</line><line>Butz:
What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is <textEffects>time</textEffects>.
</line><line>Butz:
I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. "Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?" Terrible at those.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?
</line><line>Butz:
Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at <textEffects>10:45 PM</textEffects>. You say it takes <textEffects>less than five minutes</textEffects> from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around <textEffects>11 PM</textEffects>.
</line><line>Butz:
...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is impossible.
</line><line>von Karma:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
11 PM is <textEffects>when the murder occurred</textEffects> in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the <textEffects>courtyard</textEffects>. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Butz:
Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an <textEffects>objection</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
You do?
</line><line>Butz:
Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, "around 11". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!
</line><line>von Karma:
And why not!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took <textEffects>around 30 minutes</textEffects> for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least <textEffects>11:15 PM</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Which means... what, exactly?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright <textEffects>did not see</textEffects> the bridge as it was burning that night. He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down! ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at <textEffects>11 PM</textEffects>. Wright did not make it there until <textEffects>at least 11:15</textEffects>... Are you still trying to hide something from us!? What happened during these <textEffects>missing 15 minutes</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Butz:
Urk... I... I feel like I just woke up... I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>von Karma:
...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!
</line><line>Butz:
Yeah! Not much of a problem at all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?
</line><line>Judge:
Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is the problem here... Even after the bridge <textEffects>burnt out</textEffects>, he was still there! He simply stood there and didn't report anything.
</line><line>von Karma:
Th-That's what it sounds like...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid. There has to be a <textEffects>reason</textEffects> for his inaction!
</line><line>Butz:
... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.
</line><line>Butz:
Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-Yes...
</line><line>Butz:
I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Then say it!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?

Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!
The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!
...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.

Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...

<textEffects>(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.
</line><line>Judge:
And what would that be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Imagined what?

That Laurice Deauxnim's debut would take place here, today, like this! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch!

OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim!

</line><line>von Karma:
Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected.
</line><line>Butz:
Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did!

</line><line>Butz:
What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...?
</line><line>Butz:
Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However much I might want to ignore it... I can't.
</line><line>Butz:
It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly.
</line><line>Butz:
OK.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...?
</line><line>Butz:
Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are...!
</line><line>von Karma:
You...!
</line><line>Judge:
High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture!

Uwaaah! What was that for!?
</line><line>von Karma:
...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory!
</line><line>Judge:
Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Actually, there is some precedent for this.
</line><line>Butz:
She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth!

Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here!

Y-Yes, Your Honor... <textEffects>(Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.
</line><line>Butz:
In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.
</line><line>Judge:
What might that be...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!
</line><line>Butz:
W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!
</line><line>von Karma:
A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?
</line><line>Butz:
Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?
</line><line>Butz:
W-What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I think you understand what I mean just fine.
</line><line>Butz:
Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?

Eh...?

Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!

Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!

Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And it was half-buried in the snow...?
</line><line>Butz:
It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(They look nothing alike!)</textEffects> In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime!

</line><line>von Karma:
That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>After the murder</textEffects>?
</line><line>von Karma:
There is <textEffects>blood</textEffects> on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away <textEffects>after</textEffects> the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!
</line><line>Butz:
... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh!
</line><line>von Karma:
Enough joking... Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped <span style="color:#E16935">before</textEffects> the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time!

Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth.

...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case!

<line>Edgeworth:
This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?
</line><line>Butz:
That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear.
</line><line>Judge:
W-What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When the crystal sphere was dropped, <textEffects>it was snowing</textEffects>, even if it was ever so slightly...
</line><line>von Karma:
Snowing...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is <textEffects>no snow</textEffects> on the victim's body.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped <textEffects>before</textEffects> the murder!
</line><line>von Karma:
Wha... Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!
</line><line>Judge:
What... What could that have been!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This sphere... There is some <textEffects>blood</textEffects> on it, isn't there?
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was <textEffects>near the foot of Dusky Bridge</textEffects>!
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma?
</line><line>von Karma:
Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon <textEffects>being removed</textEffects> from the victim's body.
</line><line>von Karma:
Th-That's the same thing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No, it isn't!
</line><line>von Karma:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You said it yourself.
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be <textEffects>when the blade is removed</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding!
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in <textEffects>Hazakura Temple</textEffects>! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove the <span style="color:#E16935">possibility</textEffects> it happened as I presume...!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. <textEffects>Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile.
</line><line>von Karma:
Ah...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean!?
</line><line>von Karma:
The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation!
</line><line>von Karma:
W-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean?
</line><line>von Karma:
Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is <textEffects>something that actually happened</textEffects>. The defense stands firm on this point.
</line><line>Butz:
Ed-Edgey! Thank you...!
</line><line>Judge:
...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances.
</line><line>von Karma:
Grrr... Grrrrrr!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...)</textEffects> It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner.
</line><line>von Karma:
Excuse me...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright!
</line><line>Butz:
R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch!
</line><line>von Karma:
Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.
</line><line>Butz:
What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy!
</line><line>von Karma:
...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for!
</line><line>Butz:
Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch!
</line><line>von Karma:
I demand satisfaction!
</line><line>Judge:
...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Court is now adjourned!
