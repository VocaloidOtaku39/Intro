Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well, I never expected this. Who'd have thought we'd be back here again so soon?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
We are on a study tour of Great Britain...with the intention of learning the country's legal practices. In order to research the latest court procedures here, we need as much court experience as possible.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, I suppose that's true, but... ...for the person in the dock, it may well be his or her one and only time in court. And it could be life-changing. In which case, treating it  as 'research' may seem a little... crass.
</line><line>Susato:
...Oh, when you put it like that... You're quite right.
</line>
<center>Good morning!</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Mr Natsume. Good morning.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear, are you alright? Your eyes are terribly bloodshot.
</line><line>Soseki:
'The early bird catches the worm,' as they say here in Britain.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I've heard that expression.
</line><line>Soseki:
But I really don't want to catch a worm. SO I TRIED DESPERATELY NOT TO WAKE UP EARLY! BUT I WAS SO WORRIED, I COULDN'T <textEffects>CATCH A WINK</textEffects>! ...And now I'm absolutely exhausted as a result.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Do all literary people take things so...literally?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Thank you for putting your faith in us today, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:
......... I, I WISH I HAD NINE LIVES! MY WHOLE FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE! I'M...
</line>
<center>Too Terrified To Tremble!</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Really? Because I can feel tremors in the floor.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
I can't do this! I can't take it! Although...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...yes?
</line><line>Soseki:
I caught a glimpse of the public gallery as I walked by the courtroom. It looked like the opening night of the opera, there were so many people. I had no idea my case was such a notorious affair here in London.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh. Um... <textEffects>(Neither did I.)</textEffects> Do you know why that might be, Miss Susato?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I have no idea.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So that all-knowing look on your face is just coincidence then, is it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH FROM ME! ...It's...it's... ...it's because of <textEffects>the Reaper</textEffects>, isn't it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(Lord van Zieks?!)</textEffects> Is, is that right, Miss Susato?
</line><line>Susato:
...I purchased as many different newspapers as I could find this morning, and yes... ...Lord van Zieks is on the front page of every one.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I knew it!
</line><line>Susato:
Sometime after the prosecutor was dubbed 'The Reaper of the Bailey'... ...he stopped appearing in court, it seems. It's been several years now, in fact, until the day before yesterday.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Inspector Gregson told us something similar, didn't he?
</line>
<center>The trial two days ago marked Lord van Zieks's return to the courtroom after a very long hiatus. <textEffects>(The trial of Magnus McGilded... Ugh, what a harrowing experience that was.)</textEffects></center>
<line>
Susato:
I believe that appearance made even greater waves here in the capital than today's.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But we wouldn't have realised, of course, having only just arrived in the country.
</line><line>Susato:
'Why is the Reaper back in the Bailey so soon, for what appears to be a mundane murder?' That's the question the papers are asking. And they are all speculating various answers.
</line><line>Soseki:
'Mundane'? MUNDANE?! It's the most significant saga of the century to some of us!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear! I meant no offence, Mr Natsume! But...that is how the papers are describing it.
</line><line>Soseki:
Well, lest we also forget the fact that it could spark an international incident. Obviously, the reappearance of this infamous prosecutor has caught people's attention. But there's another blatant <textEffects>similarity</textEffects> with the trial of two days ago.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, I agree.
</line><line>Soseki:
Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire... It's <textEffects>you</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Me...? <textEffects>(Well, I suppose that's true.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
Both times, it is you who stands against this legendary prosecutor. It, it can only mean...THAT YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE REAPER!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Please! I don't rub shoulders with...with...death-bringers!
</line><line>Susato:
I'm afraid that there's really only one other explanation. It can only be another example, Mr Naruhodo, of your uncommon <textEffects>bad luck</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Thanks for that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh, this is just my luck! Why must I be represented by a man with such frail fortune? By the LEAST LUCKY LAWYER ALIVE!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Well, let's not forget... ...that it was you, Mr Natsume, who asked me to represent you.
</line><line>Soseki:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's true that I'm just a student, new to London, with little in the way of experience or skills...or luck. But I promise you this... ...I will fight your corner until the bitter end. And I will believe in you, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh, benevolent Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
</line><line>Susato:
You're not alone here with us, Mr Natsume. Whatever happens, we will always be on your side!
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh, benevolent Non-Locum Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress... ......... I AM IN YOUR DEBT! FOREVER! I shall never forget this great kindness for as long as I live!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Mr Natsume! Counsel for the Defence! The court session is about to begin. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright then, Mr Natsume, it's time. Let's go.
</line><line>Soseki:
Y-Y-Ye... Y-Y-Ye... YEEESSSSSS!!!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
</line>
<center><textEffects>(This is it... My second appearance in a British courtroom. And my second trial against...the Reaper. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma. Because this time, I won't let my faith waver. I'll believe in my client to the last. Just like you believed in me... ...I believe I can do this now! I'm ready for this fight!)</textEffects></center>

<center><textEffects>20th February, 10:00 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution is fully prepared, My Lord.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The defence...is ready, My Lord!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... The Nipponese are a truly fascinating breed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry, what?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Lord Stronghart has told me all about you. That you are a student who arrived in London but two days ago. A mere amateur.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do, do you have a point?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Being a compatriot, you feel compelled to try to help the accused, I suppose. ...Typical Nipponese arrogance.
</line><line>Susato:
...Forgive me, but I do not believe arrogance is an appropriate description.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Susato-san...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
After all, at our previous encounter, the defendant was found to be innocent.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Very true. And a most fascinating - if dark - trial it was, too. The tragic conclusion came later, of course. Here's to the acquitted, and his unfortunate <textEffects>violent end</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsels. I see both sides are in fine fettle. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are you ready to carry out your duties here in court as impartial members of the public?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
You never know when you might be down on your luck. But I believe in fair play for everyone.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Well I must warn you, I'm rather more ruthless than I appear.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Oh well, not me. What you see is what you get. I'm a peace-loving fellow.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I'm afraid to say, I think it's quite possible that moustached foreigner did the deed.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Come on, what are we waiting for? No doubt he did it, anyway.
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, let us proceed. Your opening statement, if you please, Lord van Zieks.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Very recently, Great Britain signed an alliance with a rising power in the Far East. The accused in the dock today is a student from that same land. A certain Mr Soseki Natsume. And while our country has extended this foreign student the warmest of welcomes... ...regrettably the kindness has not been returned. In fact, this student is accused of a most sinister act. Of plunging a knife into the back of an innocent woman who was doing nothing but walking down the street!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
A knife crime?! I tell you from bitter experience, those are the worst! Bloody oath, they are!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Just look at that sallow complexion and short stature... He's, he's one of those dreadful 'Japanese'!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Come on, let's get this over with. With me now, everyone. One, two...three!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Pray...forgive the discourtesy of smashing my hallowed chalice here in this great chamber. Allow me to call the first witness to the stand.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Bailiff, lead the inspector in, please!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
Your name and occupation, please.
</line><line>Gregson:
Yes, sir. Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Would you please summarise the events of the case for the court, Inspector?
</line><line>Gregson:
The victim is thought to be a young woman in her twenties by the name of Olive Green.
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon, Inspector? '<textEffects>Thought to be</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Gregson:
Yes, havin' been stabbed in the back by her attacker's knife, the victim fell unconscious. That was three days ago now. And she's been <textEffects>comatose ever since</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! <textEffects>(So they don't even know who she is for sure?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, comatose... I see. But her life is not in danger?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Fortunately for the Eastern student, the charge will not be murder. Pray, elaborate on the details, Inspector.
</line><line>Gregson:
Sir. If I could ask everyone to look at this street map... As I mentioned, the incident took place three days ago. ...At around five in the afternoon. It happened <textEffects>on the pavement</textEffects> running alongside Briar Road, a wide thoroughfare for horse-drawn vehicles. It had not long since stopped snowin' as the victim - Miss Green - was walkin' down the street. Out of the blue, she was approached from behind by the accused and stabbed in the back. Luckily, the young lady's life was spared, and she's currently bein' treated in one of the city's hospitals. But bein' unconscious as she is, we've been unable to take a statement from her, of course. This is the case file with everything we know about the victim so far.
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Inspector. The court will accept the documents as evidence, if you please.
</line><line><textEffects>The case file has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What of <textEffects>the weapon</textEffects> that was used?
</line><line>Gregson:
Sir. I have that here. It was removed from the victim's back.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ouch. That big thing is starting to make me scared to walk down the street now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
With a heavy blade like that, almost anybody would have been able to stab the poor woman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Even the scragged-looking Soseki-san, I suppose...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... A common-or-garden jackknife, I would say. Rather nondescript. Thank you, Inspector. The court accepts the blade as evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>The jackknife has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then...what do we know of the motive? <textEffects>Money or valuables</textEffects>, I presume?
</line>

<line>Gregson:
From what we can tell by looking at the woman's possessions, it seems like she's a poor student herself. Hard to imagine she would have had anythin' much worth pinchin', My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Well, in that case, are we looking at some deep-seated <textEffects>resentment</textEffects> toward the victim?
</line><line>Gregson:
...I'm afraid I couldn't say. Apart from visitin' secondhand bookshops, the defendant, Mr Natsume, doesn't appear to get out much. At this moment in time, we haven't been able to establish any sort of connection between him and the victim.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If theft and grievance had been ruled out as the motive... ...what reason could Mr Natsume possibly have had for stabbing the young woman? Yet you arrested the man in spite of that...in a totally unjustified and heavy-handed way!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging a freshly uncorked bottle into the public gallery... ...but your words have soured its hallowed bouquet. For it is you, my learned friend, who is being heavy-handed here.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Scotland Yard does not arrest people without good cause. That should be beyond question. Inspector Gregson, the prosecution calls for your formal testimony. Explain to the court precisely why the constabulary came to arrest the Nipponese student.
</line><line>Gregson:
Yes, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- Mr Natsume's Arrest -</textEffects></center>
<line>Gregson:
As I said, it was five o'clock in the afternoon when the incident occurred. And there was an unusually light fog.
Visibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.
Out of the blue, the victim was stabbed from behind and subsequently collapsed on the pavement.
The accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.
Those bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems.
It was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Old books, you say?
</line><line>Gregson:
Yes, My Lord. I have a photograph here of the scene of the crime, taken immediately after the incident.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah yes, I can clearly see <textEffects>the books</textEffects> to which you are referring. I will take that photographic print as evidence, please, Inspector.
</line><line><textEffects>The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You Nipponese are a spineless breed. Too cowardly to admit defeat. Denying everything despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...I...
</line><line>Susato:
Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but the defendant is not denying '<textEffects>everything</textEffects>', as you put it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What are you doing, Miss Susato?
</line><line>Judge:
Do go on...
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Natsume has admitted to playing some part in the incident. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well, now you mention it... ...when we visited him in the prison yesterday, he did tell us what had all happened.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Soseki:
As I was walking along that accursed pavement, I could make out the sole silhouette of another ahead of me. A woman, wearing a green overcoat, she was. And just as I went to overtake her... ...she suddenly let out a little scream, and collapsed onto the cold, hard slabs of stone at my feet! I was terrified! I had to get away from there! So I ran! As fast as my legs would carry me back to my accursed lodgings!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Juror No. 1:
Hmph, a green overcoat?
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Well that's exactly what the woman in that print is wearing!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh my! A photographic print in full colour! What will the world come up with next?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The defendant has done nothing more than admit he fled the scene of a terrifying incident! That does NOT mean that he's guilty of the heinous crime of stabbing the woman in the back!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
There was nobody else there at the time. Just <textEffects>the two of them</textEffects>: the victim...and the accused. In other words, there is <textEffects>nobody else</textEffects> who could possibly have stabbed the woman. A fact...that the accused concedes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, it seems this cross-examination could prove to be pivotal, Counsel. Proceed, please.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! <textEffects>(Nothing for it... I have to use this cross-examination to turn the tables here. It's our only chance!)</textEffects>

<line>Gregson:
<textEffects>He was on his way home from Bourbon Books, a secondhand bookshop he apparently patronises.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregson:
<textEffects>It was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? If you're unable to sway the jury during this cross-examination, I'm afraid-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed? Yes, they're sure to find him guilty. So one way or another... ...I have to expose an undeniable <textEffects>inconsistency</textEffects> in the inspector's testimony!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Um...if, if I could just stop you there, Inspector Gregson...
</line><line>Gregson:
What is it, sunshine? I'm a busy man, you know!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This is a receipt that we found in Mr Natsume's room. It was issued on the day of the incident, and details the purchase of three secondhand books.
</line><line>Gregson:
And you found that in the accused's room, did you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, but the point is not where the receipt was found, but <textEffects>the name of the shop</textEffects> printed on it.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Go on.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This receipt was issued from a bookshop called...<textEffects>Yore Books</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yore Books? Y-o-r-e, I presume...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. So Mr Natsume did indeed purchase a number of books at a secondhand bookshop that day. However! The bookshop in question...was not Bourbon Books!
</line><line>Gregson:
Eh? What?
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector! Do you know of this other bookshop?
</line><line>Gregson:
Y-Yes sir! Yore Books is another secondhand bookshop not far from Bourbon Books. It's just that... Well, it's such a small place, I, I didn't think the accused would have known about it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But in fact that IS the bookshop which the defendant visited on the day in question. And this receipt proves it!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I disagree! I, I mean...after all, um...
</line><line>Susato:
I have the street map here, if that might be of help?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... Yes! Thank you! Have a look at this, please... If the defendant had been returning from Bourbon Books... ...then yes, he would almost certainly have passed the place where Miss Green was attacked. However! If we take into account the fact that he was actually at another bookshop - Yore Books... ...it may very well turn out that <textEffects>he wouldn't have passed that location</textEffects> at all!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...! Could that be true?
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
My my, it rather depends on where this other bookshop is, but I do declare it may be a possibility...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Is that right, Mr Lawyer, sir? What you just said?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Absolutely! It absolutely could be right!
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector Gregson! Where is this Yore Books establishment?
</line><line>Gregson:
Well, um, obviously we looked into that. It turns out that Yore Books... ...is just here on the next corner of Meerschaum Street goin' east.
</line><line><textEffects>The local map's information has been updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And there you have it! As you can clearly see now... ......... ...Oh.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...My learned Nipponese friend is obviously in training to be a clown, the way he regales us with such witticisms. To your future career in the circus.
</line><line>Susato:
Grrr...you put that glass down now, or I'll put it down for you!
</line><line>Gregson:
I, erm...didn't think I needed to spell it out, but here we go. If the accused was comin' home from Yore Books instead of Bourbon Books... ...there's no doubt he still would have passed the place where the victim was stabbed.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, thank you, Inspector.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Allow me to reiterate for my learned, if somewhat slow, Nipponese friend... Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in <textEffects>the final analysis</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAGH!!!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
As I suspected! You can't fool me! And I don't suggest you try!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
What did I say, eh? I've had enough of this now!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Beg your pardon? Terribly sorry, but would you mind repeating that?
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! We mustn't give up!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What, what do you mean?
</line><line>Susato:
If the prosecution's assertion is correct... ...the members of the jury may very well decide that Mr Natsume is guilty!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! <textEffects>(She's absolutely right!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
We must think! We must consider the assertion just put forward by the prosecution very, very carefully!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(They claim Soseki-san must have passed the location of the incident on his way home from Yore Books, but...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Explain yourself, Counsel!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm, yes, My Lord! You, you can see what I mean on this map! When returning from Yore Books to his lodgings... ...Mr Natsume could have followed the route suggested by the prosecution. However... ...that isn't the only conceivable route to take between the two places. If the defendant used these streets...look what happens! He arrives back at his lodgings without passing the location where the victim was attacked!

</line><line>Van Zieks:
Talking back to a clown is a fool's errand, of course. However, I feel compelled to point out that... ...that route is what is commonly referred to as <textEffects>the long way round</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
On a cold winter's night, why would any man choose to take a longer route home?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, um...erm...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The answer is extremely simple: He wouldn't. In other words... ...the accused took the obvious route back to his lodgings, and is the obvious perpetrator of this crime!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...but...BUT! Ah-ha, yes! I've got it! Obviously, we must ask the man himself! Ask Mr Natsume which route he took home!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I have already informed the court of the accused's response to such questioning. He claims he has 'no recollection'.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Haah...
</line><line>Gregson:
That's right. As I said, the bloke seems to spend his time outside wanderin' aimlessly from A to B. That day was no exception. He says he doesn't remember where he was or which route he took home.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I don't... I DON'T BELIEVE THIIIS!!!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...I thank you, my learned friend. And suggest that we do not waste any more of the court's time by wandering aimlessly around this subject. Pray, what say you insightful jurors?

</line><line>Juror No. 1:
We members of the jury...are completely <textEffects>convinced</textEffects> now!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, in that case I hereby call upon all members of the jury... ...to present your findings to the court!

To the insightful members of the jury. I applaud your brave resolve. You serve Queen and country admirably.
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(No...not yet... This isn't over yet! I still have one last chance to <span style="color:#E16935">sway the opinion</textEffects> of the jury. I have to tip the balance of those scales the other way. I have to <textEffects>turn this around</textEffects>... ...somehow!)</span>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Hm, those are the eyes of quarry not yet willing to give up and die.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So I presume you intend to wield your rights again in this trial. Rights of the defence written into antiquated British law that should have been buried long ago.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Call it antiquated if you will... ...but it's the defence's prerogative to carry out a summation examination if it so chooses!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Counsel... ...in accordance with the letter of the law, we shall proceed with a summation examination. Are the members of the jury ready, Mr Foreman?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Of course we're ready! I'm all too familiar with that Nipponese whippersnapper and his onkus refusal to throw in his alley.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain <textEffects>on what grounds</textEffects> you have determined the defendant to be guilty!

<line>Juror No. 1:
For pity's sake, that little Nipponese oddity already admitted it himself, didn't he?
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
If he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop. Not in winter!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
So the poor woman was attacked from behind, was she? How dreadful!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
I really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Hm, Yore Books, yes... Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmmm... With only minor exceptions, the reasons for finding the defendant guilty are all too clear.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
When the stabbing occurred, the only two people at the scene were the victim and the accused. And the accused himself... ...has admitted to seeing the victim in her green overcoat sink to the ground before his eyes.
</line><line>Judge:
Furthermore, we have heard from the inspector that the defendant then fled the scene. I must say, I would have ample grounds to convict this man already.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear, even the judge appears convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh, why did he have to run away like that? And how are we supposed to believe in some phantom attacker that nobody could see? This is impossible! How can I possibly make a case for the defence?
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! This is no time for grumbling! If we want to force the trial to continue-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. I have to <textEffects>turn the tide</textEffects>. I must make the jurors change their minds. Well, four of them, at least.
</line><line>Susato:
Exactly. We have no choice but to forge forward!
</line><line>Judge:
You have the floor, Counsel. Begin your summation examination.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. <textEffects>(I just need to keep this trial going somehow. Whatever it takes... Come on, Ryunosuke, you can do it!)</textEffects>

<line>Judge:
Well, that summation examination has concluded with a rather large shift in opinion. The ayes, two. The noes, four. So the noes have it. Not guilty, they say. Which means we no longer have a consensus among the members of the jury. The trial will continue!

L-Lord van Zieks...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It seems I must retract my earlier remark.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I mistakenly credited these jurors with intelligence by describing them as 'insightful'. Yet we have just witnessed them falling for a cheap trick performed by an Eastern 'entertainer'.

Eh?

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I haven't tricked anyone! Everything I've said is the truth!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Indeed... Stalwart juror number five was undoubtedly repairing the road, as he claims. I believe you said it was 'a good two yards' of the pavement which you had excavated, sir?
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
That's right. Took me the whole day and they paid me a measly tuppence for it!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Now, my learned Nipponese friend, tell me... ...do you have any notion of the distance that two yards represents?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Um, well... <textEffects>(If I'm honest, I don't have a clue, no...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Two yards is...a little less than two metres.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Less than two metres? <textEffects>(That's...not much at all!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
In other words, a distance readily vaulted by anyone of moderate vigour. ...Would you not agree, my stalwart friend?
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Eh? Me? Well, I can't say you're wrong, no.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And did you perchance erect a sign to prevent pedestrians from passing the site of your works?
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Eh? I wouldn't dream of it! What a waste of time! No coaches would have had a hope of passing anyway, and we just turn any gentlefolk back when they come. Kids just jump right over us all the time.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...The accused is no gentleman, as far as I can see. I have little doubt, however, that he could spring over a two-yard trench in his meanderings around town.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Ah!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Is that true? Is it?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The incontrovertible truth is that the books just purchased by the accused were found at the scene. There can be no doubt that on his way back to his lodgings, Mr Natsume walked down Briar Road.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(Crushed...in a single sentence...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And...old man...
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
C-Cold man?! ...You can talk!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You say that around five o'clock on the day in question, you slipped and fell on Calabash Road. Pray, was there a suspicious-looking Nipponese behind you at the time?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Oh! I, I, um...can't say as I remember.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You, you don't remember?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
How about a wager, my learned friend? You say it was this old man that the accused saw. But I would lay a thousand to one...against you being able to prove it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAARGH!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Lord van Zieks, explain yourself!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
If you had such a trenchant argument up your sleeve... ...why in the world did you not proffer it during the summation examination?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Hmph... I wanted to give this young foreign student the sightseeing experience he no doubt came for. I wanted him to see for himself how the opinion of the jury is so <textEffects>readily swayed</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But my hospitality has its limits. And they have been reached, I feel. So, my learned friend...today's sightseeing tour of London is now over.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What, what are you talking about?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My Lord! The prosecution requests permission to call its next witnesses to the stand.
</line><line>Judge:
Granted. Bailiff! Bring forth the witnesses!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Its...next witnesses?
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, do you not remember? We've been told on several occasions that there were eye witnesses to the incident.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember. One of them being a Scotland Yard <textEffects>policeman</textEffects>, no less.
</line><line>Susato:
I'm afraid that's likely to be the prosecution's next witness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Alright, no matter who van Zieks brings to the stand as his witnesses, and no matter what they say... ...I believe in Soseki-san! I know he's innocent! And I'll keep believing to the very end. Until this battle is over!)</textEffects>

<line>Van Zieks:
Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.

</line><line>Roly:
Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah. .........
</line><line>Patricia:
And I'm Mrs. Beate! Patricia's my name. I'm proud to say I'm this young town hero's wife!
</line><line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...what's the story here?
</line><line>Patricia:
Well, in truth, we've not been married long. In fact, we celebrated our first anniversary only the other day!
</line><line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No no, it was your husband I was asking about. He seems...tired.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Hardly surprising. Whilst being an honourable occupation, patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, really? <textEffects>(I'm sure I've heard that before, actually.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed, apart from rare days off, our gallant officers trudge some twenty miles a day, you know. They patrol boarding houses and pubs, collect taxes, survey the streets, check that meters are reading true... And they're responsible for keeping the streets clean, and lighting and extinguishing our streetlights.
</line><line>Susato:
There are a number of items on that list that don't sound much like policing duties at all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I wouldn't just be falling asleep on my feet, I'd have collapsed long ago!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But it goes without saying that a policeman's primary duty is the apprehension of criminals. Even when he's off duty, a constable is expected to investigate and resolve any crimes on his beat. For the London bobby is a man of honour.
</line><line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...And a man of slumber.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
On the day in question... ...this man and his wife were walking down Briar Road in the opposite direction. And they witnessed the incident as it occurred. ...Is that not correct, Mr and Mrs Beate?
</line><line>Patricia:
That's right, sir! ...Isn't it, Roly?
</line><line>Roly:
......... Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What a great witness he's going to be...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very good. I'd like to hear your formal testimonies now, please. You will tell the court exactly what you saw on the afternoon of the incident.

Yes, sah!

<line>Patricia:
It was our wedding anniversary, and Roly was taking me out for a meal. There was no time to change after work.
Anyway, two silhouettes appeared out of the fog on the pavement in front of us.
All of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!
We ran straight over of course, and then went for help at a nearby police box.
It was definitely that Japanese man in the dock. Roly and I both saw him as clear as day!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well...this is extremely compelling testimony, I must say.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear, this policeman and his wife are claiming to have positively identified Mr Natsume at the scene. If their testimony is true... ...the alternative course of events that you established in the summation examination will be quashed.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Its death knell, in fact. Because that 'alternative' was never viable in the first place.
</line><line>Judge:
What an unfortunate bechancing. And on your wedding anniversary, too.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh, I know! But I still managed to go out for the evening with my man! I thank the Lord for that!
</line><line>Susato:
Gosh, the life of a London 'bobby' sounds very hard indeed.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Indeed. However... ...this cross-examination will be over in minutes. You may well have time to rest this afternoon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My learned friend, the witnesses saw the face of the man fleeing the scene. They are testifying under oath that it was without doubt the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:

The evidence is right here...in the form of this bookshop receipt!
</line><line>Judge:
From Yore Books?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, this receipt details Mr Natsume's purchases that day. But as you can see...only <textEffects>three books</textEffects> are listed.
</line><line>Patricia:
No!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Therefore Mr Natsume would have only dropped three books at the scene of the crime. Which means that your powers of observation, madam, cannot be relied upon.

Well, I hate to admit it, but on hearing the testimony... ...it really does seem as though Mr and Mrs Beate saw what they say they saw. Mr Natsume running away from the scene on Briar Road that day.
</line><line>Susato:
......... Yes, I feel the same.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So if that's true, where does it leave us?
</line><line>Susato:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no! <textEffects>(Then what do we do?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
......... If Kazuma-sama were here...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Susato:
I think he would try to find <textEffects>a contradiction</textEffects> somewhere else within their testimony.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, 'somewhere else'?
</line><line>Susato:
Their statement about seeing Mr Natsume is unequivocal. Calling that into question won't help. But if you could identify some other part of their testimony which appears to contradict the facts... ...you might be able to discredit them! To make the jury doubt if the pair's memory of the day is accurate!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...right...
</line><line>Susato:
Put simply, we must focus on finding a discrepancy in these statements somewhere. If we don't, I'm afraid the trial may reach an early and unfavourable conclusion.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(Why do I always seem to be so up against it?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Patricia:
Grrr...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So it cannot be denied... ...that though you say it was the defendant that you saw... ...you could very well <textEffects>be mistaken</textEffects>!
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh no... Oh no, oh no, oh no... NOOOOOOOOO!

</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's plainly evident... ...that it is your powers of deduction that cannot be relied upon, my learned Nipponese friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What cannot be denied is that these two witnesses saw the accused running from the scene. A fact that you know very well you have no hope of disproving.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So you've striven to avert attention from that by dint of some inconsequential discrepancies. Would that be...fair?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Ugh. <textEffects>(He sees right through me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But your plan has somewhat recoiled against you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's quite simple. Let me explain with a toast. To the policeman's wife, and her <textEffects>entirely accurate</textEffects> testimony. ...In every respect.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You see, the matter is not up for debate. At the scene on Briar Road, a total of <textEffects>four books</textEffects> were most definitely found.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But, but what about the photographic print? It only shows <textEffects>three books</textEffects>!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Quite right. Only three can be seen...in that print.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That print? You, you mean to say...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Allow me to present another! ...One that shows the victim's hand.
</line><line>I, I don't believe it!
It's...it's the fourth book!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As you will observe... ...the fourth book was hidden from view in the original print by the victim's torso.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No... NOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
</line><line>Patricia:
There! You see? You see?! Look at that! Look, look, look!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...
</line><line>Patricia:
It's just like I said! ...Isn't it, my darling?
</line><line>Roly:
Yes, SAH! Patricia's always right, sah!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let us study the receipt for the books purchased by the accused on the day in question. Mrs Beate, the titles once again, if you please.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh yes, of course. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...'The Picture of Monsieur Lecoq'.
</line><line>Patricia:
'Whatsit Yearnings'...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...'Canterbury Yearnings'.
</line><line>Patricia:
'A Meal for Someone'...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...'A Meal for Gaboriau', in fact. As the court has just heard, the witness remembers the book titles <textEffects>flawlessly</textEffects>, save for a few minor details. Mrs Beate's powers of recollection can only be described as exceptional.
</line><line>Patricia:
Did you hear that, Roly? The gentleman paid me a compliment!
</line><line>Roly:
Yes SAH! Flawless, sah! Patricia is flawless!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
B-But...there are only three books on the receipt. And Mrs Beate mentioned four.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
There's nothing surprising about that. Clearly the fourth book is that which is shown in this photographic print.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but does that not seem odd? Why should the fourth book be omitted from the receipt?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's not odd at all, My Lord. As the photograph clearly shows, the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...it <textEffects>belongs to the victim</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The victim...was holding her own book?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I wonder...what became of that fourth book?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Obviously, it wasn't overlooked by the investigating officers at Scotland Yard. I have it here, as evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
You will submit that and the aforementioned photographic print to the court, please, Counsel.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...My pleasure, My Lord.
</line><line><textEffects>The second crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>The fourth book has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution rests. I have nothing further to add.

<line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You seem surprised, my learned friend. But your resistance until now has been in vain. Entertaining, yes. But futile. The spurious longer route to the accused's lodgings that you tried to establish in your summation examination... ...and the attempted discrediting of the witness's powers of recollection in your cross-examination...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Futile...? <textEffects>(...I walked right into this, didn't I?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Patricia:
You see? Everything we've said is true! ...Isn't that right, my darling?
</line><line>Roly:
Yes, Pat! Marry me, Pat!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...So, perhaps the ladies and gentlemen of the jury would like to reconsider their positions? Should the court waste any more time on this Nipponese travesty? ...Or is the decision you have to make all too apparent already?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You have heard all of the witnesses and seen all of the evidence. This trial has run its course!
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! I'm afraid we are in a terribly precarious position!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I know! But... ...if I fight back in the wrong way now, I could very well just <textEffects>make matters worse</textEffects>! <textEffects>(Think, Ryunosuke, think! What do you do now?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Van Zieks:
No, my learned friend. It's over. That last cross-examination was your final chance to establish a credible defence. And you failed. The die has been cast. There is no more room for debate.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...it might be over as far as you're concerned, but... but... ......... <textEffects>(Argh! I can't think of what to say!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
......... ...If I may, Lord van Zieks? It seems somewhat boorish to close down the debate at this point.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Hmph. Your insignificant little Eastern isle must be a lawless hole indeed. For a lowly judicial assistant to have the audacity to intervene at a moment like this...
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! .........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I am, to my shame, still a very inexperienced lawyer. So you will have to forgive me, but I consider my assistant's advice essential and her opinions invaluable.
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... One of this land's great guiding principles is tolerance. So...the court will hear you, madam.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Go ahead, Miss Susato. ...Please.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Very well... Pray, what insight can you give us? What have we all overlooked in this matter that you see fit to pursue further?
</line><line>Susato:
......... Well, the court has been presented with <textEffects>new evidence</textEffects>, but...only after the last cross-examination finished.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. And you believe that this new evidence warrants further examination, do you?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
Um...Mr Naruhodo? What do you think? It's just possible that this new evidence might be the decisive proof we've been waiting for. The judge is sure to ask the members of the jury to announce their leanings in a moment.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
And of course, he's sure to ask you to explain what the crucial piece of evidence is and why. So we must take this opportunity to <textEffects>examine</textEffects> the newly presented evidence as thoroughly as possible!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I understand. And...thank you, Miss Susato! <textEffects>(This is it. Susato-san has managed to win us <span style="color:#E16935">one last chance</textEffects> here... I can't let it go to waste!)</span> The defence wishes to present evidence, My Lord!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. The defence may present one further piece of evidence. <textEffects>Evidence that has apparently offers a profound insight into this case, and has hitherto been overlooked.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The evidence in question is what we can see from the newly presented photographic print of the crime scene. The fourth book, found in the victim's hand.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
We have already discussed the fourth book at length. Other than it being in the victim's grasp at the time of the incident, no significance has been attached to it. Pursuing the matter further would be a flagrant waste of the court's time...as you well know.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Yes, I'm afraid, Counsel, I must concur with the prosecution on this matter. When I afforded you this opportunity... ...you led the court to believe that the evidence in question contained a hitherto undiscovered <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
So I must insist that you elaborate, Counsel. You will identify this clue at once. ...Do I make myself clear?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...yes! My Lord! It's...erm...
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...I believe the prosecution is trying to avoid a thorough examination of the evidence. Which means...you may very well be on the right track!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I... Yes! I think you might be right!
</line><line>Judge:
So, Counsel... ...precisely where is <textEffects>the vital clue</textEffects> to this case, which this fourth book conceals?
</line>

<line>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
I would ask the court to observe <textEffects>the back</textEffects> of the book in question.
</line><line>Judge:
The back? What do you- Good gracious! It's been burnt to a crisp!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So we have to ask ourselves, why was the victim clutching what is clearly an unreadable book? It is undeniably...an extremely <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects> thing for her to have been doing.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Unnatural, you say? And what of it, my Nipponese friend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Were I to concede the point, if it bears no relation to the case, there is nothing to discuss. So, should you wish to assert that this fire damage is some veiled <textEffects>clue</textEffects> as to what happened that day... ...pray, do enlighten us all. What <textEffects>truth</textEffects> does this charred book hide?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(A charred book... There is just one possibility here, which I can't quite bring myself to rule out. It's <span style="color:#E16935">an outside chance</textEffects> certainly, but worth a try...)</span> Alright. I'll explain my theory.
</line><line>Judge:
Don't keep us waiting any longer then, Counsel. Explain this theory of yours. <textEffects>What are you suggesting that you can ascertain from the fire damage this sorry tome has suffered?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
My Lord, the burn on the back of this book reveals a startling truth... ...about <textEffects>the book's owner</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Patricia:
But...we already know who the book belongs to! The victim was gripping it in her hand as she fell to the floor, after all. It's obviously hers!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The question of how this book came to be in the victim's hand has yet to be answered. However... ...as to the questions of who the book really belongs to, and where it originated... ...the defence...has very credible answers!
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious! How can you possibly...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Very well. I'll play along with this futile attempt to delay your inevitable demise. But do remember, the members of the jury may well burn you if your little gamble goes awry.
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, the defence's response here is very likely to influence the final outcome of this trial. <textEffects>So tell the court...who do you claim is the owner of this burnt book?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The answer...is that the book belongs to the couple who own the house where the defendant has his lodgings... ...a certain Mr and Mrs Garrideb!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<textEffects>The landlords</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And whether this is some extraordinary coincidence, of some kind of fate at work, I don't know, but... ...of all the people in London, one of the six chosen for jury duty in this courtroom today... ...is none other than Mrs Garrideb herself!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh, oh my goodness...ME?! I, I think you must be mistaken, sir. I'm...I'm... I'm not Mr Garrideb's wife! I'm...his...<textEffects>maid</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Things would be so much easier if you would just drop the pretence. Alright then, how about a simple question for you? Have you ever seen this book in Mr Garrideb's house?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I, I would never presume to know all of the books he keeps, sir!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
This is outlandish behaviour! This woman is the accused's landlady, you say? You implicate this hardworking member of the public... You besmirch her without a shred of evidence. Your actions...are unforgivable.

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This is not mere conjecture. The defence happens to know... ...that on the day in question... ...at almost exactly the same time as the victim was stabbed on the pavement below... ...another '<textEffects>incident</textEffects>' was taking place in the room on the top floor of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house.
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord! What sort of incident, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...<textEffects>A fire</textEffects>, My Lord.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Garrideb:
'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
...'The Lion's Pride'...
</line><line>Judge:
By Jove! The very <textEffects>same title</textEffects> that's the subject of this debate!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh dear me!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
This is risible! All you've told the court is that a book by the same name was involved in a fire. In which case, it would be reasonable to assume that it was burnt to ashes. And entirely unreasonable...to infer that it magically removed itself to the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it would make more sense...if I told you that the cause of the fire was...marital discord. Without going into details, it appears that Mrs Garrideb was considerably enraged. Apparently she continued to attack Mr Garrideb even amid the flames.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh, how awful! I can't even imagine being so horrid to the one you love. ...Can you, Roly?
</line><line>Roly:
Absolutely not, SAH! My Patricia would never raise a finger against me, sah!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Garrideb:
Had all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke! Then the wife started hurling things at me. There was I, back up against the window, <textEffects>under heavy enemy fire</textEffects>! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The man had his back up against the window...and he had <textEffects>burning books thrown at him</textEffects>? Goodness gracious! Are, are you suggesting... ...that the book was thrown through a window and...and landed coincidentally at the scene of the crime?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No. A thorough investigation of the surrounding area was conducted the very evening of the incident. And there is no report of the Garridebs' window pane being broken.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's quite true. We also saw no sign of broken glass when we visited the Garrideb household. But is it not conceivable that <textEffects>the window was open</textEffects> at the time in-
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Not even remotely! Let us not forget the season, and the chilling weather that accompanies it. No Londoner would ever leave a window open in the middle of winter.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... Does the defence postulate this scenario in all seriousness, Counsel? Do you earnestly claim that the book found at the scene was a flaming projectile thrown by Mr Garrideb's wife?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I believe it's a possibility, My Lord.
</line><line>
???:</line><center>That's quite enough!</center>
<line>
Juror No. 4:
Well! I hope that everyone can see you for what you are now, you little foreign trickster! You call yourself a lawyer, but you're just a coward! A mean coward!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Really?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Claiming that our little tiff set the whole neighbourhood alight... Honestly! Implying that I'm merely posing as a maid for appearances' sake... How could you?! It's nothing to do with this beastly case, not any of it! All you've done is sully our family's name!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! I, I assure you, that was never my intention!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Dragging an upstanding citizen's name through the mud simply to divert attention from your failing defence... I should box your ears, that's what I should do! It's utterly unforgivable!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Too right!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Here we go...
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
How long have we sat here now, listening to this Nipponese spouting out his fancy foreign theories? But...think about it! At the end of the day, the only person who could possibly have stabbed the victim... ...is that little hunchback with the moustache! And he ran away from the scene, too!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I, I do declare you're right...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
It's true!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Yes! What did I tell you?!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Makes sense to me!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
...Hm? Sorry? What's that?
</line><line>Judge:
Well... ...it would appear that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are once again in full agreement. What is your position, Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
In truth, My Lord...I feel these have been unnecessarily protracted proceedings. But then one must always exercise patience in order to savour the best vintage.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! Wait! The, the mystery of the fourth book still hasn't been-
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If books are your predilection, my learned friend...study them on your own time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...What, no 'forgive the discourtesy' this time?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem! In that case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now state your individual decisions regarding the defendant's culpability for the court to hear!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Guilty!

<textEffects>(That's twice now. It's over...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Mr Naruhodo, don't give up!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! Miss Susato...?
</line><line>Susato:
Have you forgotten? The battle isn't over yet!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're, you're not suggesting...?
</line><line>Susato:
Of course. The defence has the right to another summation examination at this point. You could still convince the jurors to change their minds. You have one more chance!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...My Lord! The defence...asks to exercise its right to a summation examination!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Hmph. You believe you still have tricks up your sleeve?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't intend to trick anybody. I intend to uncover the truth! <textEffects>(This is no time to be downcast. As long as there's a chance, I have to stay strong and determined!)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Judge:
I have considered the defence counsel's request for a further summation examination of the jury... ...and I have determined that the court must uphold the defence's judicial right to this procedure. So, Counsel...you will now proceed with your second summation examination. I presume the jury is ready, Mr Foreman?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
We are, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
Very good. In that case, I must ask each of you now to state clearly and concisely for the court... ...<textEffects>the grounds</textEffects> on which you find the defendant guilty of this crime.

<line>Juror No. 1:
The accused left behind evidence at the scene, didn't he? Those three books of his.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
If there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Even if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Dearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Look, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Come to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.

<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hm, yes...considerably more tangible arguments from all members of the jury this time around, it seems. ...With one notable exception, of course.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My learned student friend was unable to find fault in the previous witness testimony.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So the court must accept the fact that it was indeed the accused seen fleeing from the scene. And moreover... ...no one else was even at the scene to commit the crime!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, if the eye witnesses are correct...it would seem as if the conclusion is somewhat <textEffects>set in stone</textEffects>. I fail to see how it can be argued any other way.
</line><line>Susato:
...That means, I'm afraid, that during this summation examination... ...it's essential that you establish some other tangible explanation for the facts!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But how? What would even constitute <textEffects>a tangible explanation</textEffects> here?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Isn't it obvious? Who stabbed the woman and how? Those two details are all you need provide. Simply give us <textEffects>a name</textEffects> and <textEffects>a method</textEffects> by which the attack was conducted.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...And there I was thinking this might be hard.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
But Mr Naruhodo, you have to do it! Otherwise this really will be where the trial ends!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh, no pressure then...
</line><line>Judge:
That's quite enough preamble. Proceed with the summation examination, please. I presume you are prepared, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes! ...My Lord. <textEffects>(Alright, Ryunosuke, focus your mind now... Clearly, the key to this summation examination... ...is going to be juror number four, the maid. Or should I say, Mrs Garrideb?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
We have a book that disappeared from the Garridebs' house on the evening of the incident... ...and the fourth book found in the victim's hand.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There must be a way to link the two. Yes, that's what we have to find... <textEffects>(...using every technique I've learnt in my short career so far! Whatever it takes!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Don't forget to keep an eye on Mrs Garrideb and <textEffects>how she reacts</textEffects>...even to the things other people say!

Yes, that's right. So there's definitely a chance that one of the books could have flown past the man and out of the window. Only...

<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
These two statements clearly have a deeply significant connection!
</line><line>Judge:
Good grief! You mean they don't contradict each other? Explain, Counsel! At once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Juror number two...do you think perhaps... ...that this could be one such novel alternative?
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Oh my! Whatever do you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
An alternative explanation...as to how the victim was stabbed in the back.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We've demonstrated that the fourth book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that was found at the scene of the crime... ...originated in Mr Garrideb's room on the top floor of his house. Therefore it's equally possible that some other object besides the book... ...could have <textEffects>found its way</textEffects> from the Garrideb household to the street below.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Eh? What's that now?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
After all, Mrs Garrideb could have thrown any number of different objects at her husband. ...Isn't that right, juror number four?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
What are you insinuating now, you...you little beanpole?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I'm beginning to think that...ever since <span style="color:#E16935">the true origins</textEffects> of this book came to light... ...perhaps she's <textEffects>had a feeling</textEffects> this might be what happened.)</span>
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Now you listen here, you Eastern galah! As the foreman of this jury, I demand a straight answer. You give us this yarn about <textEffects>some other object</textEffects> making its way out of the house...but what? What was it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(I'm really taking a big gamble here. That was a bold <span style="color:#E16935">accusation</textEffects> to make...but I haven't any real evidence to back it up. But I'm certain...that at the very least this warrants <textEffects>further investigation</textEffects>.)</span> Alright, Mr Foreman, I'll try to explain the defence's theory. <textEffects>The 'other object' that found its way from the Garrideb household to the scene of the crime was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
......... Juror number four...Mrs Garrideb...
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Wha...? What now?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I must apologise in advance for this... ...but I need you to confirm something else for the court. This knife... Have you ever seen this knife before?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Ah...
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord, Counsel! What on earth are you doing? That's <textEffects>the weapon</textEffects> that was lodged into the victim's back, man!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My Lord, remember that when the victim was attacked, Mr and Mrs Garrideb were in the throes of an argument. Mrs Garrideb was hurling anything she could at her husband, who'd been backed up against the window. A window that had been opened to clear the smoke...and through which a book sailed to land <textEffects>at the crime scene</textEffects>.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
You can't seriously believe that! The book...was found in the victim's grasp!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Are you saying that it flew out of the window and across the street to land neatly in her hand?
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Huh! Even my missus hasn't got an aim like that!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I admit...there are many details we don't yet understand. But that's the point! That's precisely why... ...we must not allow this trial to end! Not right now!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Oh my!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Agh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mrs Garrideb, your answer, please! Have you seen this knife before or not?

Juror No. 2:
I, I wish to change my decision! ...I'm a woman of my word, after all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you, madam!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Yes, I agree. I certainly didn't see this coming, but... ...I just don't think it would be right for this trial to come to an end now with so many unanswered questions.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Foreman!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
......... I'd have to agree. Not that I think the granny did it, mind.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
...Yes, you know what? I'm not quite happy about this at the moment, either.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
All together now, ladies and gents...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We... We...did it...
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Judge:
So, as a result of the defence's summation examination, a number of jurors' leanings have changed. Two jurors call guilty, against four now calling innocent. Accordingly, the opinion of this court is divided... ...and this trial will continue!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now then, Lord van Zieks...how does the prosecution wish to proceed?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...This trial is rapidly descending into a farce. Like a corked wine...the first few sips are bitter enough... ...but what follows is so repugnant, it's good for nothing save the gutter!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
If, if I may, Lord van Zieks... ...the defence has just put forward a credible alternative explanation for what happened.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Credible? Is that your considered opinion, Mr Foreman? The defence's argument is a joke to which I barely know how to respond. But let me start by insisting... ...that you must familiarise yourselves better with <textEffects>the relative positions</textEffects> of those places being discussed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that? <textEffects>(...What's his angle this time?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It should already be more than apparent, that between the crime scene and the Garrideb household... ...runs a rather wide street, <textEffects>Briar Road</textEffects>. Which means that the distance from the Garridebs' house to the scene is some... Yes, fifteen yards.
</line><line>Susato:
Let me see... Fifteen yards... That's around fourteen metres.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
F-Fourteen metres? <textEffects>(Oh. ...That's a little farther than I'd imagined.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And, as you ladies and gentlemen of the jury rightly noted as having portentous significance... ...the fourth book was found <textEffects>in the victim's clutches</textEffects>. In other words...the smouldering book, wantonly hurled by the lady of the house travelled some fifteen yards... ...to land on the opposite side of the road, neatly between the collapsed victim's fingers and thumb. ...Is that your final conclusion, my learned...and deluded friend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Um...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And did the jackknife follow a near identical trajectory to plunge into the middle of the victim's back? This fantasy is somewhat stretching the notion of 'having a bad day' for the victim, I think. Even those pathetic serialised detective stories have more believable plots!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... <textEffects>(There's nothing I can say to that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
That...that prosecutor loves the sound of his own voice!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato!
</line><line>Susato:
Serialised detective stories are pathetic, are they?! How dare he?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um... Maybe let's pick our battles here...
</line><line>Susato:
My Lord, might I be allowed to speak?
</line><line>Judge:
As judicial assistant, you may speak for the defence, yes. Go ahead.
</line><line>Susato:
The prosecution may consider the idea a fantasy... ...but what the defence has postulated was believable enough to persuade the jury to change its leaning. And as such...the court has a duty to explore this alternative explanation as thoroughly as possible!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
To that end... ......... ...juror number four - Mrs Joan Garrideb...must be called to testify and submit to cross-examination!
</line><line>Judge:
Saints alive! A cross-examination of a juror?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well...this, this is highly irregular. It is unprecedented for a member of the jury to be summoned to the witness stand.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
There are already witnesses in the stand whose testimony the defence may further cross-examine. If my learned friend's farcical theory has any truth in it... ...then both a burning book and a jackknife must have flown through the sky before this couple's eyes. And we must assume they would be able to testify accordingly.

<line>Judge:
Well, this is quite startling. <textEffects>Top-hinged casement windows</textEffects>!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
That detail was not in the police report, Constable.
</line><line>Roly:
Ah, yes, um... Sorry about that. I...must have been a little drowsy... Ahem.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You cannot excuse your sins with drowsiness every time, Constable.
</line><line>Roly:
No, SAH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...sorry, but... ...what exactly is <textEffects>a top-hinged casement window</textEffects>?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And you... You cannot excuse your ignorance with such trite remarks, my learned friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Of course...sorry.
</line><line>Susato:
I've found it, Mr Naruhodo! Cast your mind back to the windows in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's room...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Alright, I'll try...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
So the window opens in order to allow air to circulate inside the house. But as it's <textEffects>a top-hinged casement window</textEffects>, it swings open along the upper edge, you see.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I'm glad you've rectified your ignorance. A casement window's most prominent feature... ...is its '<textEffects>stay</textEffects>' - a metal bar which prevents the window from being opened beyond a certain amount.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It, it <textEffects>prevents it opening</textEffects>? <textEffects>(This is all news to me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Roly:
Absolutely correct, sah! In other words, if a book or knife were to have been thrown through the open window... ...it would have clattered against the pane and fallen straight down to the pavement below.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You see the problem, then? Good...your education in windows is complete. There was never any possibility of either the book or the knife travelling fifteen yards over the road. That is, unless the window pane had been shattered... something we've discounted already.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Th-That can't... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
</line><line>Patricia:
Did you see that, Roly? That young Japanese man just collapsed in agony!
</line><line>Roly:
Oh yes, my darling. I saw it. I saw how he crumbled before me.

</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes, <textEffects>on the opposite side</textEffects> of Briar Road to where the victim was attacked. But considering the size of that meagre 'bouquet' - if a single, sorry bloom can be so described... ...no doubt it was blown in the wind across the street, back into the gutter where it belongs.
</line><line>Patricia:
Meagre...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a> 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But if that were the case... ...why did Constable Beate not testify to the fact?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
'No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it.' Constable Beate swore to that on Scotland Yard's honour.
</line><line>Patricia:
But the bouquet belonged to me! It has nothing to do with the case. That's...that's why Roly didn't mention it, I'm sure!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, because sadly it's not only your bouquet we're talking about here. More than one thing in this case is mysteriously <textEffects>the wrong way round</textEffects>!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Think about it... Besides Mrs Beate's bouquet...there's Mr Garrideb's book! Mr Garrideb's copy of 'The Lion's Pride', which was thrown out of the window by his wife... ...would have struck the pane of the casement window and landed here, <textEffects>on the west side</textEffects> of the street. And yet... ...it was actually found here, <textEffects>on the opposite side</textEffects> of the road, in the victim's hand. Meanwhile, according to the testimony we've heard, Mrs Beate's bouquet... ...should have been dropped here, at the scene of the crime, <textEffects>on the east end</textEffects> of the street. But in fact... ...it was actually found here, <textEffects>on the opposite side</textEffects> of the road, in front of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house. There's no logical explanation for those things... ...unless somebody <textEffects>deliberately moved them</textEffects>!
</line><line>Patricia:
What are you trying to say? The way you're talking, it sounds like you think my Roly's done something wrong!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Don't you listen to a word that scrawny lawyer says! Wittering on about books and bouquets... Why should we care? It's nitpicking, that's what it is!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Oh good. Mrs Garrideb's come round.)</textEffects> You might call it nitpicking, Mrs Garrideb... ...but deliberately meddling with the scene of a crime is a criminal offence. It's called, um...
</line><line>Susato:
...'<textEffects>Tampering</textEffects>', Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But the person responsible for this tampering cannot admit to it... ...for a very subtle, but compelling reason.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
'Tampering'? You've barely heard the term before! Tell us, my learned friend, who would possibly have had cause to carry out such an elaborate deception?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, there is someone who <span style="color:#E16935">tampered with the scene</textEffects> of the crime that evening. All the evidence and all the testimony points to that <textEffects>one particular person</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, I must demand that you substantiate this conjecture. <textEffects>Who are you saying is responsible for tampering with the scene of the crime?</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Obviously, there's only one person it could have been. Constable Roly Beate, it was you!
</line><line>Judge:
What?! A policeman?! A member of Scotland Yard?
</line><line>Patricia:
What nonsense! Why would my Roly do something like that? There's no one straighter than my husband! No bobby works more tirelessly for the people of London!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mrs Beate... ...you said in your testimony that your husband asked you to go to a nearby police box to fetch the officer on duty. The fifteen minutes that you were absent from the scene is the only opportunity anyone had to tamper with it.
</line><line>Patricia:
You're making it up! It's all nonsense! It's all lies! What about that Japanese man with the whiskers? I bet it was him! He did it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If that was true, Constable Beate would have seen him do it!
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh...
</line><line>Susato:
And forgive me for pointing it out, but when you dropped your bouquet, Mrs Beate... ...it was <textEffects>after</textEffects> the defendant had fled the scene.
</line><line>Patricia:
Argh! Well...well...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a> 
</line><line>Van Zieks:
First you make accusations about the landlord and his wife...and now you incriminate a policeman as well. But your accusations lack one very important thing.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You claim the crime scene was <textEffects>tampered with</textEffects>. But there is only one reason anyone would commit such a reckless crime: <textEffects>To hide something</textEffects>.
</line><line>Patricia:
That's right! He's right! But my husband and I just happened to be there, that's all! So why would we have anything to hide? It doesn't make sense!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You've offered no <textEffects>motive</textEffects> for this alleged tampering. And until you do...your accusations are nothing but empty threats!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(Constable Beate had a very good reason for wanting to tamper with the scene of the crime. That's <span style="color:#E16935">the key</textEffects> to this entire affair.)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, have you...? Have you managed to solve this mystery?
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, you have made a very serious accusation against a London police officer. If you are mistaken, I'm sure I need not point out that your reputation as a lawyer will be irrevocably damaged. ...With that stark warning in mind, you will now explain to the court the motive for this alleged tampering.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. ......... <textEffects>Constable Beate's motive for tampering with the crime scene was to hide...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
...Where the victim fell to the ground! That is what this bobby had to cover up at all costs!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?!
</line><line>Patricia:
Where the victim fell? You, you mean <textEffects>where she was attacked</textEffects>? What are you talking about? We told you at the very start, didn't we?! On the pavement of Briar Road! We saw it happen, remember? It was right here...as if anyone didn't already know!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That's certainly what everybody has been led to believe. But in fact...that isn't where the victim was stabbed at all.
</line><line>Patricia:
Wha...? WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Judge:
I'm beginning to wonder where this tumultuous trial will end, Counsel.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If that's your assertion...then the court is dying to know, my Nipponese friend... <textEffects>...where are you proposing that the crime actually took place that evening?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
But, but that's...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
On <textEffects>the opposite side of the road</textEffects>?
</line><line>Patricia:
I, I don't understand...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
On the evening in question... ...Mr Garrideb's book fell directly down from the open window above. And your bouquet, Mrs Beate, never moved at all. What did move...was <textEffects>the scene of the crime</textEffects> itself!
</line><line>Judge:
Good... GOOD GRACIOUS!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Perhaps you haven't been listening to the ample testimony the court has heard. But these witnesses both saw the moment the attack took place!
</line><line>Patricia:
That's, that's right! I saw it! With my own eyes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was five o'clock in the evening and already dark. There was the typical London fog on the ground. When you saw the incident unfold and ran to the victim's aid... ...that was actually on <textEffects>the west side</textEffects> of Briar Road.
</line><line>Patricia:
No! That's not true! It, it can't have been!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Constable Beate then arranged for you to be absent for a while by sending you for help. And during the fifteen minutes you were away, he <textEffects>transplanted</textEffects> the crime scene. He moved all the things shown in this print: the victim herself...the four books... He moved everything in fact...to the pavement on <textEffects>the east side</textEffects> of Briar Road!
</line><line>Judge:
Extraordinary...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But the constable <textEffects>overlooked</textEffects> one thing.
</line><line>Patricia:
What? What did he overlook?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The bouquet, I presume?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly.
</line><line>Susato:
The prosecution told the court just a few minutes ago about the discovery of the rose bouquet. Lord van Zieks said, 'It wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light.'
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, it couldn't be seen in the dark, obviously.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which is why it was only the bouquet... ...that was found in its original position, on the pavement <textEffects>on the west side</textEffects> of Briar Road.
</line><line>Patricia:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that...is the defence's theory about what really happened that evening. How do you respond... ...Constable Roly Beate?
</line><line>Roly:
......... Um...well...I'm... Very sorry. I didn't mean to nod off again. But I haven't slept properly...in a month. Did I miss...anything...important...?
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh Roly... ...it isn't true, is it? What that lawyer said is all lies, isn't it? I know it is, because you're the most upstanding, righteous man I know!
</line><line>Roly:
......... I had...a dream... A terrible dream... All the thingzzz...I did that night... Everything...come out... Everything...expozzz'd...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Roly:
Only...it seemzzz... ...it...wasn't a dream at all.
</line><line>Judge:
Good... GOOD GOLLY! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What on earth is the meaning of all this?
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh Roly, why? Why would you do something like this? Moving a corpse is...is...is a criminal offence, isn't it?
</line><line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Wishing the victim dead should be one, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Constable, explain yourself! Why would you do this? As a respected member of Scotland Yard, your duty is to protect the good people of London town!
</line><line>Roly:
......... I, I can't say...sah.
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAT?!
</line><line>Roly:
I really am ever so sorry about all this. For damaging the Yard's reputation... For...for everything...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I have a possible explanation.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
For why, on that particular evening... ...Constable Beate felt compelled to move the scene of the crime. I can think of one reason.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?! How could you possibly know? You - a foreigner - presuming to understand the mind of a Scotland Yard policeman!
</line><line>Judge:
And yet, Lord van Zieks, it is this foreigner who has uncovered the startling truth of the matter thus far.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
I believe it would be beneficial to the court to hear this extraordinary young lawyer's theory. Counsel for the Defence, if you please...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
Now then...I think you had better show us some evidence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At once, My Lord. <textEffects>(England... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, human emotions are the same. And I think I have a fairly good idea of <span style="color:#E16935">the feelings</textEffects> behind this man's actions...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>What gives away the motive for Constable Beate's unthinkable actions?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
......... I realise that I'm a foreigner in this land. And I have only just arrived from Japan. Which is why all this information about London's so-called 'bobbies' is completely new to me. I've learnt that, though honourable, 'patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world', for example.
</line><line>Judge:
Keeping the peace, looking after the citizens on his beat in all kinds of ways... There's no doubt that the young bobby is charged with a great deal to do each day, certainly.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But for Constable Beate, the day in question was <textEffects>special</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Special? How?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
On account of this <textEffects>bouquet</textEffects>, My Lord.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh yes! It was our very first wedding anniversary!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Constable Beate had worked so hard to be able to afford this simple gift for his wife... ...and was so looking forward to taking her out for a celebratory meal...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...When he and Mrs Beate stumbled upon a crime along Briar Road. When he saw that shadowy figure through the fog collapse on the pavement ahead of them... ...what must have gone through the man's mind?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Roly:
But SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This is the warrant card that Constable Beate offered to lend to me earlier. Inside, among the rules for patrolling policemen, it says... ...'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'
</line><line>Judge:
Ah ha!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Constable Beate... ...is that or is that not the reason why you moved the whole scene of the crime that day?
</line><line>Roly:
......... Yes... Everything you said... It's all right...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... So that's it... It was all to do with <textEffects>the boundary of your beat</textEffects>.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly. To summarise... ...the incident actually occurred on Constable Beate's beat.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious! Constable! Do you realise the gravity of what you have done?
</line><line>Roly:
......... It...was the first time since I became a copper... ...that I'd ever cursed God. 'Stay close to me, Pat! The criminal could still be lurking somewhere!'
</line>
<center>As we ran over to the scene, I had every intention of doing my duty as a police officer.</center>
<line>'We've got to report this to the station as quickly as possible!'
</line>
<center>...But then it dawned on me. I realised where we were. <textEffects>Where the victim was</textEffects> lying. And what that meant for me.</center>
<line>'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'
</line>
<center>Why here? Why did this have to happen here? And why tonight of all nights?! ...Why...?</center>
<line>It's a copper's job to guard the scene of the crime, so... ...I told Pat she'd have to go to the nearest police box and fetch whoever was on duty there. It was then, when I opened my mouth to speak... It just...came out. I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of my own mouth! 'This is the next beat to mine, Pat. So you'll have to go <i>[sic]</i> the police box that covers it. Turn right along Meerschaum Street, and then... ............ ........ ......' ......... .........I'm...I'm... I'm sorry... I'm...so sorry...
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Constable...
</line><line>Roly:
I...I just wanted... Just that one night... To take my Patricia out for dinner.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh Roly...
</line><line>Roly:
Just that one night. .........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You knew that if the incident was on your beat, your evening of celebration would be ruined. And so you decided...to move the entire crime scene outside your jurisdiction. Just across the street, to the east pavement of Briar Road... which falls under the neighbouring beat's care.
</line><line>Roly:
......... You see, I... I thought ...Well, I was sure the victim was dead, you see.
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh, of course he did! Otherwise my Roly would never have left the poor woman on the freezing cold pavement!
</line><line>Judge:
......... Ah, I see your meaning now.
</line><line>Roly:
......... But God got me back for my sins, didn't He? That's why... That's why I missed the rose I bought for Pat.
</line><line>Patricia:
Oh no, Roly! That was all my fault! I should never have dropped it in such a dark place... I'm so sorry, Roly!
</line><line>Roly:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... And can you tell us, Constable... ...how many books did you move from the one side of the road to the other in total?
</line><line>Roly:
Hm? Oh! ...Um... Four, it was. Yes, sah. ...Definitely...four.
</line><line>Susato:
Three of them dropped by Mr Natsume, and the fourth... ...being the one that fell from the window upstairs in the Garrideb household, of course.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand? When all the others were scattered haphazardly around, I mean.
</line><line>Roly:
Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
'How you found it'? What do you mean?
</line><line>Roly:
When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're sure it was this book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that the victim was holding?
</line><line>Roly:
Oh yes, sah. No doubt about it...sah...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Hm...interesting...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>The fourth book's information has been updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Roly:
......... I thought it was an open-and-shut case at the time, you see. There were only the two people at the scene. And Pat and me both saw it happen. However which way you looked at it, it had to be the fellow who ran off who'd done it...I thought. I couldn't see the harm, really. I didn't think moving it all over the road would make a jot of difference. I... I suppose this is it for me now. I've had it...
</line>
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Van Zieks:
My Lord...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I believe...that concludes the cross-examination of the witnesses.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Constable...you may withdraw.
</line><line>Roly:
Yes, SAH!
</line><line>Patricia:
Um, Mr Prosecutor, sir... ...what will become of my Roly? What will happen to him?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... For now, you are free to go home. The police will contact you in due course.
</line><line>Patricia:
Please...don't punish my husband! This, this was all my fault! It's because I'm always moaning at him for coming home late!
</line><line>Roly:
Leave it now, Pat. ...Let's go home. I'm...tired...
</line><line>Patricia:
...Alright then, my love.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
One last thing, Constable...
</line><line>Roly:
Sah?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let this be a lesson to you. In a criminal investigation, every detail matters, however insignificant it may seem to you.
</line><line>Roly:
Yes...sah...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Carve that lesson in your mind. And never again make the mistake of tampering with the scene of a crime.
</line><line>Roly:
Ah?! N-Never again, sah? You, you mean to say...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Leave. Now. This trial is not yet over.
</line><line>Roly:
Uh...um... SAAAH!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, quite a startling revelation, I must say. Whoever thought of a third party transplanting the entire scene of a crime like that!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Indeed, My Lord. Nevertheless, there are some immutable facts here. Principally... ...that the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume, is the only person who could possibly have committed this crime.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! I disagree. Now that we know the true scene of the incident...there is someone else. Another person who <textEffects>could be responsible</textEffects> for the knife in the victim's back!
</line><line>Susato:
Forgive me for being presumptuous... ...but I believe the prosecution is probably well aware of this possibility already.
</line><line>Judge:
Lord van Zieks! Is this true?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Very well. Name the person if you will. And if further investigation is warranted... ...the prosecution has no objection to the trial continuing.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>You will name this 'other person' who could have perpetrated the crime!</textEffects>

<line>Ryunosuke:
The defence would once again like to request the cross-examination of a new witness, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
Once again?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My assistant made the same request earlier. In order to finally reveal the truth about this case... ...it's imperative that we cross-examine juror number four...Mrs Joan Garrideb!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Me? Me?! Oh dearie me!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
That request has already been denied!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But the situation is very different now! Mrs Garrideb, answer me this...
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
What do you want now, you little toad?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At the time of the incident, you were engaged in a violent argument with your husband, Mr John Garrideb. In the course of the argument, a minor house fire was ignited... ...and to clear the smoke from the room, your husband opened a window that looks out over Briar Road.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Well, what of it?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You threw this book at your husband, when he was cornered with his back against the window. Upon striking the pane of the open top-hinged casement window, the book plummeted directly down... ...finding its way... ...to what we now know to be the true scene of the incident.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Yes, and as I said, what of it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
During the argument, you were beside yourself with rage. As such, you threw not just books, but anything you could lay your hands on.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So...let me ask you one more time, Mrs Garrideb... This knife - the one removed from the victim's back... Have you really never laid eyes on it before?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Ah... ......... ............ ...I don't recall it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Seriously...?
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Am I supposed to remember everything I picked up and threw at my husband? And anyway, the man over there in all that regalia said members of the jury needn't testify, didn't he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Conveniently, yes.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
No! I have no recollection of saying that at all...juror number four.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Make no mistake... You jurors are not special in any way. You are not immune to the judicial process. If you know something about this knife, madam...let the truth come out.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
But! But that's just a common-or-garden knife! It could have come from anywhere. We have several like that at home. If, if one went missing... ...how would you expect me to know?!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
What's that?
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Are you joking?
</line><line>Judge:
What are you saying, please, Mrs Garrideb?
</line><line>Now you listen to me!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I, I refuse to believe all this nonsense! I couldn't bear the thought that I'd injured someone. Do you hear? I couldn't bear it!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, the poor woman...
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
So...yes! I want <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>! I want to see hard evidence if you're going to insist on this being my fault! You're going to have to prove to me that I threw that knife if that's what you think. Come along now! Chop chop! ...Do your worst!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, well...
</line><line>Susato:
Well, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If, if I had evidence like that, believe me, I would have thrown it at her already!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Then take the stand, juror!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution does not object to the defence's request to cross-examine this woman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Lord van Zieks.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I... I'm going to have to testify?
</line><line>Judge:
Juror number four... ...as I'm sure you will appreciate, having observed it with your own eyes today... ...witness testimony can lead to the most extraordinary truths being unearthed. Truths of which the witnesses themselves may not even have been aware.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Oh dearie me...
</line><line>Judge:
So I demand your full and unadulterated testimony, Mrs Garrideb. And mark my words: In this court of law today...we shall extract the truth! Do you concur, Counsels?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Certainly, My Lord.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um... ...That's what I'm hoping for, My Lord! <textEffects>(This is such a strange feeling... For the first time since arriving in this country, it actually feels real. I'm here, in the Old Bailey...and I'm <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</textEffects>!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
Witness, state your name and occupation.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh...ah... Yes, my name is Joan Garrideb... ...and I'm...um...well... I'm a juror...and suchlike.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It sounds like even she doesn't know if she's a housewife or a maid or what any more...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The court has decided your testimony is required in order to clarify matters in this case. ...Do you understand, madam?
</line><line>Joan:
...Yes! ...My Lord!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You will tell the court everything that took place in your household on the evening in question. And I warn you... Do not attempt to hide the truth.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh... Oh dearie me...
</line><line>???:
...Chin up, Joanie. Nothing to worry about now.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh! I didn't know you were here, John!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Garrideb:
Wasn't only you in the room that day, old thing, was it? Rather think I ought to testify as well, don't you?
</line><line>Joan:
But...but what about your knee, dear?
</line><line>Garrideb:
Don't you worry about that. Hardly notice it! I'm not the sort of chap to leave a comrade to face disciplinary action alone.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh, John...
</line><line>Judge:
I presume you are Mr John Garrideb?
</line><line>Garrideb:
Yes, sir! Former second lieutenant of the third regiment of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir! Seen my fair share of action and now living the quiet life, as it were.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...The quiet life? Were you not engaged in an incendiary battle with your spouse on the day in question?
</line><line>Garrideb:
Ah...well...yes... Ahem! Quite.
</line><line>Judge:
I believe this may represent a first in the proud history of the British court. Calling a juror to the witness stand is unprecedented. However, the court will hear your testimony now, juror number four, and that of your husband. You will recount clearly and concisely the events in your home at the time of the incident in question.
</line><line>Garrideb:
Sir! At once!

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Battle of Garrideb -</textEffects></center>
<line>Garrideb:
Yes, on the day you're referring to, the wife and I did have a bit of a skirmish. Can't recall the reason now.
Knocked a candlestick over and set fire to the carpet! Soon had it out, though, and got the window open.
</line><line>Joan:
Meanwhile...I was picking up whatever I could find to throw at him.
</line><line>Garrideb:
Plenty of knives around our place. Can't say I'd notice if one or two went missing, I'm afraid.
If that bally thing in the victim's back really was one of ours, you'll have a job proving it, I think.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmmm... It sounds as though it was <textEffects>quite the battlefield</textEffects> in your household that evening.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Although an entirely <textEffects>one-sided</textEffects> assault, it seems.
</line><line>Garrideb:
The enemy caught us on the hop, sir. Had no choice but to dig in and take defensive measures. To be honest, if the enemy had kept shelling us for another minute, we'd have been toast. 'Course, a veteran such as myself... ...is only too aware that on every battlefield, you're just a gnat's whisker from death at any moment.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Are we still talking about a marital quarrel here?
</line><line>Judge:
Well... ...I must say I'm dubious that this testimony will shed any light on the origins of this jackknife.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
In combat, one's focus narrows such that surroundings are barely noticed. These witnesses may not be able to offer anything more than they have testified already. This may be a dead end.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Van Zieks may well be right.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Well, whatever the chances... ...we only have this last cross-examination to uncover <textEffects>the truth</textEffects>, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...I'm afraid so.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Counsel. Begin your cross-examination!

<line>Joan:
It was really only soft items I was throwing. And I was really most restrained. The majority of them barely hit John. ...He is my husband, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
I see, Mrs Garrideb. Your thoughtfulness and consideration for your spouse is...apparent.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What about you, Mr Garrideb? Do you remember what your wife threw at you?
</line><line>Garrideb:
Well, I recall 'The Lion's Pride', of course. Jolly good book. Only just purchased it, too.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...And a jolly good book for burning, it seems.
</line><line>Garrideb:
But it was a dashed awful scene on the battlefield, I can tell you. Flames everywhere...smoke billowing... Couldn't see a bally thing, really. I dare say I wouldn't even have noticed a knife bouncing off the old bonce.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I don't think they tend to bounce, actually.

</line><line>Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...I think we've heard all this before, to be honest. I can't say I'm particularly confident that we'll be able to prove anything new from this testimony.
</line><line>Susato:
But...in this cross-examination it's absolutely essential... ...that we establish how this knife came to be at the scene of the incident.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...I know...
</line><line>Susato:
......... I'm sure both of them must be feeling very worried. Worried that it was in fact a knife belonging to one of them that caused the victim's injury.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If we could find even a tiny shred of evidence to support that theory... ...it would clinch this trial for us. It would explain everything.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes...it would.

<textEffects>(So, for Soseki-san's sake, we must. We must find that last crucial piece of evidence!)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb. Could I ask you to take a good look at this, please?
</line><line>Garrideb:
......... You can ask, but I can't see a bally thing.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You can't?
</line><line>Garrideb:
Used to call me 'Deadeye 'Deb' back in the regiment of course. ...But that was some time ago now. Even when I'm trying to enjoy a large-print book by the fire these days... ...I struggle to tell a '<textEffects>b</textEffects>' from a '<textEffects>d</textEffects>' and a '<textEffects>p</textEffects>' from a '<textEffects>q</textEffects>', to be honest.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh, he does. Dearie me, it's rather wearing being asked about every other letter in every other word.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...You must 'de' very 'dusy'.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What is that? A tiny scrap of metal?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Almost certainly from the tip of a blade. And what may appear at first to be just a tiny scrap...is in fact a crucial piece of evidence!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Interesting. And where did the defence come by this evidence?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was lodged in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe.
</line><line>Garrideb:
My pipe, you say? By Jove, I wonder how that got there.
</line><line>Judge:
And what precisely does this fragment of metal signify, Counsel? Are you suggesting that it is in some way related to the matter of the stabbing on Briar Road?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I am!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
When put together with another piece of evidence already in the Court Record... ...I believe this tiny fragment of metal will unravel the whole truth of this case, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, you appear rather confident in that extraordinary statement, Counsel. Very well then, present the pertinent evidence to the court! <textEffects>What evidence, when paired with this fragment of metal, allegedly reveals the truth of this entire case?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
This is the knife that was found in the victim's back. If you look closely, you will see that there is a small piece at the tip of the blade that is missing.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A common issue with the inferior blades sold at unsavoury street markets. Criminals who use them regularly leave the tips lodged in their victims' bones.
</line><line>Judge:
And what of this particular knife?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No doubt its tip has suffered a similar fate, now languishing somewhere near the spine of the victim.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! That's not the case.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The tip of this particular knife's blade... ...is the very fragment of metal we discovered in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe!
</line><line>Garrideb:
Ah!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Argh...!
</line><line>Judge:
Good grief! Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I, I don't believe it! The knife from the crime scene and this <textEffects>fragment of metal</textEffects>... ...are <textEffects>a perfect match</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Good... GOOD GOLLY GOSH!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is, is this...some sort of Eastern sorcery?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... This is no magic, My Lord. This...is a miracle.
</line><line>Judge:
A miracle?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So van Zieks has figured it out, has he?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel! Explain this extraordinary coincidence at once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! The crucial point we have to ask ourselves here... ...is <textEffects>when</textEffects> did the fragment of metal find its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe?
</line><line>Susato:
Something that was clarified for us in the most recent witness testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Garrideb:
Had this thing in my hand as usual at the time of the onslaught. Knocked it clean out with one of her 'soft' projectiles, she did! Yes... It would never have been sent flying unless it was hit by something pretty solid.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Garrideb:
Oh...dearie...me...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
During the argument between these two that occurred just as the victim was on the pavement below... ...Mrs Garrideb flung this knife at her husband. However... ...the knife missed Mr Garrideb, instead striking the pipe in his hand at the time.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Which caused the tip to <textEffects>break off</textEffects>... Of course.
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. And that is when the tiny tip of the blade... ...found its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe!
</line><line>Garrideb:
The...the chances of that are a million to one!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And yet there's no other credible explanation for how the tip of the blade ended up in your pipe. Then, after losing its tip, the knife ricocheted off the pipe and flew out of <textEffects>the open window</textEffects>.
</line><line>Garrideb:
Ah...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In short! This knife, which <textEffects>fell</textEffects> from the window of the Garridebs' house... ...is the very same knife that struck the victim in the middle of the back on the street below!
</line><line>Joan:
Oh gosh! Oh dear! Oh... ...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
...A full-bodied theory, I'll give you that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A complex bouquet of seemingly trivial points, plausibly arranged to create an almost passable vintage. Allow me to toast my learned friend's characteristically Nipponese approach to <textEffects>bottling his argument</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But after all, it is just a theory. The bottle, I fear, is corked. Because you see... ...it's spoilt by an insurmountable inconsistency!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
An insurmountable... ...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Lord van Zieks! Explain yourself! What is this inconsistency you claim to have identified?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
An inconsistency of the simplest nature, My Lord. The victim was found with the knife planted <textEffects>in the middle of her back</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes, in her- Ah!
</line><line>Joan:
That's right! You silly little man!
</line><line>Garrideb:
Now, Joan old thing... What are you getting so excited about?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let us consider the basic facts of the case once more. The victim was walking along the pavement before being stabbed in the back and falling to the ground. If the knife that struck her had fallen <textEffects>from above</textEffects>... ...there's no possible way it could have planted itself into <textEffects>the victim's back</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
</line><line>Joan:
Quite right! You see! That's exactly right! If the knife had fallen on her from above... ...it would have struck her <textEffects>on the top of her head</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...um... .........
</line>
<center>He's lost for words, look...
I knew it... I never liked his theory in the first place.I don't know, though... What really did happen?</center>
<line>
Judge:
Hmmm... It would appear the defence has made rather a spectacular blunder.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If a theory has even one inconsistency...it cannot stand. Your theory, my learned friend...is history!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(We were so close... I could see the truth... I was so sure we were on the right track... But now the way has been blocked completely...by just one, simple <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>Or in other words...</center>
<line>
Susato:
...we simply need to eliminate that one inconsistency, and the theory will stand!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Miss Susato!
</line><line>Susato:
You mustn't worry, Mr Naruhodo. You were just caught off guard, that's all. And your mind went blank. But if the path you were on is indeed correct, then a way will present itself. The key to this is in the Court Record, I'm sure. All <textEffects>the information</textEffects> you need is there!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It seems you have nothing to say, my Nipponese friend. Well, your silence speaks volumes. A tacit acceptance that your theory...is fatally flawed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This inconsistency doesn't mean I was on the wrong track... It means that I need to sharpen my mind and dig deeper for the truth! It's <span style="color:#E16935">a test</textEffects>!)</span> Yes! If the knife fell on the victim from above, there's no way that it could have hit her in the middle of her back... ...under normal circumstances, that is.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What are you implying?
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can explain this inconsistency. That can explain how the knife that fell from above could have pierced <textEffects>the victim's back</textEffects>. We already have the answer.
</line><line>Judge:
Goodness!
</line><line>Garrideb:
Utter...utter madness!
</line><line>Judge:
Surely this must be the last time... Counsel, present the evidence of which you speak!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is the last inconsistency... The final piece in the puzzle. If I can successfully make sense of this...the truth will be laid bare at last!)</textEffects> <textEffects>The evidence that explains how the falling knife became lodged in the victim's back is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
This - <textEffects>the fourth book</textEffects> found at the scene... This is the final piece of evidence the defence will present!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The burnt book?
</line><line>Judge:
Is that not Mr Garrideb's book?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. And to understand its significance, we have to consider <textEffects>how it came to be</textEffects> at the scene in the first place. This photographic print clearly shows the book in question... ...and the victim <textEffects>holding it</textEffects> in her hand.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But as we all now know... ...it was the police constable that <textEffects>put the book between her fingers</textEffects> like that.
</line><line>Judge:
Quite so. As part of his wholesale transplanting of the crime scene to the opposite side of the road.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's true. However... ...as part of his testimony, Constable Beate made an extremely enlightening statement on that point.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand?
</line><line>Roly:
Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it. When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
In other words, the victim had <textEffects>already picked the book up</textEffects> of her own volition. And clearly, that must have been <textEffects>before</textEffects> she suffered the knife wound.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I should say so! After being attacked with a knife, I don't imagine she'd have been doing much of anything.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So the question becomes...why did the victim have that book in her hand?
</line><line>Garrideb:
By...by jingo! I...think I'm beginning to see what may have happened now.
</line><line>Joan:
Oh dearie me...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... We know that the book fell from the top floor of the Garrideb household onto the pavement below. At precisely the moment that the victim was walking past.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, at exactly that moment. The young woman was walking along the street in the light fog... ...when all of a sudden, a book fell right in front of her.
</line><line>Joan:
...The book I threw...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mrs Garrideb. And what do you think the woman did? What would you do, if you were walking along and suddenly a book landed in front of you on the pavement?
</line><line>Joan:Well, I... I really can't imagine it... But...I suppose... ...she might have reached down...
</line>
<center>...and picked the book up.</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That is exactly what the woman in fact did. She <textEffects>picked up the book</textEffects>!
</line><line>Joan:
Oh... Oh heavens! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And when the woman reached down to <textEffects>pick the fallen book up</textEffects>... ...what position would <textEffects>her back</textEffects> have been in? That's right. Facing the sky, completely and utterly defenceless. Then, in the very next moment, while the woman was still bent over picking up the book... ...the next object fell from the room above - the jackknife - straight into the middle of her back. And at that same time... ...walking by chance directly behind Miss Green... ...was the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume.
</line><line>Judge:
Well I never!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It appeared to Mr Natsume... ...that the woman simply collapsed on the floor. In the dark and the fog, <textEffects>he didn't see</textEffects> the knife falling on her from above.
</line><line>Joan:
Ah!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...And from the other direction... ...the constable and his wife saw no one but the victim and her apparent attacker.
</line><line>Judge:
So <textEffects>there never was</textEffects> a 'real culprit' to run from the scene in the first place...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No. This was nothing more than a series of unlikely events that culminated in an unfortunate accident. And THAT is the real truth behind this case! Well...Mr and Mrs Garrideb?
</line>
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Joan:
The very first time you showed me that knife, I... I had my suspicions. I wondered if perhaps it might have been something like that.
</line><line>Garrideb:
There there, old bean...
</line><line>Susato:
Poor Mrs Garrideb... 
</line><line>Joan:
...Of course I never meant for anything of the sort to happen, but... ...it was all my fault...wasn't it?
</line><line>Garrideb:
.........
</line><line>Joan:
I take full responsibility. I let my anger get the better of me. ...I threw that book. ...And I threw the knife as well.
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Joan:
John, dear...
</line><line>Garrideb:
It's alright. I know.
</line><line>Joan:I'm... I'm ever so sorry. Truly.........
</line>
<center>I'M SORRIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Lord van Zieks...what news of Mrs Garrideb?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
She's been taken to the infirmary. It would appear that today's events had left her in an especially flustered state. However, I believe she will recover in due course. There is no cause for concern.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, unbeknownst to themselves, they caused what could easily have been a terrible tragedy. They shall have to prepare themselves for the consequences of their actions.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
There is some good news, however, My Lord. I have just had word from the hospital where the victim is being treated. Her condition is improving steadily, and the doctor believes she will regain consciousness soon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's strange, we've been talking about the victim all this time, but we've never once met her.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
How wonderful! The woman is out of danger, it seems.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, that is good news.
</line><line>Judge:
So, Mr Soseki Natsume...
</line><line>Soseki:
Ah...um... Yes!
</line><line>Judge:
On behalf of my fellow countrymen, I would like to take this opportunity to beg your pardon, sir. You came from your distant Eastern homeland to study our great British culture... ...and have been repaid with immeasurable unkindness. Please accept our heartfelt apologies.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Soseki:
......... No, it is me who should be begging your pardon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no, Mr Natsume...
</line><line>Soseki:
That evening...when the young woman just collapsed on the pavement before my eyes... ...I, I jumped to the wrong conclusion again, in my confusion.
</line><line>Judge:
What conclusion, sir?
</line><line>Soseki:
I was sure that the woman was dead.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, Constable Beate said the same thing, didn't he? He thought she had been killed, too.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I suppose she must have looked completely lifeless.
</line><line>Soseki:
......... It's been about a year since I arrived in Great Britain now. But I still can't get used to life here. I, I can't relax. I'm sure there are evil spirits lurking in the fog... Like they're haunting me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Poor Soseki-san... His imagination really has got the better of him.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, poor man...
</line><line>Soseki:
So when it happened... ...I thought the young woman had been taken by the fog spirits! I should never have dropped my books like that and run away. I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR HELP! FOR A DOCTOR! FOR THE POLICE! ......... Instead, I've managed to create a rift in the relationship of trust between our two empires. And for that...I am truly sorry.
</line>
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Judge:
One could indeed say that some sort of mischievous spirit has been at work here, I think. One that created a chain of unfortunate mishaps. We were befooled by this spirit and led to false conclusions. But thanks to Lord van Zieks, and our young lawyer here from the East... ...that chain has now been broken, and the spirit exorcised. ...I heartily commend you both.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Yes, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
In concluding this trial, I must ask one last time for your decisions regarding the defendant's culpability. Are you ready to present your findings to the court?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
As the foreman of the jury, I can assure you we've reached a fair and just conclusion.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I do declare the truth can be extremely cruel at times.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Well, I didn't suspect the woman next to me, that's for sure!
</line><line>Garrideb:
Sitting in for the old bean whilst she's out of action, you know. But I know what her decision would be.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Does this mean I'll finally be able to get out of here and start work? ...Well, it's about time!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
I say, I'll have a corker of a story to tell the grandchildren when I get home, won't I?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I hereby demand your final decisions. Mr Foreman!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr Soseki Natsume... I hereby pronounce you...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
And finally, Mr Natsume...
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh! Yes, Lord, sir?
</line><line>Judge:
You are now a free man once more. It is my hope that you will continue to further your education in British culture. ...And may you never again be brought before me!
</line><line>Soseki:Oh, oh yes, sir. Of course! On my life...I SWEAR I'LL NEVER SET FOOT IN A COURTROOM AGAIN! I'm...
</line>
<center>Transported To Tears!</center>
<line>
Judge:
Thank you, Counsels. Court is adjourned!
</line>

<center><textEffects>20th February, 3:17 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</textEffects></center>
<line>
Soseki:
Oh, Locum!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Wait. You, you mean me?
</line><line>Soseki:
OF COURSE! Is there another locum here?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Is there even one?
</line><line>Susato:
Compared to the original 'Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire', your name has become rather short, hasn't it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...What's wrong with using my actual name?
</line><line>Soseki:Oh, at last! I'm free! I'm free!
</line>
<center>Joyful, Joyous, Jubilant Jubilation!Heady Hearty Happiness, Hurrah!</center>
<line>
Susato:
Oh, I am pleased! Mr Natsume is delighted!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Would it be so hard just to say that, then?
</line><line>Soseki:
Locum, you did it! You saved me from the brink!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, what happened to the poor woman was in no way your fault, after all. I'm just glad everyone can see that now.
</line><line>Soseki:NO NO NO! NOT THAT!
</line>
<center>Lovely Loyal Locum Lawyer!</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Um...yes?
</line><line>Soseki:
......... I mean, as I said before...I have just never got used to life here in Great Britain. Every time I look over my shoulder, I see foreigners. I see towering brick buildings. And from high-up windows, I see them looking down on me, laughing, 'Look at that little hunchback!'
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear, I'm sure it's all in your head, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:...But! Today! You, locum lawyer, gave my gloom the boot! You stood firm behind that baronial bench, before all those babbling British! You battled to the bitter end, laying bare the baffling truth! And when I beheld the blinding fireworks among the beams of the Bailey's roof, I bellowed:
</line>
<center>Behold the Best Barrister ever Born!</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Well, that's very flattering. And we're very pleased for you.
</line><line>Soseki:
This has given me a wonderful anecdote to recount to my old friends back in Japan.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
An, an anecdote? <textEffects>(Is that what's to become of all my hard work?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Ah, there you are, my dear fellows!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I apologise for keeping you waiting. I rose late this morning.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! What a pleasure to see you!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I see I am here not a moment too soon. A disaster has been averted, I'm glad to say!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
The trial shall begin presently, Mr Naruhodo. And I wish you the very best of luck.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...It's just finished.
</line><line>Sholmes:
What?! No! Then my haste was in vain?
</line><line>Soseki:
AAAAAARGH!!! It's...! It's...YOU! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh? Have we met, sir?
</line><line>Susato:
Um, this is Mr Natsume. The man you had arrested, Mr Sholmes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, I see. I failed to recognise you at first. Our previous encounters have taken place in the gloom. Either of your bleak lodgings or that prison cell. I simply couldn't place that curious face, in the light.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Charming.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
This is all your fault...Herr Lock Sholmes! You're the reason I had to go through this terrible ordeal! I'm...I'm going to give you...a piece of my mind!
</line><line>Sholmes:
My apologies, sir, but I assure you, I have placed you now. You're the fellow who abandoned that poor young lady and ran off, are you not?
</line><line>Soseki:
Ah.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Had she been taken to hospital more urgently... ...I feel perhaps she would have regained consciousness by now.
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh.
</line><line>Sholmes:
But it was unavoidable, I'm sure. We are but human, after all. Anyone would have been shaken by such an experience.
</line><line>Soseki:
......... I...do feel very badly about how I behaved.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, never mind. Now then, what was it that you wanted to say to me, sir?
</line><line>Soseki:
......... Nothing.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Priceless! Oh, I am sorry, really, but... ...that was quite priceless.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Poor Soseki-san...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Still, on the bright side, you've had an extremely entertaining experience without paying a penny! And, it would seem...you were not even found guilty.
</line><line>Soseki:
...But there is no bright side.
</line><line>Susato:
Whatever do you mean, Mr Natsume?
</line><line>Soseki:
Even after this, I'm... I'm still cursed! ...By the spirits. And... AND NOW BY THE REAPER!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah... <textEffects>(Lord van Zieks...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
I haven't forgotten, you know! What facing that man in court means! Even if you're found not guilty...YOU'RE STILL DOOMED!!!
</line><line>Susato:
It, it will all be alright, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:
Hm?
</line><line>Susato:
If the Reaper appears trying to make trouble... ...I will protect you!
</line>
<center>Haiiiiii-YA!</center>
<line>...With a perfectly executed Susato Takedown!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Much as I like being turned on my head, a bit of warning might be nice next time, Miss Susato. So, Mr Natsume...what do you intend to do now? You mentioned something about recounting your experiences to your friends back in Japan?
</line><line>Soseki:
......... Yes! I, I intend to return to my homeland soon.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh!
</line><line>Soseki:
It has already been a year since I arrived here in Great Britain. I've visited universities, libraries, bookshops... I've been honoured with the tutelage of professors... I've learnt so much about the wealth of literature here, and the city it has shaped. And I've come to realise that it is my calling to sail home and tell my fellow countrymen about it.
</line><line>Susato:
That's very touching, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Or, in perhaps less veiled terms... ...you wish to withdraw halfway around the world to escape the terror of the Reaper's curse?
</line><line>Soseki:
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL! The more I learn of literature, the more this strange feeling claws at my insides. I feel compelled to return to my roots and attempt to pen a work of my own.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see. <textEffects>(A work of literature by Soseki-san... Could be an interesting read.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
And what about Miss Susato and yourself, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What about us?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Will you return to Japan alongside your moustached compatriot?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Why would we?
</line><line>Susato:
A week has not yet passed since we arrived in London. And only now does it feel as though we have finally found our feet!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And...you are accommodated in a hotel at present, are you not?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. But we need to find lodgings before it bankrupts us.
</line><line>Susato:
I've calculated we can only afford another ten nights before our entire budget is exhausted.
</line><line>Soseki:
Well then! You could take my lodgings.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...The...windowless room?
</line><line>Soseki:
Ah, but what it lacks in windows, it more than makes up for with a floor, a ceiling AND walls.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Great.
</line><line>Soseki:
And of course, I'd be happy to leave behind the accursed evil spirit!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my! An evil spirit?!
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh yes. It tries to suffocate you while you sleep. It's, it's...an infallible wake-up call!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We'll...think about it, if that's alright.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Perhaps I can offer a more welcome alternative. Would you consider taking lodgings with me?
</line><line>Susato:
Really?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, a vacancy has conveniently presented itself. ...Though it is up in the attic, I might add.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Are you sure it isn't just a storage loft?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I spoke with the landlady this very morning on the matter of price. And Iris is cleaning the room as we speak. You must come at once. ...I presume you have no luggage to speak of?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, this is simply wonderful! What an honour! To be invited to taking lodgings in the great detective's office...'s attic! I'm...I'm too overcome for words!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...So suggesting we look elsewhere is out then.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Then it's settled. Iris will prepare a welcome dinner this evening. And you must come too, Mr Natsume. I insist!
</line><line>Soseki:
I...I...I...don't know what to say! But thank you! And yes!
</line><line>Susato:
Wonderful! Then I'll go and complete the paperwork for your formal release, Mr Natsume! It shan't take long!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Somebody's happy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
...Locum. I, I knew that you wouldn't let me down. I'm truly delighted to have met you here in London.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Likewise, Mr Natsume. It's been a privilege meeting you, too. It's a shame that we're going to have to say goodbye so soon.
</line><line>Soseki:
Well...I've come to realise that I belong in Japan. But, Locum! We'll meet again one day.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm sure. <textEffects>(And hopefully by then, I'll be a successful lawyer.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
Hopefully by then, I'll be a successful author.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, my dear fellow, our carriage appears to have arrived. Shall we go, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Sholmes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I've little doubt Mr Natsume will be released in time for dinner this evening.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
</line>
<center>And so... ...with Soseki-san's innocence successfully established... ...we rode with Mr Sholmes to what was to become our new home: 221B Baker Street.</center>

<center><textEffects>20th February, 4:41 pm.
The Attic Room</textEffects></center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
So this...
</line><line>Susato:
...Is to be our new office, yes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Our office...? I rather like the sound of that.
</line><line>Susato:
Me, too! It's simply wonderful, isn't it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I hope you can see this, Kazuma. It's only a small step... ...but I'd like to think we're getting a little closer to your dream now.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, my dear fellows! Do you like the place?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, Mr Sholmes... Yes, thank you so much.
</line><line>Susato:
It's a delightful room, Mr Sholmes! I simply adore it!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Good, I'm pleased to hear it. Iris and I are delighted to welcome you.
</line><line>Iris:
I hope everyone's hungry! It's nearly time for dinner. We'll eat as soon as Mr Natsume arrives. We have a lot to celebrate!
</line><line>Susato:
Iris, you must let me help you!
</line><line>Iris:
Alright then, Susie, you can be in charge of the salad.
</line><line>Susato:
Splendid!
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, Mr Naruhodo, how does it feel? To have your own office in the capital?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's very exciting, actually. I can't help wondering what adventures await us.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Those were precisely my sentiments when I first established my office at these premises. ...Until I discovered the dark truth about the city of London, that is.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Sholmes:
London is a glorious place, full of wonder, opportunity, prosperity and mirth. But the brightest of lights... ...casts the darkest of shadows.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Shadows? What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, I believe you're well aware of the murkiness that lies behind London's facade already. So once again, Mr Naruhodo... ...welcome to London!
</line>
<hr />
<center>Of course, at the time... ...I had no idea of the significance of those words Mr Sholmes so casually spoke. But it wasn't long before my turn came... ...to lift the facade and see the true depth of the murk that lay behind it.</center>
