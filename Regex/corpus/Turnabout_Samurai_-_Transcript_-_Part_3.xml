<line>Phoenix:
Whew, what a day.
</line><line>Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.
</line><line>Maya:
The director and producer...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, them.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!

Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.
</line><line>Maya:
You can say that again!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's not.
</line><line>Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?
</line><line>Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.
</line><line>Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.

Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.
</line><line>Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "<textEffects>Studio Two</textEffects>" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.
</line><line>Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!

It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?

No, that it does not.

Hey... There's a trailer over there.

It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.

Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!

R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.

That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.

Yes. With the director and the people from the network...

Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.

Impossible? Why?

The path was blocked.

You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?

M-"Mr. Monkey"?
</line><line>Vasquez:
The monkey with the broken head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right, that... <textEffects>(What an original name...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Vasquez:
Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capsice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.
</line><line>Maya:
W-what!?
</line><line>Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!
</line><line>Vasquez:
2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.

<textEffects>(It IS a monkey, after all.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Vasquez:
Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.
</line><line>Maya:
...! Nick, it's stopped at <textEffects>2:15</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
2:15...?
</line><line>Vasquez:
That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.

Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...

Oh, hi.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hello. What brings you here?
</line><line>Penny:
Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes?
</line><line>Penny:
The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, nope! She's the same as always.
</line><line>Mia:
Same as always.
</line><line>Penny:
Okay... whatever you say...

<line>Phoenix:
See this card?
</line><line>Cody:
Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.)</textEffects> R-right! Okay! How about a trade?
</line><line>Cody:
You're on! I'll give you a "Samurai Spear" and throw in an "Evil Magistrate" to boot!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.
</line><line>Cody:
Huh? You sure? Fine by me!
</line><line><textEffects>Gave URP Card to Cody.</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Got to think of something...)</textEffects> I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!
</line><line>Cody:
Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
</line><line>Cody:
I go to every live performance!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Cody:
I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
</line><line>Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
</line><line>Cody:
You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? "The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory." The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.
</line><line>Mia:
Really? Are you sure?
</line><line>Cody:
Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.
</line><line>Mia:
Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.
</line><line><textEffects>"Path to Glory" received.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
?

<line>(<i>Talking about "What you saw" leads to:</i>)
</line><line>Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?
</line><line>Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...
</line><line>Mia:
What is it, Cody?
</line><line>Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.
</line><line>Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Umm... right.)</textEffects> Mia?
</line><line>Mia:
Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.
</line><line>Mia:
True enough.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.
</line><line>Mia:
Indeed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is <textEffects>Will Powers</textEffects>!
</line><line>Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "<textEffects>guilty</textEffects>" for sure.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...
</line><line>Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.
</line><line>???:
Not so fast, pal!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!
</line><line>Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!
</line><line>Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!
</line><line>Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Great! Thanks, Mia!
</line><line>Mia:
See you soon.
