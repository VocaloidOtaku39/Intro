            <p>I was born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 26, 2003. I am the younger twin sister of Kayla Hopple, and I was born <strong>19 minutes after her!</strong></p>
            <p>On August 19, 2005, my family moved from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre, and it has been our home ever since.</p>

            <p>Kayla and I graduated from <a href="https://dallassd.com/">Dallas High School</a> in 2021, which is located in a remote town near Wilkes-Barre, where we have also made many outstanding achievements! Some of my most memorable achievements include:

                <li>Entering the spelling bee and winning third place both times</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                In our first two years of Penn State Wilkes-Barre, we continued to capture more achievements and creating a more successful future before us. Some of the most memorable awards and moments I have achieved at this campus are:

            <p>One of the best adventures my family has ever went on took place in June 2018, just after Kayla and I finished our freshman year in high school. We went on an educational trip to Arizona, where we learned about the Grand Canyon! </p> 
            <p>It was a five-hour flight from our Wilkes-Barre home to Phoenix, Arizona, and we stayed in a cabin-like inn, complete with an outdoor water park! </p>
            <p>Not only did we visit the Grand Canyon during our week-long trip, but we also visited the Arizona DiamondBacks, which was our first MLB game ever!</p>
            <p>Though we did suffer some jet lag after the flight back home, the whole adventure was worth it! It has been one of my favorite family adventures ever since!</p>
