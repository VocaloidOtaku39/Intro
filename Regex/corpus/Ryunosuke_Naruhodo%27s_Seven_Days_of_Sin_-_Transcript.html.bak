Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, <textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>. Are the counsels for the prosecution and the defence ready to proceed?
</line><line>Susato:
Judicial Assistant <textEffects>Susato Mikotoba</textEffects> for the defence... is ready, My Lord.
</line><line>Sholmes:
For the prosecution, I, <textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects>, naturally stand in full readiness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I, naturally...am not ready for this at all. I don't even know what it is that I'm supposed to have done.
</line><line>Susato:
No, that's right. When I heard that Mr Naruhodo was in trouble, I hurried here at once. But I have no information about the charge brought against him at all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I haven't done anything! <textEffects>The Great Ace Attorney</textEffects> is due to go on sale next week. I'm just trying to keep a low profile and prepare mentally for busy times ahead, that's all!
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, your brazenness knows no bounds. To call yourself a defence lawyer, having committed no less than <textEffects>seven</textEffects> crimes of the most serious nature!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! SEVEN crimes?!
</line><line>Susato:
What are you talking about, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Until every one of these <textEffects>unforgivable felonies</textEffects> has been fully examined in this courtroom... ...I shall not step down from this bench! THAT'S what I'm talking about, my dear fellows!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... You do realise...that's the prosecution counsel's bench, don't you?
</line><line>Susato:
I don't believe you should have stepped up to it in the first place.
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsels. Now, let us hear the charge brought by the prosecution.
</line><line>Sholmes:
As I said, there are <textEffects>seven charges</textEffects> against the accused, to be heard in <textEffects>seven consecutive trials</textEffects> this week. This evening, we examine the first of those charges - a most disturbing <textEffects>crime</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
What crime?! Of what does Mr Naruhodo stand accused?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Of <textEffects>leaking information</textEffects>, Miss Susato... as you well know.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh?
</line><line>Susato:
Leaking...information...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I still remember it clearly. The words out of the accused's mouth last night at the restaurant. The topic of conversation turned to The Great Ace Attorney, to be released next week. You recall, I presume, what blurted from your lips with no regard for the public setting?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...well, I think it was something like: 'I can't believe <textEffects>The Great Ace Attorney</textEffects> goes on sale next week! I can't wait to see what <textEffects>curious deductions</textEffects> Mr Sholmes comes out with this time!'
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely! There you have it! My gripe in a nutshell! This great detective's appearance in the title was supposed to be a great secret. A surreptitious surprise. I didn't want it to be common knowledge, shared with all and sundry. To speak of it so openly and indiscreetly... Upon my word, there can be no more repugnant crime!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really?
</line><line>Sholmes:
'<textEffects>Mr Sholmes</textEffects>', '<textEffects>curious deductions</textEffects>'... Both undeniable <textEffects>spoilers</textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426133548" class="image"><img alt="Hold it Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Hold it Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426133548" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Susato:
I think it's reasonable to say that Mr Naruhodo's words were simply '<textEffects>information</textEffects>', not '<textEffects>spoilers</textEffects>'. And I do believe that your appearance, Mr Sholmes, is already highly anticipated. In fact, that alone may account for many people's interest in the title.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Of all the words I'd use to describe your appearance, 'surreptitious' isn't one of them.
</line><line>Susato:
I wonder if perhaps your real gripe is with the description of your deductions as 'curious'?
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
You fail to see the seriousness of the crime... my learned friend, Miss Susato!
</line><line>Susato:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
You believe it to be a trifle. But in the world of mystery, there is nothing so important as trifles.
</line>
<center>The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, has committed <textEffects>the wilful and callous act of revealing spoilers</textEffects>...</center>
<line>...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: In the context of a tale of <textEffects>mystery</textEffects>, in which every <textEffects>leaked detail</textEffects> could be of significance... ...is it, or is it not, a crime to utter in public that which has already been <textEffects>made public</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sholmes:
All people have a right to knowledge, naturally. But they also have a right to ignorance.
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at <textEffects>five</textEffects> tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> or <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>? What say you, juror?
</line><line>Susato:
Until tomorrow evening then! Please deliberate carefully!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

<center>HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!</center>

Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the first charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
</line><line>Susato:
Myself and my client are very much opposed to the leaking of information, My Lord. However...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...A few minor spoilers can't really hurt, surely? I mean, just the fact that Mr Sholmes will appear is-
</line><line>Sholmes:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Sholmes:
'A few minor spoilers' you say? You fail to grasp the magnitude of the situation. The appearance of this great detective...can never be described as 'minor', Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Susato:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Susato:
The prosecution's last statement - and entire argument - is completely <textEffects>inconsistent</textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I, I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Susato:
If, as you say, you wish to keep the news of your appearance a secret, Mr Sholmes... ...then standing for the prosecution in this public trial as you are... That very act is surely a '<textEffects>spoiler</textEffects>' in itself!
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... ...I couldn't deny that isn't a possibility that doesn't make some logical sense.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it would appear that the matter is settled, then.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
</line>
<center>...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...<textEffects>not guilty</textEffects>!</center>
<line>Dear me. Not the conclusion I would have expected from a logical and reasonable jury, I must say.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much!
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
I happen to know of a certain gentleman... ...who was thoroughly estranged as a result of revealing 'a few minor spoilers'.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You do?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, I know your kind only too well. You're the sort of person... ...who would blithely say to someone new to the Herlock Sholmes stories: 'Sholmes, you say? Oh yes, wasn't he the man who dies in the end when he plummets from a cliff?' And suchlike. 'But then later on, it turns out that he didn't actually die at all!' And so on.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He's right, there should really have been a spoiler alert at the start of this trial.
</line><line>Susato:
But I'm sure the details aren't quite right...
</line><line>Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the first of the defendant's trials this week.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I trust you shall all attend the next trial.
</line><line>Susato:
Hopefully it will go as well as today, and Mr Naruhodo will be acquitted again!
</line><line>Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the <textEffects>second</textEffects> trial tomorrow evening!

I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, <textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this <textEffects>second trial</textEffects>?

<textEffects>Kazuma Asogi</textEffects> for the defence, My Lord. Yes, I'm ready.

<textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects> for the prosecution, My Lord. As ever, in complete and utter readiness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I, as ever...am in complete and utter unreadiness. What is it this time? I really have no idea what I'm supposed to have done!
</line><line>Sholmes:
The crime of which you stand accused tonight, my dear fellow...is that of <textEffects>dishonouring a lady</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kazuma:
<textEffects>Dishonouring</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A, <textEffects>a lady</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. The accused's judicial assistant, in fact.
</line><line>Kazuma:
<textEffects>Judicial Assistant Mikotoba</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I still remember it clearly. The words out of the accused's mouth last night at the restaurant. As the lady in question arose from her seat to leave, he noticed she had forgotten her purse. You recall, I presume, what blurted from your lips, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...well yes, I think it was something like: 'Oh! That looks like Susato-san's purse. I, I think you're forgetting something, <textEffects>Sasato-san</textEffects>! <textEffects>Susas-san</textEffects>! I mean, <textEffects>Susat-tsuan</textEffects>..."

Yes, certainly, to call one's own judicial assistant by the wrong name is a graceless blunder, but-

</line><line>Sholmes:
No buts, my learned friend! For that third attempt of '<textEffects>Susat-tsuan</textEffects>'... ...was perilously close to 'Su's Hat Swan'!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Just try it for yourself! Try to say that name <textEffects>three times in a row</textEffects> and see how you get on! You'll quickly find out that it's harder than your average tongue twister. The truth is...names that look prettiest on paper are <textEffects>a death trap</textEffects> for the mouth!
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<center>The accused has <textEffects>wrought great disgrace</textEffects> with an ill-fated twist of the tongue...</center>
<line>...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is failing to say '<textEffects>Susato-san</textEffects>' correctly <textEffects>three times in rapid succession</textEffects>... ...<textEffects>a crime</textEffects> worthy of punishment, or merely a result of <textEffects>a punishing name</textEffects> for the tongue?

The most beautiful names have a right to be pronounced beautifully.

</line><line>Kazuma:
It's clear that names with too many '<textEffects>s</textEffects>' sounds next to each other are very hard to say. So if anyone is guilty here, it's whoever conceived of such a name in the first place!

I'm afraid that sort of chicanery won't help you here. You see, I've been a step ahead of you from the start.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
W-What do you mean 'a step ahead'?
</line><line>Sholmes:
'<textEffects>Susato-san</textEffects>' is child's play. You Japanese have vowels between your esses. But we Englishmen stare the devil in the face with a fiendish <textEffects>triple ess</textEffects> in '<textEffects>Miss Susato</textEffects>'!
</line><line>Kazuma:
What?!

Go ahead, try it...if you dare! A <textEffects>rapid-fire triple</textEffects> '<textEffects>Miss Susato</textEffects>'!

A step ahead? That last claim of yours was <textEffects>a step too far</textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Since the beginning of this trial, I've been paying careful attention to your pronunciation, Mr Sholmes. And I'd say you've been <textEffects>doing your utmost</textEffects> to avoid saying the name of the lady in question. 
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah...
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's always been '<textEffects>the lady in question</textEffects>' or '<textEffects>your judicial assistant</textEffects>' or some such. Why? Simple... Because you know that you're very likely to dishonour the lady by <textEffects>mispronouncing her name</textEffects> yourself!
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........  ...I couldn't deny that that isn't something about which I haven't been not even slightly worried.

</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects> for the prosecution, My Lord. As ever, in complete and utter readiness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I, as ever...am completely unprepared. This is getting ridiculous! Night after night, my name being dragged through the mud...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And this night, you stand accused of <textEffects>overindulgence</textEffects>. You recall, I presume, the incident in question?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Of course I don't recall it! I've never even heard of overindulgence as a crime!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And yet you've perfectly illustrated my point with that bellicose '<textEffects>objection</textEffects>'!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Here we go...

</line><line>Iris:
The defence demands that Hurley explains what he's talking about!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm...perhaps before that... ...we might be able to bring the defence up to a slightly higher level?
</line><line>Sholmes:
An excellent suggestion. Pray, where are the potato crates kept in this courtroom?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Iris:
Oh, what a good view I have from up here!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, and what a charming young lawyer we had hiding in the courtroom.
</line><line>Iris:
Hee hee!
</line><line>Sholmes:
The accused will of course be aware of the name <textEffects>Hiro Shimono</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh? Oh, well, um...
</line><line>Iris:
Oh yes! The lovely <textEffects>Japanese voice actor</textEffects> who reads all Runo's lines!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Voice actor...? You're blaming me for that now?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I refer of course to the studio recording of your 'objection' line. You remember the occasion?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Tell the court, <textEffects>how many takes</textEffects> did you demand for the nebulous reason of being '<textEffects>dissatisfied</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm...I don't actually remember, but I imagine it was rather a lot?
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>Sixteen</textEffects> takes! On that one little phrase! Without sparing a single thought for Mr Shimono's vocal chords.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Good gracious indeed, My Lord. But that is not all. The following day, for reasons best known only to the accused, '<textEffects>dissatisfaction</textEffects>' struck again! The tireless Mr Shimono had to perform a further <textEffects>twelve</textEffects> takes of the phrase. Despite the fact that only a single 'objection' soundbite is used in the game!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<center>The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with <textEffects>objectionable overindulgence of Mr Shimono's vocal chords</textEffects>...</center>
<line>...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is <textEffects>twenty-eight</textEffects> takes of 'objection' indicative of <textEffects>pernicketiness</textEffects> or <textEffects>perfectionism</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sholmes:
No doubt the final 'objection' was an expression of Mr Shimono's true feelings on the matter.
</line><line>Iris:
Hmmm... ...you could be on to something, Hurley. <textEffects>Guilty</textEffects> as charged, I think.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Iris! Isn't a defence lawyer supposed to side with the defendant...?
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at <textEffects>five</textEffects> tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> or <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>? What say you, juror?
</line><line>Iris:
I need to go and cook dinner now, so I'll see you all tomorrow! Bye!

Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the third charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
</line><line>Iris:
Well! The defence has been making some enquiries and discovered vital evidence!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You, you have, Iris?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well well...most intriguing. Something relevant to this case?
</line><line>Iris:
Oh yes! Very relevant! It's all here in this file. As you said yesterday, Hurley, poor Mr Shimono had to perform that '<textEffects>objection</textEffects>' twenty-eight times in total. But it turns out that the take that was actually used in the end...was <textEffects>the very first one</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
...What a cruel taskmaster.

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're right, Iris, that was <textEffects>new information</textEffects>. But did you really need to share it with the court?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It may interest you to know that the 'objection' we just heard...was <textEffects>take number twenty-three</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
F... F... FORGIVE MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, pray tell the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: how do you find the accused?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
</line><line>Judge:
It would appear that the jurors are unanimous in their decision.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
</line>
<center>...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...<textEffects>guilty</textEffects>!</center>
<line>An unsurprising result. The worldly ladies and gentlemen of the jury are great allies of mine.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the third of the defendant's trials this week.

I trust you shall all attend the next trial.

I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, <textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this <textEffects>fourth</textEffects> trial?
</line><line>Susato:
Judicial Assistant <textEffects>Susato Mikotoba</textEffects> for the defence, My Lord. I am ready.
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects> for the prosecution, My Lord. In full readiness, as I'm sure you would expect.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm starting to get strangely used to spending my evenings in this dock... But I really shouldn't be here! <textEffects>The Great Ace Attorney</textEffects>'s release is...

</line><line>Sholmes:
That, my dear fellow, illustrates your <textEffects>crime</textEffects> to a tittle.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What does?
</line><line>Susato:
Could it be...that you're referring to the title of the work itself, Mr Sholmes? '<textEffects>The Great Ace Attorney</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Very astute, my dear madam. The uninspired preposing of '<textEffects>Great</textEffects>' to the front... ...is quite frankly an affront to the original title of '<textEffects>Ace Attorney</textEffects>'. Do you deny this <textEffects>crime of cheapening</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:

</line><line>Susato:
But...it's a rather good title, isn't it? 'The Great Ace Attorney'...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And just in case anyone cares, I'm not the one responsible for it.
</line><line>Susato:
Besides, any enduring follower of Capcom's titles would recognise the addition of 'great'... ...as akin to the addition of '<textEffects>super</textEffects>', which did spice up some <textEffects>ghouls and ghosts</textEffects> in the past.
</line><line>Sholmes:
You'd advocate that the next title in the series is dubbed '<textEffects>ultimate</textEffects>' then, I suppose?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
What would the prosecution's suggestion be for the title, may I ask?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, well, I should think... '<textEffects>The Great Detective Herlock Sholmes and his Sublime Sepia Deductions</textEffects>' or suchlike.
</line><line>Susato:

</line><line>Susato:
I fear that may be a little long, and...in many ways the protagonist is really Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In many ways, Miss Susato...? And Mr Sholmes... ...the trouble is your full name is so long. It's been suggested it's <textEffects>hard to use</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:

</line><line>Sholmes:
You can't casually throw an anonymous party's opinion into the mix! That's not playing by the rules! The real issue here...is that as a title 'The Great Ace Attorney'... ...makes all preceding titles seem somewhat less than great by comparison!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear...are we back on that again?
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is '<textEffects>The Great Ace Attorney</textEffects>' a <textEffects>tip-top</textEffects> title or a <textEffects>tawdry</textEffects> one?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It's not too late, you know. There's still time to imbue the title with a little sepia sublimeness.
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at <textEffects>five</textEffects> tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> or <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>?

Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the fourth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
</line><line>Susato:
It seems there was a very particular constraint when the title was being decided. Senior Capcom staff were insistent that '<textEffects>Ace Attorney</textEffects>' should feature in the title somewhere.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. Which is why the creative team came up with suggestions such as... '<textEffects>Ace Attorney Renaissance</textEffects>' and '<textEffects>Ace Attorney: Democracy</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Susato:
There was also '<textEffects>Ace Attorney: Industrial Revolution</textEffects>' and '<textEffects>Ace Attorney in London</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I also hear there was another candidate put forward: '<textEffects>Sholmes and the Ace Attorney</textEffects>'. ...Why oh why was that not chosen?!

</line><line>Susato:
That last statement of yours, Mr Sholmes, is completely <textEffects>inconsistent</textEffects> with your earlier argument!
</line><line>Sholmes:
S-Something I said...is inconsistent?
</line><line>Susato:
Three days ago, on the first of these trials, you made something very clear. That your appearance in this title was to be <textEffects>a closely guarded secret</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah...
</line><line>Susato:
That being the case, if the title you were hoping for had been chosen... ...it would have amounted to an unforgivable <textEffects>spoiler</textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... ...I couldn't deny that those aren't words that didn't perhaps usher from my lips not so very long ago.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!

This is a waste of time! All our energy should be focused on one thing now! There are only <textEffects>three days left</textEffects> before <textEffects>the release date</textEffects> and there's still so much to do!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And there, My Lord, is a perfect example of <textEffects>the crime</textEffects> for which the accused stands trial this evening. Mr Naruhodo, you recall, I presume, your <textEffects>suspicious behaviour</textEffects> of moments ago?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
S-Suspicious behaviour? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Your <textEffects>eyes</textEffects>, my dear fellow, your <textEffects>eyes</textEffects>! Two enormous <textEffects>dinner plates</textEffects> crammed into that sudating head, with <textEffects>a lone raisin</textEffects> rolling around on each.

</line><line>Kazuma:
What my learned friend fails to appreciate, is the resolve expressed by the defendant in the antechamber:
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
'The trials' about to get underway at last. I am <textEffects>hungry</textEffects> for this win!'
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
So while those dinner-plate eyes might seem to suggest the defendant is scared... ...what they really show...is <textEffects>the size</textEffects> of his <textEffects>appetite</textEffects> for victory!

</line><line>Sholmes:
Sadly, that is not the only telltale sign of the accused's panic-stricken mind.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Though out of sight from your side of the courtroom, I assure you the dinner plates are the tip of the iceberg. For underneath the dock... ...the accused's <textEffects>knees</textEffects> are <textEffects>knocking</textEffects> louder than His Lordship's gavel!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
A clear indication... ...of how shaken he is, as evidenced by <textEffects>all but two</textEffects> of the raisins being <textEffects>shaken off the plates</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<center>The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with <textEffects>disastrously dinner-plate eyes</textEffects>... </center>
<line>...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Are wide eyes and knocking knees an unavoidable <textEffects>display of nerves</textEffects>, or an unforgivable <textEffects>distraction</textEffects> for a lawyer?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I suggest you start looking for more raisins before all we can see are the whites of your eyes.
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at <textEffects>five</textEffects> tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> or <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>? What say you, juror?
</line><line>Kazuma:
This is a trial that we can't afford to lose. My reputation as a lawyer is at stake.

Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the fifth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are there any closing statements to be made?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Woefully <textEffects>wide eyes</textEffects> and cacophonic <textEffects>knocking knees</textEffects>... You Japanese have a curious manner. It's almost as if you wish to draw attention to your foibles.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What did you say?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It really is quite the most ridiculous thing. At times I think you're <textEffects>two plates short of a dinner set</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kazuma:
...I presume that's supposed to be some witty British idiom, is it? Is that the best the world-famous great detective can do?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Time to hear the court's decision, I think, don't you? So, pray tell, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: how do you find the accused?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Guilty!

Guilty!

Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...

<center>...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...<textEffects>guilty</textEffects>!</center>
<line>An unsurprising result. The worldly ladies and gentlemen of the jury are great allies of mine.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the fifth of the defendant's trials this week.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Grrr...talking about us Japanese like that... It's <textEffects>brazen mockery</textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Quite. <textEffects>Raisin crockery</textEffects> indeed! But really, there's no need for dried or sour grapes. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Kazuma:

<textEffects>Iris Wilson</textEffects>, My Lord, humbly representing the defence. I am ready, thank you, yes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects> for the prosecution. Ready and eager to proceed, My Lord.

The dock is starting to feel like my home port now. But how many times do I have to experience this sinking feeling before you're satisfied?

</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed! <textEffects>That very question</textEffects> brings us neatly to <textEffects>the crime</textEffects> of the day!
</line><line>Iris:
What have you got, Hurley?
</line><line>Sholmes:
How many times must the accused - or rather the accused and his defence-lawyering <textEffects>dynasty</textEffects>... ...stand accused in <textEffects>the dock</textEffects> before they are satisfied?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My defence-lawyering <textEffects>dynasty</textEffects>? What...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
You recall, I presume, your future relation by the name of <textEffects>Phoenix Wright</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I can't say the name rings a bell, no.
</line><line>Sholmes:
He, like you, is - or will be - a defence lawyer destined for the dock <textEffects>twice</textEffects>! No doubt his fate was predetermined by yours...which has seen you charged with <textEffects>seven</textEffects> crimes already. Between the pair of you, therefore, that's a total of <textEffects>nine</textEffects> court appearances as the accused!

</line><line>Iris:
One of those seven times isn't even part of <textEffects>the game</textEffects>, Hurley. It's in <textEffects>an escape room event</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>An event</textEffects>? Pray, what do you mean, Iris?
</line><line>Iris:
Haven't you heard of it? '<textEffects>Murder at the Old Bailey</textEffects>'. It's been <textEffects>hugely popular</textEffects> up and down the country!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, I'm delighted the public enjoys seeing Mr Naruhodo sweat as much as I.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And <textEffects>five</textEffects> of the seven appearances are <textEffects>the five trials</textEffects> I've had to endure this week! None of these have anything to do with the game at all!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, nevertheless... ...it's a poor protagonist who's so <textEffects>closely acquainted</textEffects> with the dock even before his adventures go on sale.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Uuugh...
</line><line>Sholmes:
If this trend continues, one can only presume... ...that great tribulations as well as trials await in the game itself!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<center>The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with <textEffects>excessive appearances of his dynasty in the dock</textEffects>... </center>
<line>...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
</line><line>Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: For members of <textEffects>the Naruhodo clan</textEffects>, whose role as <textEffects>protagonists</textEffects> in these tales is to uphold justice... ...is a total of <textEffects>nine</textEffects> appearances in the dock <textEffects>unsurprising</textEffects> or <textEffects>unforgivable</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I have little doubt that the number will continue to increase. As early as tomorrow evening, in fact.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I'll look forward to that.
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at <textEffects>five</textEffects> tomorrow for adjudication.

Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the sixth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are there any closing statements?
</line><line>Sholmes:
The prosecution acknowledges the recent rise in prominence of the so-called '<textEffects>dark hero</textEffects>'. The modern age has ushered the demise of protagonists of my kind: <textEffects>the guileless genius</textEffects> and champion of justice.
</line><line>Iris:
Oh Hurley, that was a masterstroke. You didn't even bat an eyelid.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...H-However! A hero so dark, his suit is as <textEffects>black as pitch</textEffects> and the dock is his <textEffects>permanent abode</textEffects>? That, I posit to the court, is <textEffects>a shade too far</textEffects>! <textEffects>Over-egging the black pudding</textEffects>!

I think you've overlooked something here, Hurley.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Pardon?
</line><line>Iris:
Nearly all the main characters that have appeared in <textEffects>Ace Attorney</textEffects> over the years... ...have been <textEffects>defendants</textEffects> of some description or another. And mostly hopeless cases at that.

W-What are you saying?

I'm saying... ...that being in the dock is a sure sign of a venerable <textEffects>Ace Attorney hero</textEffects>!

<textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects> for the defence. I'm more ready than I've ever been!

Well well, so you're vacating the dock in favour of the defence's bench at last, my dear fellow.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...For the past six days, I've watched my friends working tirelessly to advocate for me. But tonight I'm defending myself! I'll soon show you who's the fool from this side of the courtroom!

Laudable determination, Mr Naruhodo. And most timely. For this evening's proceedings call for <textEffects>redoubled</textEffects> efforts on my part, too. You see, the week's earlier accusations pale before <textEffects>the great crime</textEffects> of which you now stand accused!
