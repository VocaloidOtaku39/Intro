<line>Phoenix:
Ahh... Another fine day in the Kingdom of Khura'in. ..................... It's so peaceful here... <textEffects>(I can't believe it's been two weeks already, but... ...this place is really starting to grow on me. Still...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It sure was a rough start. Now, to do what I came here to do: To see Maya! Her long ascetic training is finally coming to an end. But before it does, she said something about <span style="color:#E16935">one last rite she has to perform</textEffects> today.)</span>
</line><line>???:
Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Hap'piraki!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, Ahlbi. Hap'piraki.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Oh, you've mastered the traditional greeting of Khura'in!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I don't know about that... <textEffects>(But I guess all that practicing is paying off!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Have you gotten used to life at the temple?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm grateful they're letting me stay here, but the mornings start a little too early for me.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Ha ha ha! Yes, well, morning prayers do begin at dawn! After all, you can never pray too much! Daily devotion is very important here in Khura'in!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hats off to you guys. I don't know how you do it.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
And today's a special day, full of even more prayer than usual! There's nothing better in this world than being able to pray to your heart's content!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I... can think of a few things I'd rather do...)</textEffects> So, what makes today so special anyway?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
You mean you don't know?! Today's the <textEffects>Purification Rite</textEffects>! It's only performed once a year!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's what Maya must've been talking about on the phone yesterday. I wonder what her role in it is...)</textEffects> ...So, what exactly is Maya going to be doing for this "<textEffects>Purification Rite</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
What?! Didn't she tell you?! She's playing the role of <textEffects>Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>! It's only the most important part of the entire rite! It's unprecedented to have a foreigner play such a key role!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wow, that's really something.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
It really is! Helping out such an amazing person... ...has been the greatest honor of this humble tour guide's life!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, who is this "<textEffects>Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>" you mentioned?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Allow me to explain! Once upon a time, hundreds upon hundreds of years ago... ...there lived a female warrior who fought valiantly to establish the Kingdom of Khura'in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me stop you right there!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Is something wrong?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, it's just... I get the feeling I'm in for a really long story.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Yeah... I'd say it normally takes around two hours to tell.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Whew, dodged a bullet there.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Oh, right! You're supposed to finally see Miss Maya today! The story can wait, then. In the meantime, you can read up on the rite with this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
An English guidebook? Where did you dig this up from?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
I found it just lying there in the temple library. I figured no one's using it, so I borrowed it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hm? Hey! This book belongs to Maya. See, there's her name on the back. Guess there's no harm in keeping this for a while, then.
</line><line><textEffects>Rites Guide added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Miss Maya should already be at the site where the rite is to take place. Let's go! ...To the Plaza of Devotion!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wonder if Maya's matured any since I last saw her.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
It's on a mountaintop, so it might get a little cold, though!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think I can handle it.

<line>Phoenix:
Brrr... I-I-It's s-s-so c-c-cold... <textEffects>(It's like the air itself is made of ice.)</textEffects> But look at all these people...
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Well, this IS the day we come to offer prayers to Lady Kee'ra, the protector of our land. It's amazing to see how devoted everyone is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Devoted... Right... But couldn't they just as easily do all this praying someplace warmer?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
This, too, is a part of our religious training! It helps us build strength of spirit and willpower! Further up, at the end of those stairs, is the <textEffects>Inner Sanctum</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see... Everyone I've met so far seems deeply religious.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Of course we are! After all, Khura'in is also known as the <textEffects>Land of Prayer</textEffects>. It's said that we Khura'inese spend an average of fifteen hours a day in prayer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! F-Fifteen...?!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
From the moment we wake, to the moment we fall asleep, our hearts are always in prayer. You see all the square flags around here? They're known as <textEffects>prayer flags</textEffects>. They contain the prayers of our people!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, he's talking about these colorful strips of cloth. There's something written on each one.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Such piety is the glory of our people, and...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I'm afraid that story's going to have to wait for another time, Ahlbi... Maya should be here any minute now.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Oh, yeah, you're right! I can't wait to see Miss Maya again.
</line><line>???:
...Pardon me, O noble traveler.

How do you fare, Mr. Wright? It's been many a day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-And, uh, who might you be? M-Maya?!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ahlbi:
Miss Maya! Hap'piraki!
</line><line>Maya:
Hap'piraki, Ahlbi. And you, Mr. Wright... May the Holy Mother guide you on your journey.
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........Oh, um, thanks.
</line><line>Maya:
...Hee hee! Long time no see, Nick! Well? Well? Did I surprise you with my act?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, you can say that again. <textEffects>(This is <span style="color:#E16935">Maya Fey</textEffects>. She's a spirit medium from <textEffects>Kurain Village</textEffects> back home. She was also my assistant for quite some time. ...But that was many years ago. Her ability to channel spirits saved me more times than I can count.)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
I sure miss those days. It was a ton of fun being the REAL boss of Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now she's here, training to be the leader of Kurain Village and the master of her craft. Apparently, to become the master of the Kurain Channeling Technique... ...you have to train here in Khura'in, since this is where the technique originated.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Didn't I sound just like a pious nun when you saw me just now?! Too bad that's about all I learned from all the training I did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. You haven't changed a bit, Maya.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? And what's THAT supposed to mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She may look a little more mature on the outside, but inside, she's the same old Maya. ...I'm actually kind of glad for that.)</textEffects>

<line>Maya:
Oh, I hear the sound of the high priest's footsteps. I'd better get going.
</line><line>Phoenix:
His footsteps?
</line><line>Maya:
During the rite, he wears these really big bells on his ankles. That way I know he's coming. Pretty handy, right? Well, see you later!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I doubt they're actually meant to be a "stop slacking" warning system for you, Maya...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Miss Maya is always so bright and cheerful!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I'm glad to see she hasn't changed. <textEffects>(As in, at all... I wonder if this means her training's been all for naught... I hope not.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Ah, it's Acolyte Zeh'lot.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acolyte Zeh'lot...?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Look, he's the one praying in the red and saffron robe. He's a disciple of the high priest, Abbot Inmee, and lives and trains at his house. See how he prays in the cold without moving a muscle? 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I could never do that...
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Ah, it's Abbot Inmee! The Purification Rite is about to begin! 
</line><line>Phoenix: So that's the sacred robe Maya will be wearing during the rite. It looks almost exactly like what that figure in the newspaper photo was wearing. <textEffects>(Whoever it is must've worked really hard to copy it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Please, sir,  it's not a good idea to stare like that. You could be struck blind!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just give me a few more seconds. I mean, this isn't something you see every day... ...Oh, those bells on the high priest's ankles... they're a lot bigger than I thought they'd be.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Mr. Wright! It's time to enter the prayer pose like everyone else. Those who don't will suffer the wrath of the Holy Mother!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, let's see... First, I kneel down and cross my ankles, and then I bow forward... Youch! Great... Now all I can see is the ground, and my back is killing me!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
You really should have trained for this, sir...
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Wait a sec... How long are we supposed to stay like this, Ahlbi?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
The rite requires that we stay like this... until the day after tomorrow.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's two whole days! Nngh... I don't feel so...
</line><line>Ahlbi:
M-Mr. Wright! Are you okay, sir?! S-Somebody, heeelp!
</line>

...ster... Wri... Mist... ...ight? Mister Wright! Please, you have to get up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh... Ouch, my aching...! ...Hm? Where are we?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
The high priest's house at the foot of the Plaza of Devotion!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess I passed out from that back pain. They must've carried me all the way here.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Something terrible's happened! It's Miss Maya! She's... She's... Ooh, justfollow me to the Plaza of Devotion!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Something must've happened while I was passed out.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi: Miss Maya's... She's been arrested!

B-But I'm telling you! I-I... I haven't done anything wrong!
</line><line>Policeman:
Hmph. You can talk all you want back at the station.
</line><line>Maya:
L-Let me go!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! I didn't kill him! I swear I didn't!

I don't know who you are, but if you don't get out of my way--!
</line><line>???:
Hey! Back off, officer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Ema? Ema Skye?! <textEffects>(What's she doing in Khura'in?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... but we're placing Maya under arrest. All right, take her down to the station! But with respect -- got it?!
</line><line>Policeman:
Yes, ma'am!
</line><line>Maya:
N-Niiiiiiiiiiiiiick!
</line><line>Ema:
...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, what are you doing in Khura'in, Ema?
</line><line>Ema:
It's a long story. Anyway, what are YOU doing in Khura'in, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Same here -- it's a long story. But we can get caught up later. Right now, I need to know what happened.
</line><line>Ema:
Maya's... well... under arrest for the murder of the high priest.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, the high priest was... murdered?

<line>Phoenix:
Would it be okay for me to go take a look at the crime scene, Ema?
</line><line>Ema:
The police have already wrapped up their investigation... ...but the location itself is off-limits to the general public, so I'm not sure.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema, please! I'm begging you! Just like the police, I need access if I'm to mount a viable defense.
</line><line>Ema:
...All right, then. Leave it to me! I'll explain the situation to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi and the police later. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks, Ema!
</line><line>Ema:
You have quite a climb ahead of you, so be sure to watch your step!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Wait, you're not coming with me?
</line><line>Ema:
O-Oh, no, I'm not climbing up there again. No way.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-Is it really that bad? I wonder if my back can handle it...
</line><line>Ahlbi:
You get to go to the Inner Sanctum?! Oh, you're so lucky, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why don't you join me, Ahlbi?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Th-Th-That's crazy talk, sir! If a commoner like myself were to set foot in there, I'd surely be cursed for all eternity!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because the Inner Sanctum is off-limits for you, huh... Oh, well... Guess I'll just have to face this all by my lonesome. By the way, what about all the people still praying here? Aren't they going to go home?
</line><line>Ema:
The customs of this rite require that they not move from this spot until tomorrow afternoon. It doesn't faze them to have police milling about. Some of them are even off-duty cops.
</line><line>Phoenix: Wow, I guess this is what it's like to live in a deeply religious society, huh...

What's wrong? I didn't surprise you THAT badly, did I?

Oh, no, it's nothing. Actually, I've been looking for you. I wanted to tell you I investigated the crime scene. I hope it wasn't too much trouble getting my investigation of the Inner Sanctum approved.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, it was fine. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi gave his okay straight away.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm, he seems like a rather fair-minded prosecutor.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
He said that you would probably give up once you saw the crime scene for yourself. ...And that moving on before the trial began would be the smart thing to do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(.........He must be feeling really confident about his case.)</textEffects> Well, just so you know, I have no intention of giving up.
</line><line>Ema:
I figured! That's why I've prepared a little gift for you! I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport.

<textEffects>(Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.)</textEffects>

Also, I made a copy of the crime scene photo for you!

That's because <textEffects>His Ephemeral Holiness</textEffects> is a real slave driver.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"His Ephemeral Holiness"...?
</line><line>Ema:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. He's like the world's hardest riddle, wrapped in a flowy sash. I keep wondering if it's just a clash-of-cultures type of thing, you know? Like, he'll ask the most insane things of me without batting a single, long eyelash of his!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm, this Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds like he's used to holding some serious clout...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Argh! Why do I have such bad luck with prosecutors! First it was the <textEffects>glimmerous fop</textEffects>. And now that I'm finally rid of that grating, bling-loving Europhile, I get this guy! Oh, no! Now I'm really going to be late! He'll probably make me listen to one of those really long sutras again. I'll see you later!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He makes her listen to sutras? Sounds like Ema's got it pretty rough, too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
She does not appreciate Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's sutras? What ingratitude. It appears that she, too, is lacking in religious devotion.

It's just, you know they have that Defense Culpability Act here in Khura'in, right? Well, if I'm found guilty... you'll be charged with abetting a criminal.

Yeah... But we're not in Kansas anymore, you know?

True, but I've been through one trial here already. So I know what I'm getting myself into. We're going to win this one, no matter what. Because I <textEffects>believe</textEffects> in your innocence.

Is Miss Maya okay? I believe her, Mr. Wright. I know she didn't do it!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Do you now, boy?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
P-Pohlkunkaaa! Y-Y-Your Benevolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
You mustn't trust in lawyers, you... Hm? Are you not the accused from the last trial?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Oh, u-um...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's wrong, Ahlbi?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Y-Your... Your Benevolence speaks... with the... um...
</line><line>Rayfa:
You may speak in the vernacular, little monk. Now, what is your name?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Y-Yes, Your Benevolence! Ahlbi Ur'gaid, Your Benevolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Know this, Ahlbi: Your soul is only as clean or filthy as the company you keep.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wish she'd stop insinuating that all lawyers are trash.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
P-Please forgive me, Your Benevolence, but Mr. Wright is a very trustworthy man. A-And I... I trust him as a lawyer!
</line><line>Rayfa:
.........What's this?!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
I-I'm sorry! ...F-Forgive my insolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
I-If a common boy such as he can place his trust in lawyers... ...it can only be because of my failure at the Hall of Justice the other day. Ooooooh...
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Mr. Wright! Her Benevolence has sunken to the ground!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She must really feel responsible for what happened in court that day... Let's give her some breathing room for now. I'm sure she'll be back on her feet in no time. In the meantime, do you mind if I ask you some questions?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Of course not! I'm always glad to help!

<line>Phoenix:
So, is there anything else you can tell me about the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra, Ahlbi?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Umm, I was just thinking there was something else, but what was it...? Oh, yeah! Here!
</line><line>Phoenix: What is it?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Shah'do found it!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Why that's... the <textEffects>Warbaa'd Arrow</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Feeling better now, Your Benevolence?
</line><line>Rayfa:
This is no time to be feeling sorry for myself. For I am the crown princess of Khura'in! Now, let me see that, boy.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Y-Yes, Your Benevolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmm... It looks very much like one of the legendary weapons Lady Kee'ra once used in battle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A <textEffects>three-pronged</textEffects> arrow? <textEffects>(I could swear I've seen something resembling that arrowhead recently...)</textEffects> Where did Shah'do find it, Ahlbi?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Near Abbot Inmee's house.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Near the victim's house, huh... Something tells me I'd better look into this.)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Warbaa'd Arrow added to the Court Record.</textEffects>

Ahlbi, can I ask you to take me to the high priest's house?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Y-Yes, of course!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, he was married, wasn't he? And his <span style="color:#E16935">wife</textEffects> is the one who usually plays the part of Lady Kee'ra in the Purification Rite. I should probably talk to her, too.)</span>

Please forgive the intrusion, Lady Beh'leeb.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Oh, my... Y-Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Please, be at ease. What a terrible time this must be for you. I owe much to your husband. You have my deepest sympathies for your tragic loss.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
You honor me with your kind words. Look dear, the royal priestess has come to visit us. Yes... Mm-hm. ...What's that? ...Oh, of course... hee hee.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sh- She's talking with his funeral picture!)</textEffects>

My husband, too, is delighted that the royal priestess has graced us with her presence.

Y-You can speak with Abbot Inmee?

No, I don't possess the power to speak with the dead. But I can feel his presence. ...What's that? No, that can wait till later, dear.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sh-She's definitely speaking with him!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
...So, Your Benevolence. What is it that brings you to my humble abode?
</line><line>Rayfa:
This lawyer is investigating your husband's death. And I am watching him to ensure he does not tamper with any of the evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know this must be difficult, but could I ask you some questions? A good friend of mine has fallen under suspicion, you see.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
A friend of yours...? So then, you must be Maya's friend from the States... correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
...I'm sorry, but I'm still grieving. ...Isn't that right, dear?...Yes, I know.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Abbot Inmee and his wife were one of the closest and most loving couples in Khura'in. If she is not ready to talk, I will not allow you to press her any further.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She did just lose the love of her life... It would be incredibly insensitive of me to force answers out of her right now. But I need to talk to her if I want to learn more about the high priest. Plus, there's the <span style="color:#E16935">Warbaa'd Arrow</textEffects> that Ahlbi found near the house.

</line><line>Rayfa:
Barbed Head! Have you not been listening to a word I said?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look, Your Benevolence. I'm sorry for her loss, but I'm running out of time. So what I will do is promise to leave if she doesn't change her mind.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Please, let me talk to my husband about this. ...Yes. Mm-hm. I know... No, don't. Not in front of the royal priestess. Now, if you would excuse me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh- What the heck were they even talking about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
You have but poured salt on her wounds. This is precisely why you lawyers are so despised!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk! <textEffects>(I was just trying to help Maya's case. I didn't mean to hurt Mrs. Inmee...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Could it be that you actually possess a conscience?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course I do! But I'm also desperate for information.
</line><line>Rayfa:
...So, what do you plan to do now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pass the time by looking around the room, I guess, and see if she changes her mind.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Just see that you do not touch anything you should not.

Lady Beh'leeb, you don't have to speak to this lawyer if it is not your wish.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
No, it's quite all right. If my husband were still with us, he would say... "As much as it pains me to have my lovely wife speak on such matters..." "...if it would help to find the truth... then ask whatever you may."
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Okay, I'll take you up on your generous offer. <textEffects>(Wait... Did Mrs. Inmee call herself "lovely" just now?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course...

<line>Phoenix:
It was <textEffects>the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>. Everyone's talking about her. 
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
"I know not of what you speak."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Really? Because she even made the front page recently.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
"Kwah kah kah kah kah!" "I am but a humble servant of Lady Kee'ra." "What reason would she have to kill someone as insignificant as I?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually... <textEffects>I have something that just might show why Lady Kee'ra would kill Abbot Inmee.</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is a <textEffects>letter of warning</textEffects> from Lady Kee'ra. Maya found it. It was in the <textEffects>Inner Sanctum</textEffects> -- and only Maya and your husband were there at the time.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Augh!

<line>Phoenix:
This letter reached its intended recipient, your husband -- the high priest -- didn't it?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
And how do you know Maya wasn't lying to you? Because I've never seen that letter before, and I doubt my husband ever did, either.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but... <textEffects>I have evidence that proves this warning was meant for your husband.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Beh'leeb:
Wh-What's that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's an envelope... <textEffects>addressed to the high 
priest</textEffects>. The warning letter was delivered to your husband inside this, wasn't it?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Augh!
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Beh'leeb:
"...What nonsense is this?" "How can you prove the warning was delivered in this envelope?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... There's gotta be some way to prove it... Wait a second. Don't the envelope and the warning letter have something in common?)</textEffects> ...I think there just might be something that links the envelope to the warning letter.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
"There is?!"
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, and that <textEffects>proof</textEffects> is right here on the <textEffects>warning letter</textEffects>. <textEffects>This spot on the warning letter proves that it was delivered in that envelope!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>three holes</textEffects> in the envelope... ...are in the same shape and arrangement as the holes in the warning letter. And if you fold the letter in thirds and place it in the envelope, the holes line up.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Augh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>As for what made the holes... I believe it was this...!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
They were made by this <textEffects>Warbaa'd Arrow</textEffects> -- one of the weapons favored by Lady Kee'ra. The warning was folded in thirds, placed in the envelope addressed to the high priest... ...and <textEffects>delivered to your husband on the points of this arrow</textEffects>!

</line><line>Beh'leeb:
"Your Benevolence..." "May you swiftly shine light upon the truth."

Barbed Head. You seem bent on casting suspicion upon Lady Kee'ra. And by doing so, you seek to deflect the blame from the real killer, Maya Fey. That is the only logical conclusion.

...Gnrk! <textEffects>(I'm in no position to disprove her at this point. If only I could find something to support my theory that the high priest was a rebel...

Yes. My mother has decreed that a rite shall be held for the high priest's passing. And that she shall conduct the Prayer of Lament therein.

Her Eminence has so decreed, has she?! Oh, but she should not concern herself with a humble priest like my husband.

No, it is only natural, considering his meritorious service. The rite will be held at the palace. You are to 
accompany me there at once, Lady Beh'leeb.

Mr. Wright, Your Benevolence!

Are you done with your investigation for today?

Pretty much. I thought I'd go over what I've learned so far. Care to join me?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Yes! Please allow me to help!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay. First, we know that the high priest received a warning three days ago. It was from someone claiming to be Lady Kee'ra, and it told him not to perform the rite.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
That's right! It was that <textEffects>rebel hunter</textEffects>. But what of it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's what I'm not sure of yet. Why would Lady Kee'ra want to stop the rite?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
If you could solve that mystery...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. I could figure out her <textEffects>motive</textEffects> for threatening the high priest. It might be the break I need, but I just don't know enough right now to act on that lead.
</line><line>Rayfa:
How unfortunate for you, Barbed Head. Your only hope is pure speculation. That shall not stand up in the Hall of Justice. You have no actual proof of Lady Kee'ra's involvement in this crime, after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah...The warning letter alone can't prove who killed the high priest.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
I'll give you one last chance to withdraw before you are charged under the DC Act.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Your Benevolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
While it is true you did not forge or suppress any evidence... ...that is, perhaps, a product of my careful monitoring of your every move.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wasn't planning to do anything like that in the first place, Your Benevolence. But I AM going to prove Maya's innocence, within the confines of the law!
</line><line>Rayfa:
H-How can you be so sure you will?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because of my undying faith in my clients. That is a lawyer's greatest weapon.
</line><line>Rayfa:
.................. Hmph. What nonsense. You have chosen to dig your own grave. When next we meet, it shall be in the Hall of Justice. As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination Séance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Tomorrow... I'll be defending Maya in that so-called Hall of Justice again. That whole Séance thing makes trials here completely different from those back home. Plus, I don't have a shred of conclusive evidence. On the other hand, I've got plenty of confusion and anxiety to spare. I'll have to think of something. After all, I'm the only lawyer in all of Khura'in. I have to do this. I WILL do this! I'll prove Maya's innocence if it's the last thing I do!)</textEffects>
