Athena:
Apollo is a tough guy, but this is all taking its toll on him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. Poor guy, being attacked by Tonate like that on top of all his other injuries. <textEffects>(Apollo is resting at the nearby Hickfield Clinic. I've had some experience with that place myself. What an awful turn of events. I never thought he'd land in a hospital of all places...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
You must miss him, too, huh? Now that you don't have anybody to tease. Don't worry. He's young. He'll heal quickly and be back before you know it!
</line><line>Trucy:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's been a while since I last saw Trucy look so down... We won the court case, yet nobody feels much like celebrating...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
*sniffle* Mnnnph... All right, enough of this, people! This is no time to be moping around! Now, dry those eyes! Both of you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, you're the only one who's crying, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
Technicalities! Look, we have work to do! We have to <textEffects>take over</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Umm, <textEffects>take over</textEffects> what, exactly...?
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo's Space Center case, of course! As no verdict's been reached, there's still a chance!
</line><line>Trucy:
I agree with Athena. We should pick up Mr. Starbuck's defense. We have to avenge our fallen comrade! Right, Daddy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Apollo hasn't exactly "fallen." He's still alive, you know...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Good! Now that that's settled, let's get going! C'mon, we gotta run!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait? Right NOW, now?! <textEffects>(We'd better not be running the whole way!)</textEffects> ...There she goes. I'd better go catch up. *sigh* Can you take care of the office, Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
Sure thing, Daddy! Let's be careful out there! In the meantime, I'm going to bake some cookies and fill up my magic panties for you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Trucy seems to be feeling a little better. I can always count on Athena to perk everybody up with her enthusiasm.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh! She's back!
</line><line>Athena:
Don't mind me! Just forgot a few things! ...Wallet, phone, the documents, my bag...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sounds more like you forgot everything. <textEffects>(I can always count on Athena for that, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
All right, you two. Let's be careful out there!

Detention Center - Visitor's Room</textEffects></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
So our client is one <textEffects>Solomon Starbuck</textEffects>. He's so famous, even I've heard of him.
</line><line>Athena:
That's right! He's a super-famous astronaut who works at the Cosmos Space Center! He was actually up in outer space seven years ago!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You seem to know quite a bit about him. <textEffects>(Now I'm all excited to meet the man!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow. That was the longest sigh I've ever heard.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
Apollo told me all about you... You're Phoenix Wright, Apollo's mentor, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, that's right. <textEffects>(Hmm, mentor has a nice ring to it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Starbuck! Mr. Wright and I have got you covered!
</line><line>Starbuck:
Ahh, and you're... the new kid that Apollo told me about. ......Wait! Don't I know you from somewhere?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? Y-You mean... other than at your trial? I don't think so...
</line><line>Starbuck:
...I guess so. My mistake. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... My memory isn't what it used to be. My mind and body are kaput. Same goes for my life. I mean, I'm so astronomically unlucky that I had a bomb go off in the middle of my trial! Trying to defend me would be like trying to enter the stratosphere without a spacecraft.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yikes. He's SERIOUSLY got to stop depressing himself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Cheer up, Mr. Starbuck! Besides, that thing you said about entering the stratosphere... That just means we'd shine like shooting stars, right?
</line><line>Starbuck:
Like shooting stars, huh...? You know, you're right! Why didn't I think of that?! After all, that's what we were all put on this Earth to do, right? To shine like stars!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Guess I shouldn't mention the fact that shooting stars burn out in a flash...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
Aw, yeah! Here we goooooo! Three! Two! One! To the stratosphere and beyond! Yeah! I feel alive now! You can go ahead and ask me anything you want!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that really all it takes?)</textEffects>

<line>Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... From the freedom of space to the walls of a cell... But that prosecutor said the dark, night sky isn't half bad through barred windows.
</line><line>Athena:
............You're fine! Solomon "Sol" Starbuck is fine! Everything is going to be all right!
</line><line>Starbuck:
Huh?
</line><line>Athena:
And Athena Cykes is fine! C'mon, Mr. Wright! You, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I really have to...?)</textEffects> Phoenix Wright is fine...
</line><line>Athena:
I can't heeeeeeear youuuuuuu!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ph-Phoenix Wright is fine!
</line><line>Athena:
We'll get you back into space yet, Mr. Starbuck! Believe in your own innocence, and have faith in us!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apollo believed in you wholeheartedly, and that's good enough for me. I believe in you, too!
</line><line>Starbuck:
............Thank you. Thank you, both of you. I'll put my faith in you. And I vow to make it back into space! All I need first is a "not guilty" verdict!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It sure feels nice to reassure ourselves every now and then that we're all fine.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, Mr. Wright! Let's get our investigation of the Space Center started! Pronto!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good idea. Let's go!

Cosmos Space Center - Entrance</textEffects></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
Wow. I was wondering what kind of place this space center would be. It almost looks like an amusement park of the future.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah! Did you know they even let the public see their rockets up close? Oh! So, check it out! Look at how brightly the <textEffects>GYAXA</textEffects> logo shines in the sunlight above the entranceway! I really dig the stars and rocket motif it's got going!
</line><line>Phoenix:
GYAXA, huh? Isn't that the new name of the federal space R&amp;D program?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, but why the strange acronym? I mean, what is GYA supposed to stand for? Galaxy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that were it, then the whole thing would be something like "Galaxy eXploration Agency"... ...which, if you ask me, I'd have abbreviated to GAXA... or even GAEA.
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... I guess so... Oh, I know! Maybe the person who came up with the name just really likes the letter Y!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This exchange is beginning to feel oddly like déjà vu...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Anyway, this place is more than just a research facility; it's also a tourist attraction!
</line><line>???:
Tourist attraction? Don't make me laugh! It's a monument to the human race! Galactic Scooter, full speed ahead!
</line><line>Athena:
Yikes! Who's this geezer and what's he want...?
</line><line>???:
Look upon me, and look well! Behold the great power of space science!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pardon me, but you are...?
</line><line>???:
My glorious name is Yuri Cosmos! I am the director of the Cosmos Space Center, the "center of the cosmos"!
</line><line>Athena:
Boss... That was pretty groan-inducing...
</line><line>Phoenix:
If this person is the Space Center's director, then that means...
</line><line>Athena:
Aha! So you were one of the first to discover Clay's body, weren't you?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
And who was the first to find the victim?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Actually, there were two of them!
</line><line>Blackquill:
The Space Center director... ...Yuri Cosmos... and Detective Candice Arme.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Cosmos:
That is correct! I was honored to be the very first man in all of space and time to discover the body. But this talk of the incident... Are you by any chance... the space police?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You can't tack the word "space" onto just any old thing, you know.)</textEffects> We're Mr. Starbuck's lawyers. We're here to investigate this case.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, and we're Earth lawyers, by the way.
</line><line>Cosmos:
Ah, I see. Yes, I've heard about you. In that case, by my esteemed privilege, I grant you permission to investigate. I trust you are appropriately grateful. Now, go ahead! Have at it!
</line><line>Athena:
I can already tell he's going to be nothing but trouble.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't let him hear you say that or you'll see what trouble really is. Let's just be professional and ask him about when he found the body, okay?
</line>

<line>Cosmos:
Well, I will be on my way. As you can see, I am a very busy, and very important man! Galactic Scooter! Fire up the main engine! Max battle speed! And... engage!

<textEffects>(That thing is surprisingly fast.)</textEffects> I guess we'd better get going, too.

You bet! Let's make it so!

Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge</textEffects></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
So this is where Mr. Terran was murdered...
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, this is the lounge. Let's see that diagram the police made again. Right now we're in the main building here on the right side, on the third floor. Clay and Mr. Starbuck fled here from Launch Pad 1 after the explosion.
</line><line>Policeman:
You there! No admittance without express permission!
</line><line>Athena:
We're Mr. Starbuck's lawyers. We've come to investigate...
</line><line>Policeman:
Sorry! Nobody gets in without permission. Not even the police superintendent! Can't have Detective Fulbright getting mad at me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So Detective Fulbright is here, huh?
</line><line>Policeman:
Yeah, he's in the Launch Pad 1 Corridor. Go get clearance from him, and then we'll talk!
</line><line>Athena:
Leave it to me! I'm great at getting intel out of Detective Fulbright! Let's see. What trick should I use on him today?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't know if I should be grateful or afraid.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
So... to get to the Launch Pad 1 Corridor... ...we just have to go through that door with the blue rocket on it, I think.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait. That door... It looks awfully familiar...
</line><line>Athena:
Good eye there, Boss. This is the door Clay and Mr. Starbuck used during their escape from the launch pad.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, that explains it.
</line><line>Athena:
The fingerprint system has been deactivated, so I think we can just pass through. Now, come on! Let's go!
</line>

Cosmos Space Center - Launch Pad 1 Corridor</textEffects></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
So this is it, huh? This is the corridor the two of them used in their escape.
</line><line>Athena:
Yup. This is the only thing connecting Launch Pad 1 with the main building.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see police tape down at the other end. Guess we won't be looking at the launch pad.
</line><line>Athena:
After the explosion, this whole corridor must've been filled with smoke.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And the launch pad itself was probably a sea of flames. Must've been pretty scary for them.
</line><line>Athena:
...Now, where could Detective Fulbright be...? Hey, I think that's him over there!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Hmm... What should I do? Which path is the path of justice...?
</line><line>Athena:
He seems to be lost... That's funny. This corridor is a straight shot.
</line><line>Fulbright:
...Huh? Ah, it's you lawyer people! Welcome to the Space Center! Enjoying a relaxing day off, are you? Here for a little rocket sightseeing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We're here to investigate the scene, same as you. Do you have any info to share?
</line><line>Athena:
Boss, if he acts at all reluctant to give us information... ...we hit him with the "Whatever shall we do?" act! I'm sure he'll fall for it! Got it?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Are we trying to catch the unruly family dog here or something?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Info on the case, huh? .........All right! I'll gladly share some with you!
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? What just happened?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Detectives and lawyers, seeking truth and justice side by side! I like it! Just take whatever you want from me, you info bandits! I'm in a generous mood today!
</line><line>Athena:
I dunno... There's something weird about Detective Fulbright today...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we need information, so let's run with it.
</line><line>Athena:
If you say so...

<line>Athena:
Gee, you sure are being cooperative, Detective. A little TOO cooperative, even...
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yes, well... Actually... I...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Something you can't talk about...?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yes, something like that. Anyway, never mind! Don't worry about me! W-Well, I'll be on my way, now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What was that all about?
</line><line>Athena:
Something is definitely going on. I'm going to get it out of him the next time I see him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Okay... <textEffects>(I'm not so sure he'll talk about it, though.)</textEffects> Well, we have permission to investigate now. Let's head back to the boarding lounge.

Policeman:
Ah, you two! Detective Fulbright has granted you permission to investigate! He also said I should bring you some snacks or give you a neck rub, too, if you'd like...
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, uh, that's all right. But thank you for the offer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, time to roll up our sleeves and start investigating. Now, let's see... Where's that diagram again? So, this lounge is on the third floor of the main building. And according to Apollo, this is where he believes a third party killed his friend.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, let's stop the recap and start looking for traces of this third person then!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You read my mind, Athena. We'll make that our first priority. There's just one problem, though. This room... It's just so big...
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, we can use this to help us!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A Space Center pamphlet? For tourists?
</line><line>Athena:
Yup! Picked it up at the entrance. The maps inside should come in handy! Let's see... Yup. Here it is. A map of the lounge. This is the door we went through to talk to Detective Fulbright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh yeah. That's the door with the fingerprint recognition lock. Well, I guess this map will make things a little easier.
</line><line><textEffects>Space Center Pamphlet added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah! No more excuses! Let's track down the third person!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Wait. There's just one more thing. What's that strange creature moving around outside the window?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Boss... It's just a holographic image.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I knew that. <textEffects>(Whew, that's a relief.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
There should be a button somewhere in this room to turn the image on and off. That's what it says in the pamphlet, anyway.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only reason you're so eager to start is so that you can push that button, isn't it?
</line><line>Athena:
And what's wrong with that? Let's just look for the button while we're looking for clues.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Fine. Let's get investigating!

Hm? Did you just mouth "Psyched"? Is there something I should be psyched about?

No, no. "Psyche-Lock." It's a system of locks on the secrets in a person's heart. I can see when people are trying to hide those secrets by using the power of this Magatama. <textEffects>(Presenting evidence can break those locks... ...and reveal any secrets they're hiding.)</textEffects>

I really understand what's been bothering you, Detective. I truly do. Something happened that goes against your principles, isn't that right?

U-Uh, no... I don't know what you're talking about... Until the explosions occurred, everything was just fine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Is that a fact?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yup! Peaceful as peaceful can be! Everyone whistling a happy tune as they did their job. You never saw a more relaxed guard detail for a routine rocket launch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't think the guard detail was as "relaxed" as you claim as long as this exists.
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Before the explosions, what was supposed to happen here was a rocket launch. And yet security was so tight they even brought in a special task force. I'd hardly describe that as a "relaxed guard detail."

Hmrgh!

As versatile as you are, I can certainly believe that's true. But I say it's very strange that THIS person would be part of that detail from the outset!

<line>Phoenix:
Detective Arme specialized in bomb cases. The fact that she was here on-hand... ...means that you people knew there was the possibility that a bombing would occur.

Okay! Welcome back, Hunk of Junk! You don't know how close you came! If you didn't snap out of it, I was going to put you on the curb on trash day. Nothing works better than a 42.5 degree karate chop.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's pretty specific...)</textEffects> Excuse me, but are you the one who witnessed the murder? Oh, and I'm Phoenix Wright, the lead attorney for this case. How do you do?
</line><line>???:
Hmph. Big-shot lawyers, huh? I'm <textEffects>Aura Blackquill</textEffects>. I'm a researcher developing robots here at the Cosmos Space Center.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Blackquill"?! Could she be...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Aura:
And this good-for-nothing robot is named Hunk of Junk.
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>My name isn't Hunk of Junk! My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Clonco</textEffects>! That's mean, Miss Aura!</span>
</line><line>Aura:
Quit complaining! Your model number is "PONCO-2"!
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>Gaaagh! But Miss Aura! Everyone calls me "Clonco."</textEffects>
</line><line>Aura:
Quit your squawking already.
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>No! What are you doing?! No! Don't............</textEffects>
</line><line>Aura:
There! I bet you won't be talking back now!
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>Gaaagh! I will obey completely...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yikes! I'd better watch what wires I cross with this one!)</textEffects>

<line>Aura:
By the way, I heard the rumors. Our director is going to be the star witness in court tomorrow, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Director Cosmos? Yes, that's right.
</line><line>Aura:
You poor things. You'd better be careful. That old man is a big liar and a huge braggart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Aura:
He might seem like a bigwig, but the Center has all kinds of problems. He has a lot of skeletons in his closet. But it's your problem, so why should I care?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What, that's it? No friendly tips? No "Good luck, guys?"... Just splendid.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Aura:
I'll leave you to your woes. Come on, Hunk of Junk!
</line><line>Athena:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's sad to me that she doesn't believe in our legal system anymore. She must've had a very bad experience to make her feel that way. .........Are you all right, Athena? You seem very down.
</line><line>Athena:
Grrr! I just can't believe she said all those things!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow, she's really upset. Has she been trying not to let it show all this time?)</textEffects> Well, I guess it's not all that surprising... You hear about fabricated evidence and false indictments on the news all the time.
</line><line>Athena:
You mean that whole "<textEffects>dark age of the law</textEffects>" nonsense? I'm so sick of hearing about that!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, all we can do is believe in what we're doing.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah... You're right, Boss! I agree!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe it's time we went back to see Mr. Starbuck.
</line><line>Athena:
Good idea! We should tell him about the bullet and Ms. Blackquill's statement!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, then! Next stop: the Detention Center!

Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... My lawyers are here. It must be bad news.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey, not necessarily!)</textEffects> We found a new witness. A researcher saw the moment of the murder through the lounge window during her escape.
</line><line>Starbuck:
Really?! So they're going to let me go?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unfortunately... it was dark, and she couldn't identify the person.
</line><line>Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I should've known... My stars never align just right, too...
</line><line>Athena:
But we got a lead, too, Mr. Starbuck! The murderer had a lighter with an Earth emblem on it!
</line><line>Starbuck:
A lighter with an Earth emblem? ............Ooooohhhh!
</line><line>Athena:
D-Did you remember something?
</line><line>Starbuck:
Yup, I sure did! Just a little bit, though.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anything at all would be a help, so please tell us what you remembered!

<line>Athena:
If we can prove there was this <textEffects>third person</textEffects> at the scene and that they're the real killer... ...then you'll be cleared of all suspicion!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The key will be whether or not we can identify this third person in court tomorrow. At least we have something to go on now, and that's a big plus. <textEffects>(I should probably tidy the evidence up a bit, before someone mistakes me for a hoarder...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Irrelevant evidence tidied up.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Now that we have a glimmer of hope, I'm suddenly starving! Why don't we go back to the office and treat ourselves to a big celebration in advance?!

So, you found your strategy for tomorrow's trial, huh? Good for you, Daddy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it's one step forward, anyway. Hopefully it'll give us a fighting chance in court. <textEffects>(As long as we can find out who this third person is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Now let's get something to eat! I'm starving! My vote is for Eldoon's Noodles!
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh! <textEffects>Apollo</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you doing here? I didn't think the clinic was ready to release you yet.
</line><line>Apollo:
My wounds are fine. And I'm done lying around.
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo! You're supposed to be in bed! Leave the case to us. We'll take it from here!
</line><line>Apollo:
Thanks, but that's not an option. Not for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Apollo...)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
............Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'll be taking a leave of absence.
</line><line>Trucy:
WH-WHAT?!
</line><line>Athena:
Wait! What do you mean by "a leave"?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're really serious... Can you at least give me a reason why?
</line><line>Apollo:
When I put Clay's jacked on, I swore to him that I would catch his killer myself.
</line><line>Athena:
B-But that's our goal, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I agree with Athena. We should work together to find the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
The <textEffects>truth</textEffects>, huh? That's a noble cause. But what if the truth you seek and the truth I seek turn out to be different?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... I'm not sure I follow... <textEffects>(What are you saying, Apollo...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm going to catch the person responsible for taking my friend's life, in my own way. Take good care of Mr. Starbuck for me. Now, I must be going... Goodbye.
</line><line>Trucy:
"Goodbye"...? Did he just say "goodbye"...?!
</line><line>Athena:
I sensed a lot of anger and hatred coming from him... And also... suspicion. Argh! He's NOT walking out on us like this! I'm going to go talk some sense into him!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hold on, Athena. Apollo can believe what he wants, but I believe he's wrong. Even if we take different paths, the truth we arrive at should be the same. I think the quicker we solve this case, the better it'll be for Apollo.
</line><line>Athena:
Y-Yeah, you're right, Boss.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. That's enough for one day. Make sure you're ready for tomorrow's trial, okay?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If he were here right now, Apollo would say... "I'm fine! Everything is fine!" ...I just hope things really do turn out fine tomorrow...)</textEffects>
