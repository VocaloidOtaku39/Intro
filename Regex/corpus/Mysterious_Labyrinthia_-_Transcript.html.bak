<line><i>Horse-Drawn Wagon</i>
</line><line>Luke:
Uh, umm... Eh? Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Good. I'm glad to see you're awake.
</line><line>Luke:
Ugh...yeah. Glad to be back...
</line><line>Layton:
Are you feeling all right?
</line><line>Luke:
Um, yeah, I'm fine. A bit drowsy though... I guess I just fell asleep all of a sudden. ............Ah! Wait, now I remember! Professor, what happened with the witches?! And...where exactly are we?!
</line><line>Layton:
Well, Luke, I've only just woken up myself. We've been here in this horse-drawn wagon since I awoke.
</line><line>Luke:
H-how did we end up asleep in a wagon?!
</line><line>Layton:
That is something we must now find out. First of all, where are we? And secondly, where are we being taken? There's another passenger over there. Let's start by asking her.
</line><line>Luke:
Good thinking, Professor!
</line>

<line>Layton:
Excuse me, but I wonder if you could tell us where this wagon is heading?
</line><line>???:
Where it's heading? ...That really is a meaningless question. It goes without saying, since there's only one place we could possibly be heading.
</line><line>Layton:
...I'm not sure I entirely follow.
</line><line>Luke:
Um... What do you mean by "one place"?
</line><line>???:
............ If you really want to know, why don't you ask the wagon driver? Although, whether you ask or not, we'll be arriving at our destination soon anyway.
</line><line>Luke:
If that's the case, surely it wouldn't hurt to just tell us...
</line><line>Layton:
Luke... Let's take her advice. We may have better luck with the driver.
</line><line>Luke:
All right...if you say so.
</line><line>???:

<line>Wagon Driver:
Hee-hee, so you finally woke up, did you? I was wondering what to do with you both... I was starting to think you'd never wake up.
</line><line>Luke:
E-excuse me, but... where is it that we're going?
</line><line>Wagon Driver:
Me-oh-my! You didn't get into this wagon without knowing where it's headed, did you?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, in truth, we only just became aware that we were in here. Until just a moment ago, we were at Tower Bridge, in London. I'm afraid we have no recollection of having boarded this wagon.
</line><line>Wagon Driver:
Hee-hee, you certainly say the strangest things. You're both still half asleep, aren't you?
</line><line>Luke:
Half asleep...? Of course not!
</line><line>Wagon Driver:
As far as I remember, you've both been in this wagon from the very start.
</line><line>Luke:
There's no way that's right! And besides...
</line><line>Wagon Driver:
Now, now, don't get so worked up, sonny. You'll upset the other passengers. I know nothing about the two of you, except from what I've seen. My job is just to carry my passengers... ...to that town.
</line><line>Layton:
A town, you say...?
</line><line>Wagon Driver:
Well looky here, it's just come into sight! Why not take a peek out, hmm?

Captain! All present and accounted for, sir!
</line><line>Captain:
Ahem! I want you to keep it in mind, men, that the peace of this town is in your hands. Never forget that no matter what happens, the people look to you to keep the peace! We proud knights of the order will always protect the people!
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! For honour and glory!
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Captain, Captain!
</line><line>Captain:
Hmm...? What can I do for you, my little ones?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
I want to join the order of knights and patrol the streets like you!
</line><line>Captain:
Ha ha! That's an upstanding ambition, lad. Perhaps, when you're a little bigger...
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Yes, sir! I'll do my very best to grow up as soon as I can, sir!
</line><line>Captain:
Hmm. I like your spirit, young man! Be seeing you.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Oh, you look so pleased with yourself! You don't really think a weakling like you could join the order of knights, do you?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Hey, that's not a nice thing to say. Every boy wants to be a knight...
</line><line>Bardly:
</line>
<center>Oh, what can he do, For one sweet as you? This bardly bard called Bardly♪</center>
<line>
Muffet:
Could you sing me a wittle song? Something womantic, to melt my heart?
</line><line>Bardly:
</line>
<center>Oh, fair maiden, the pleasure is mine. A worthy song, for a love such as thine♪ Oh, the love in your heart, And the love in your head, Is full and warm, like freshly baked bread♪</center>
<line>
Muffet:
...Sweeeeet!
</line><line>Luke:
P-Professor! Look at those people over there! They're all wearing period costumes. I've never seen that in London!
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm...you're right, Luke. This town would appear to resemble the one we saw pictured in that book... Although I'm somewhat puzzled as to how we have ended up here...
</line><line>???:
There is nothing strange about any of this...
</line><line>Layton:
............!
</line><line>Luke:
Ah! You're the passenger from the wagon.
</line><line>???:
The fact that we are here now is a <textEffects>predetermined</textEffects> turn of events.
</line><line>Luke:
Wh-what do you mean?! We were just brought here from outside...
</line><line>???:
This "outside" of which you speak... Just what exactly are you referring to?
</line><line>Luke:
Huh? Well, I mean London, of course...
</line><line>???:
There is no such place. Nor is there any such thing as an "outside". Not here...not in <textEffects>Labyrinthia</textEffects>...
</line><line>Layton:
............! Labyrinthia...
</line><line>Luke:
Wh-what?! You mean this is really Labyrinthia? Even so, that doesn't mean that London doesn't exist! If we went back the way we came, we'd be bound to come across it eventually!
</line><line>???:
If you don't believe me, then why don't you take a look with your own eyes?
</line><line>Luke:
</line>
<center>Ahh?! Professor! The gate is gone!</center>
<line>
Layton:
</line>
<center>............?!</center>
<line>
Luke:
</line>
<center>The gate we came through was right behind us, wasn't it?</center>
<line>
Layton:
</line>
<center>Hmm...yes, it certainly was there.</center>
<line>
Luke:
</line>
<center>So if that's the case, why does no one around here seem surprised? Seeing such a big gate <textEffects>disappear</textEffects> like that...</center>
<line>H-hey...where did she go?
</line><line>Layton:
This is most perplexing...
</line><line>Luke:
What's going on here...?
</line><line>Layton:
If this really is <textEffects>Labyrinthia</textEffects>, then... Could it be that we have somehow ended up inside that book...?
</line><line>Luke:
You mean the book Espella was showing us, don't you? The <textEffects>Historia Labyrinthia</textEffects>...
</line><line>Layton:
That's right, Luke. Do you recall what happened to us at Tower Bridge?
</line><line>Luke:
Well, I remember when that book started glowing. But after that, I'm totally blank...
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Luke:
Professor...you don't think we've somehow been pulled inside that book, do you?
</line><line>Layton:
It's a bit early to be drawing conclusions just yet, my boy. There are quite a few people around here. Let's start off by asking a few questions.
</line>

<line>Captain:
You've finished patrolling this area, then?
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! Nothing to report at present, sir!
</line><line>Captain:
Hmm, we must be even more on our guard than usual today.
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! Oh, by the way, Captain...
</line><line>Captain:
Yes?
</line><line>Knight:
I don't mean to alarm you, but there appears to be a couple of unusual characters approaching our vicinity, sir!
</line><line>Captain:
What?! Oi there, you two! What business do you have with the order of knights?
</line><line>Luke:
Oh, er...well, um...we just wanted to ask a few questions about the area... Um, about the order of knights... Are you really...real knights?
</line><line>Captain:
What's that?! You're not poking fun at the order of knights, are you?!
</line><line>Layton:
That was certainly not our intention. We were merely noting that your appearance is somewhat unusual...
</line><line>Captain:
You're saying we're unusual, are you? Well, that's an unusual thing to say... We usually patrol Labyrinthia, doing our usual duty of keeping the usual order. Tell me, what's unusual about that? If anyone's unusual here, it's you two! And I find it quite unusual that I've never seen either of you characters before. Which part of the town are you from?
</line><line>Luke:
We, um...just came here in the back of a wagon, through the gate over there. But then we noticed the gate has vanished. You didn't see anything, did you?
</line><line>Captain:
Gate? What gate?
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Luke:
But, there was a gate... We just came through it, from outside...
</line><line>Captain:
...Outside? Now I've been patient with you two, but nothing you're saying makes a lick of sense.
</line><line>Layton:
My apologies. I'm afraid it has been a while since we've been here on the main street. And I seem to remember there having been a gate of some sort around here...
</line><line>Luke:
But, Professor...
</line><line>Layton:
Luke, I think it would be prudent to play along here.
</line><line>Captain:
There's definitely something fishy about you two...
</line><line>Knight:
Captain, I don't suppose these two are...
</line><line>Captain:
No, I doubt that. Although they do look and act strangely...
</line><line>Knight:
Maybe, we could test them to see if they really do live here?
</line><line>Captain:
A test... Yes, that might be a good idea. I know a good way of deciding whether you two are dubious characters or not.
</line><line>Luke:
Wh-what are you going to do?
</line><line>Captain:
Well, it's very simple. If you really are upstanding members of this community, then you'll be able to solve this.
</line><line>Luke:
Solve? Solve what...?
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm. Luke, it appears this town has puzzles similar to those of our own world.
</line><line>Captain:
What are you mumbling about? Are you ready? Then here we go!
</line>

<line>
Captain:
Mmm...truly impressive puzzle solving! Of course, any member of our community could solve it... But those who can solve it with this level of insight are few and far between. You are no longer under suspicion. Although I must advise you to speak and act with more caution henceforth. Today being a <textEffects>special day</textEffects>, we are on an even higher level of alert than usual.
</line><line>Luke:
It seemed a bit touch and go for a moment, but I think we've convinced him.
</line><line>Layton:
Not only that, but it seems that puzzles are a familiar concept here. Which means that if we run into trouble, we should be able to overcome it through our usual puzzle-solving approach.
</line><line>Luke:
That's good to know! That puzzle was a bit different to what we are used to, though...
</line><line>Layton:
It seemed to be a puzzle rather unique to this town. And all the more worth solving for it, wouldn't you say, Luke?
</line><line>Luke:
Too right, Professor! So what's our next step...?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, my boy, first and foremost... I suggest we take a look around and investigate this town of Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Luke:
All right, let's do that! But where should we start...? We know next to nothing about this town...
</line><line>Layton:
That's true, Luke. Although, if you recall, we do know somebody who has been here before us.
</line><line>Luke:
Ah! You mean Carmine, right?!
</line><line>Layton:
Precisely. It appears that Carmine was able to leave this town and return to London. However, it would also appear that he was unaware of how me managed to do so...
</line><line>Luke:
So you mean, Carmine's activities here may be our only clue to getting back?
</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid so, Luke. First things first, let's see if we can find any signs of his presence here.
</line><line>Luke:
Right you are, Professor! Let's start investigating!

<line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
I haven't seen you two around here before! Do you know where you're standing?
</line><line>Luke:
Well, I might be wrong...but I think we're in Labyrinthia...
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
That's not what I mean! You tell 'em, Cecil.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Me? Uh, well... It's just that this is OUR territory, you see?
</line><line>Luke:
Your territory...?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
That's right. You two just went and walked right into our territory.
</line><line>Luke:
Oh, I get it. You mean we walked into the area you always play in, right? Sorry, we didn't realise... Do you mind if we join you here for a while?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You heard 'em... Whaddya think?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
I guess it'd be all right. The more the merrier, I say.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Fine, here's what we'll do. If you can solve this puzzle, then you can stick around.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
It's our initiation test!
</line>

<line>
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Hey, you're pretty good.
</line><line>Luke:
That was a piece of cake. After all, solving puzzles is my speciality!
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Yeah, me too. It'd only take me ten seconds to solve a puzzle like that.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Really? I didn't know you solved puzzles.
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You...just keep out of this! Nobody asked you! Anyway, you're now an official member as promised. From now on, you're number two.
</line><line>Luke:
Number two?
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Yep! I'm number one!
</line><line>Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You should feel proud. As number two, you can walk around the town freely. Not only that, but I'll let you in on a secret. If you check those green flags over there, you'll find something I hid there.
</line><line>Luke:
Um, okay, thanks! Somehow...I get the feeling that even if I hadn't become number two, I could have walked around the town freely...

Luke:
Wow, are you singing for us?
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, how fascinating! This man is clearly a minstrel.
</line><line>Luke:
Minstrel? There were around in the Middle Ages, weren't they?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. In the Middle Ages, minstrels were a kind of professional musician or poet. Although I do find it a little embarrassing to be referred to as a "lost sheep"...
</line><line>Luke:
Well, at least it's better than being called a little lost lamb, right, Professor?

<center>Little lost lambs, please have no fear! The bard, your shepherd, Is standing right here♪ Labyrinthine town, so your ways be known, I shall give the lambs a map, Of their very own♪</center>

You're right, Luke...I did prefer sheep. But it is most kind of this gentleman to provide us with a map of the town.
</line><line>Bardly:
</line>
<center>It is my pleasure, it is my delight! I am only doing, what is right♪</center>

Thank you, minstrel! This map will come in handy.

Wow, a bakery! And it smells so good...
</line><line>Petter:
If it's the bakery you want, they're out at the moment. But they should be back soon.
</line><line>Luke:
That's too bad...
</line><line>Petter:
But don't you think the taste of the bread has changed a bit recently? And the people working there seem somehow different, too. But then, I also feel like they've always been working there...
</line><line>Layton:
Do you mean to say you're not certain?
</line><line>Petter:
No...I'm not. It's just that somehow I have the feeling that there are more people working there now.
</line><line>Layton:
There is something I would like to ask you. How knowledgeable are you about the people of this town?
</line><line>Petter:
The people? Well, I have lived here all of my life, so I guess I know most of them. Why do you want to know?
</line><line>Layton:
I would just like to know if you have ever met a man called Carmine.
</line><line>Petter:
Carmine? Hmmm... Sorry, but no. I've never seen nor heard of anyone by that name.
</line><line>Layton:
You've never heard of him? How curious...
</line><line>Luke:
Do you think he was just going under a different name here?
</line><line>Layton:

</line><line>Petter:
More importantly, shouldn't you two be on your way? Everyone else is already heading there.

Is there something else we should be doing?

Are you kidding?! With all the townspeople getting so excited like this? You two must be waiting as well, right? Why not kill some time with a puzzle?

Petter:
Pulling the strings is far better than having your strings pulled, don't you think? Bravo, brilliantly solved.
</line><line>Layton:
Thank you. So something really is about to happen?
</line><line>Petter:
You seriously don't know? Ha! Amazing! To think that there could be anyone in town who could be so clueless... Well, if you don't know... Why not come and see for yourselves? As they say, seeing is believing. Or should it be, "a picture is worth a thousand words"? I'm sure you get what I mean...
</line><line>Luke:
He could have just told us... This is all a bit exasperating.
</line><line>Layton:
Well, it looks as if we'll just have to go and see for ourselves. As soon as we've finished looking around, let's head for North Parade Avenue.

<line>Knight:
This is definitely the best weapon shop! I could blow a month's pay in this place! This sword, this axe and this mace... And that new shield over there... What more could a knight like me ask for?
</line><line>Layton:
They all seem to be painstakingly crafted. But I can't help but wonder how a knight would be able to move with all this equipped.
</line><line>Knight:
A soldier unable to wear this equipment is not fit to be called a knight! What's more, this amount of equipment is but the bare minimum required to effectively oust wrongdoers. Such a knave might come at me just like this...
</line>

<line>
Knight:
Yow saw right through that shadowy deception with consummate ease! Such powers of observation are outstanding! If you notice anything untoward, be sure to let me know immediately.
</line><line>Layton:
Certainly, we'd be pleased to help. Unfortunately, villains tend to be careful too.
</line><line>Knight:
Hmm...recently I've heard many tales about badly behaved youths. It seems there are two in particular who are up to no good together. I intend to deal with them before any of the townsfolk fall foul to their misdeeds. So I must remain on my guard at all times, in case they suddenly appear!
</line><line>Luke:
He's definitely a knightly sort of knight! But these streets seem so peaceful, it's hard to imagine any "villains" around here. It's a shame...
</line><line>Layton:
Well, we must hope they apprehend those individuals soon. Let's offer our support too, where we can.
</line><line>Luke:
Right you are, Professor!

Then your future is assured! A sharp mind is essential for success. With a mind as sharp as yours, you could even take over my business some day!

Just imagining you as a pawnbroker is certainly an entertaining image, Luke.

Indeed. But, something would appear to be amiss...
</line><line>Muffet:
Eeek! This stowy is too howwible!
</line><line>Tuggit:
Without a doubt, this is terrible...
</line><line>Mailer:
Th-this...doesn't look good. Today, I'll finish up my deliveries and go home early!
</line><line>Luke:
Up until a moment ago everyone was so excited... But now that the parade has passed, the mood here seems totally different.
</line><line>Layton:
They all seem to be afraid of something.
</line><line>Luke:
Yes, it's very strange... Ah! Professor, there's one of those sheets of paper over there.
</line><line>Layton:
That must be one of the sheets that the knights were throwing to the crowd. The problem seems to be related to what is written on those sheets of paper.
</line><line>Luke:
Hang on, I'll pick one of them up. This doesn't look like a typical letter or anything like that...
</line><line>Layton:
It's hard to imagine what could be so terrible... Let's start by giving it a read through.
</line><line>Luke:
Okay, Professor!

<center>The fearsome witch moved deeper into the moonlit wood, casting a deathly shadow as she passed between the trees. And when the two young companions stepped into the darkness of the wood, they were drawn into her magic fire, and their lives were consumed in its flames.</center>

<center><b>NEW MYSTERY</b></center>
<center><b>The Storyteller</b></center>
<line><b>After finding themselves in Labyrinthia, the professor and Luke saw the parade of the town's creator, the Storyteller. But on reading the Story that was distributed to them, the townsfolk became afraid.</b>
<i>The horrific Story on the piece of paper described how two young companions would be burned to death by a witch.</i>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Luke:
What could that mean? A witch again?! And what about where it says, "their lives were consumed in the flames"?
</line><line>Layton:
Luke, let us cast our minds back to what Espella said in London... I seem to recall her mentioning that those witches had followed her from Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Luke:
So that would mean...that the witches we saw in London really were from this town... The witch in this story... Do you think she's the one from before?
</line><line>Layton:
It's still too early to say. But at any rate, this seemingly prophetic story, is rather disturbing...
</line><line>Muffet:
I onwy came here to see Inquisitor Barnham! And this...this stowy is what I get! Oh my, what bad wuck this is!
</line><line>Tuggit:
Oh no-no-no! Things had been so peaceful, and now the witch is to strike once again... What a fearful world we live in.
</line><line>Mary:
What a horrible story! I can't stay here any longer. I'm heading straight back to the market stall, where I can be with my lovely little goats!
</line><line>Layton:
Well, it seems that what's written here is indeed the reason for all this unrest.
</line><line>Luke:
It's definitely a little ominous... But it's only a story, isn't it?
</line><line>Muffet:
It's pwecisely because it's the Stowy that we're all so afwaid! Don't you even know that much?
</line><line>Tuggit:
Without fail... Whenever a witch appears, somebody dies!
</line><line>Luke:
Even if what you say is true, there's no reason to be afraid. After all, it's just a story. It's hardly going to become a reality...
</line><line>Muffet:
...What are you saying?!
</line><line>Tuggit:
Yes, what do you mean by that?!
</line><line>Luke:
Eh?
</line><line>Muffet:
You're not impwying that you don't bewieve in the Stowy, are you?!
</line><line>Tuggit:
No-no-no...no-no-no... Nooooooo!
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Tuggit:
You'll get your comeuppance for this!
</line><line>Knight:
Hmm? Hey, you two! What's all the fuss about?!
</line><line>Luke:
Us? Um, nothing...we're not making a fuss!
</line><line>Captain:
What is it? Is something the matter?
</line><line>Knight:
Captain! It's these two, sir! They're creating a bit of a disturbance...
</line><line>Captain:
Well, well, it's you two... Causing trouble again, are you?
</line><line>Tuggit:
Ah, Captain! These two here are claiming that the Story won't become a reality! How can they say such a thing?!
</line><line>Captain:
What's that?! This simply can't be... You claim that you don't believe what the Storyteller writes? ............! Could it be that you two...?
</line>
<center>No...it couldn't be...</center>
<center>A moment ago they were claiming to have seen a witch... Honestly, that's what they were saying!</center>
<center>Look, there are two of them! They could be the two in the Story!</center>
<center>The pair that gets killed by the witch... Well, they could be...</center>
<center>Even if they're not, they must have something to do with the witch...</center>
<line>
Luke:
P-Professor...
</line><line>Layton:
This atmosphere is somewhat unsettling...
</line><line>Captain:
It appears my original instincts regarding you two were indeed well founded! You're clearly suspicious! Men, surround them!
</line><line>Luke:
Uh-oh...
</line><line>Layton:
...Easy, Luke!
</line><line>Luke:
P-Professor! This isn't good... Perhaps we should make a run for it!
</line><line>Layton:
Agreed...but running off blindly in any old direction is unlikely to prove successful... We're too unfamiliar with the streets of this town.
</line><line>Captain:
Oi! I wouldn't think of running if I were you! Just give up peacefully.
</line><line>Luke:

The voice came from that back street over there... Come on, Luke...let's run!
</line><line>Luke:
Okay, Professor!
</line><line>Captain:
Oi, wait! Stop! Come back here! After them, men! They're getting away!

<center>It appears we've managed to elude them... But what now?</center>
<line>
Luke:
</line>
<center>We can't stay here... They're bound to find us sooner or later.</center>
<line>
Espella:
</line>
<center>Let's move elsewhere. If we keep to the back streets, we should be able to reach the square without being seen. Follow me!</center>

</line><line>Layton:
That was rather too close for comfort. It seems you rescued us this time...
</line><line>Espella:
It was nothing. I'm just glad you were both able to get away safely. But...what are you both doing here in Labyrinthia?
</line><line>Luke:
We'd like to ask you the same question! What about you, Espella? What happened after we were separated in London? I remember you jumping aboard that cargo vessel... Did you have any trouble getting away?
</line><line>Espella:
Well, I...uh...that is, I...
</line><line>Layton:
Easy now, Luke. We mustn't bombard Espella with questions like that.
</line><line>Luke:
I-I'm sorry, Espella...
</line><line>Espella:
No, I'm the one who should apologise. I'm afraid it's just not very clear...
</line><line>Layton:
You have no reason to apologise, Espella. But when you say it's "not very clear", what do you mean, precisely?
</line><line>Espella:
Well, to be honest...I seem to be unable to clearly recall what happened...
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm...is that so...? After we put you aboard that ship, we should have followed after you... But at any rate, I'm relieved to see that you're all right now.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, I am. Thanks to you both. It's good that we could meet again like this. I'm so happy to see you here!
</line><line>Luke:
Too right! We're both very happy too, aren't we, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
We certainly are, Luke.
</line><line>Espella:
Let me guess... You both came here to solve the puzzles of Labyrinthia, didn't you?
</line><line>Luke:
Um, well, yes...something like that. Right, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Actually, the truth of the matter is, we don't really know why we're here.
</line><line>Espella:
Eh...?
</line><line>Layton:
It seems as if... Well, it's almost as if we've been sucked right into that book's story.
</line><line>Espella:
Sucked into...the Story?
</line><line>Layton:
If it's okay with you, Espella, I'd like to ask you some questions about Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Luke:
We can't really settle down here for a chat, can we? Those knights might find us again! We'll need somewhere to lie low for a while.
</line><line>Espella:
............ Ah, I know! If it's all right with you two...
</line><line>Luke:
Yes?
</line><line>Espella:
For now, Mrs Eclaire, the local bread maker, is kindly putting me up in her shop. If you don't mind, you're welcome to come to my room. I'm afraid it's only an attic room, so it's a little small.
</line><line>Luke:
Really? I mean, are you sure that's okay? If they were to find us there, wouldn't that mean trouble for everyone at the shop?
</line><line>Espella:
Not at all! You shouldn't even think like that. After all, it was you two who rescued me in London, wasn't it? So if there's anything I can do... You must let me help in whatever way I can!
</line><line>Layton:
Espella... Thank you. Allow us to graciously accept your kind offer.
</line><line>Espella:
Okay! Let's make our way there, while keeping an eye out for those knights. The bakery is on the eastern side of town.

</line>







<line>Layton:
Stories about the witches are no doubt a source of considerable fear for the townsfolk. So why is it deemed necessary to keep such stories in the Great Archive?
</line><line>Espella:
They are an important source of information for the Inquisition. Their prime objective is to capture witches and protect the people of the town.
</line><line>Layton:
So you're saying that in order to fight the witches, it is essential to read about them and learn their ways?
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, that's right. Stories involving the witches are under the authority of the order of knights. And the order of knights was established to protect the town of Labyrinthia.
</line>
<center>The Storyteller, the order of knights and the Inquisition; they are the ones who govern this town. The entire fate of Labyrinthia is decided by the Creator...otherwise known as <textEffects>the Storyteller</textEffects>. ...That personage is the "weaver" of all life in Labyrinthia. Including the current horrifying story, involving the actions of a witch. It then falls to the <textEffects>order of knights</textEffects> to protect the townsfolk from such events. The knights not only protect the people, but also act as the Storyteller's guard. And finally...the <textEffects>Inquisition</textEffects> is responsible for trying the witches in the Witches' Court. ...That is the manner in which this town is managed and order is maintained.</center>
<line>
Layton:
Undoubtedly, it was the order of knights keeping peace during the parade we saw.
</line><line>Espella:
That's right. The Storyteller holds those parades from time to time. He gives the townsfolk the Story that will determine their fate from that time onwards. The Story this time involved a witch, which explains why the knights were on such high alert. I wonder what spells will be used this time... If only we could check in that book...
</line><line>Layton:
......! Just a moment, Espella. What was it that you just said? Do you mean to say that there is a <textEffects>book about magic</textEffects>?
</line><line>Espella:
Y-yes, there is...in the Great Archive. It describes all of the spells that provide the witches with their wicked power. It is a <textEffects>special book</textEffects>, used by the Knights of the Inquisition, to aid them in their investigations.
</line><line>Layton:
That's it! That must have been what Carmine was so interested in. He was investigating the witches' power. Of course, it's possible that he came upon a secret that he shouldn't have known...
</line><line>Luke:
And that's why the witches attacked him...?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Luke. That may well be the reason. The <textEffects>Story</textEffects>, so respected by the people, and the <textEffects>witches</textEffects> whom they fear... There could be a certain secret connecting these two in some way.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
Thank you, Espella. It seems we now know where to begin with our investigation.
</line><line>Espella:
So you'll be visiting the Great Archive?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, indeed. The book about magic that resides there, may well provide a valuable clue towards unravelling the mystery of Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Luke:
We'd better get going with our investigation straight away, right, Professor?!
</line><line>Layton:
Absolutely, Luke. We must solve this puzzle for Carmine's sake, as well as for our own.
</line><line>Espella:
Um...Mr Layton? ............ Please... Please take me along with you!
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm...I'm not sure that's wise. It might put you in more than a little trouble. It is likely that Carmine's investigations are what led to him being pursued by witches. And if that's the case, the path we tread may well be fraught with danger.
</line><line>Espella:
Even so... I really would like to help you. Talking with you both like this... I, too, have come to believe that there must be a secret to this town. I want to help you find the truth!
</line><line>Layton:
Well, Espella... I suppose that settles it. From here on in, let's all do our very best to solve this mystery together.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, together!
</line><line>Luke:
I'm the professor's apprentice, so if there's anything you need to know, just ask!
</line><line>Espella:
Ha ha, thank you, Luke. I'll be sure to do that!
</line><line>Layton:
Well then, without any further ado, let's follow in Carmine's footsteps and visit the Great Archive. I'm quite certain that's where the clues are waiting to be found.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, let's go!
</line><line>Eve:
Meeeow!
</line><line>Espella:
Not you, Eve...I'm afraid you'll have to stay here until I get back.
</line><line>Eve:
Meeeow?
</line><line>Espella:
Oh! My pendant. I almost forgot it.
</line><line>Layton:
That's a lovely pendant, Espella.
</line><line>Espella:
It's very old. I can't even remember how old I was when I started wearing it. Right. Sorry to have kept you. Shall we leave for the Great Archive now?

<line><i>Bakery</i>
</line><line>Patty:
Oh, Espella. Are you off out somewhere?
</line><line>Espella:
Yes. I'm taking Mr Layton and Luke to see the Great Archive.
</line><line>Patty:
Is that so? Well, you might want to hurry... it looks like it might rain at any time. Ah yes, that reminds me. Could you get me something while you're out? Just on your way back would be fine.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, of course. What can I get for you?
</line><line>Patty:
Some goat's milk from Mary. I forgot to get some when I was at the market.
</line><line>Espella:
Okay, I'll drop round to Mary's farm on the way back.
</line><line>Patty:
Would you? There's a milk bucket ready round the back.
</line><line>Luke:
Milk, you say?
</line><line>Espella:
Naturally, our bakery uses only the finest goat's milk for our milk loaf. It's so fluffy and white, it's delicious!
</line><line>Luke:
Cor...sounds great!
</line><line>Layton:
Let's be certain to try some later, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
I'm totally up for that!
</line>

<line>
Patty:
Well, I never! You've really solved it, haven't you?!
</line><line>Layton:
If you have a puzzle to be solved, you can always rely on us!
</line><line>Patty:
What a gentleman! I'll have to bake you something extra special later, to show my appreciation!
</line><line>Luke:
I'm already looking forward to it!

It looks like the knights have given up searching for us, thank goodness.

<line><i>Great Archive Entrance</i>
</line><line>Espella:
Here we are, this is the Great Archive.
</line><line>Luke:
Wow! It looked impressive even from a distance, but now we're here up close, it's huge! Just looking up at it makes my neck ache.
</line><line>Layton:
It must have taken considerable time and manpower to erect a building of this size.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, it did. This building has become something of a symbol for the town.
</line><line>Luke:
Huh? Hey, look at that roof over there... It looks like it's suffered considerable <textEffects>fire damage</textEffects> at some point. Was there a major fire or something?
</line><line>Espella:
Ah, that... That was...
</line><line>???:
I've been listening for a while, and must say, you two really are strange.
</line><line>Luke:
Oh, it's you.
</line><line>Petter:
That roof has been like that for some time. It's certainly nothing new.
</line><line>Luke:
R-really...?
</line><line>Layton:
If it's all right with you, could you tell us a little about it?
</line><line>Petter:
You two never cease to amaze me, with your incredible lack of knowledge. Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to tell you. That damage is from the <textEffects>Legendary Fire</textEffects>.
</line><line>Layton:
The Legendary Fire?
</line><line>Petter:
Yes. Long, long ago, there was a huge fire that engulfed almost this entire town. The damage there occurred at that time. You can see other traces of the fire around the town too, here and there.
</line><line>Luke:
The entire town was engulfed in a huge fire?
</line><line>Petter:
All of the townsfolk know about it. You're probably the only ones that don't.
</line><line>Layton:
Thank you for filling us in. That's certainly cleared up a few things.
</line><line>Petter:
No problem. It so happens I had nothing better to do. It wasn't such a bad way to kill time. Anyway, I'll see you around...
</line><line>Luke:
To think that even a building this size could be affected by fire... The fire that spread through the town really must have been "legendary"...
</line><line>Layton:
You're certainly right about that, Luke.
</line><line>Espella:
............

Wow! There are books crammed in here from floor to ceiling!
</line><line>Layton:
Truly remarkable... Are all of these books "stories"?
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, they are...all of them. It's said that these were all written by the Storyteller.
</line><line>Luke:
All of these books? But there are so many!
</line><line>???:

</line>
<center>I've got 'em, don't worry. P-p-piece of caaake! Phew...told you! No problem.</center>
<line>Sorry to startle you folk. I didn't think there was anyone here.
</line><line>Layton:
That's all right. It's lucky that you didn't drop any books.
</line><line>Luke:
I don't think I've ever seen anyone carry so many books at once. Aren't they heavy?
</line><line>Dewey:
I love books, so I feel like a mother carrying her baby. If you love books too, why not carry a few with me?
</line><line>Luke:
I do love books, but I don't think I could carry that many...
</line><line>Dewey:
You obviously don't understand the true enjoyment of books. Embracing books, being buried in books, the feel of books, the smell of books... Listening to the sound of the pages turning, gazing up at books piled high... Being surrounded by books and playing with them... That's how to enjoy books!
</line><line>Luke:
I'm not sure I totally agree...
</line><line>Espella:
Um...Dewey?
</line><line>Dewey:
Eh?! Th-that voice... That's Espella, isn't it? Uh-oh! H-here we go again!
</line><line>Layton:
Please, remain calm. You wouldn't want to drop those books.
</line><line>Dewey:
Just leave it...to me! See, all under control.
</line><line>Espella:
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you like that. Dewey, we've come here to find a book about magic.
</line><line>Dewey:
M-magic?! I should have known... That is, I, uh...never mind.
</line><line>Layton:
............?
</line><line>Dewey:
Well, if it's magic that you're interested in, then might I suggest the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects>?
</line><line>Layton:
The Grand Grimoire, you say? We'd like to borrow that book, if we may.
</line><line>Dewey:
Well, you'll need Miss Mystere's permission. Are you sure you want to borrow it...?
</line><line>Luke:
Absolutely! We're very interested in magic.
</line><line>Dewey:
Friends of Espella's...interested in magic...? So these two must also be... Uh-oh...whoops! Nooo! I-I'm losing them!

<line>Ridelle:
The Great Archive was founded for those in the noble pursuit of knowledge. I must ask you to be a little quieter, please. Dewey, as a budding librarian I would have thought that you would have known better...
</line><line>Dewey:
I'm sorry, Miss Mystere. But these people say they want to borrow the Grand Grimoire!
</line><line>Ridelle:
Did you say...the Grand Grimoire? .........! You're... ...Espella Cantabella. You of all people must know the significance of the Grand Grimoire. It is an important piece of literature which can only be viewed by learned persons of significant status. It's not like I can just give my permission to whoever asks for it, you know.
</line><line>Espella:
I understand that, but this man...
</line><line>Ridelle:
I'm sorry, but rules cannot be changed.
</line><line>Layton:
The request is all mine. That book could prove indispensable for my investigations into magic.
</line><line>Ridelle:
And you are...? Excuse me, but may I ask your name?
</line><line>Layton:
I'm Hershel Layton. I'm investigating this town... You could say I'm a traveller, so to speak.
</line><line>Ridelle:
A traveller? I'm afraid I have never come across such a profession... Well, I suppose we can return to that later. My name is Ridelle Mystere. I am a librarian, as well as curator of the Great Archive. And I am therefore responsible for all pieces of work here, including the Grand Grimoire. I'm afraid that no matter what your profession or who you are, it is beyond my authority to lend you the Grand Grimoire... It is simply against the rules.
</line><line>Luke:
The rules...? Can't you make an exception for us?
</line><line>Layton:
Luke...please, leave this to me. I can understand that you are unable to show this book to just anyone. However, as you yourself said just a moment ago, the Great Archive was founded for those in the noble pursuit of knowledge. And I am currently very much in the pursuit of knowledge regarding magic. Perhaps you would consider letting me at least peruse the Grand Grimoire?
</line><line>Ridelle:
Only learned persons of significant status, and in particular, inquisitors, are permitted to refer to the Grand Grimoire.
</line><line>Layton:
Inquisitors...?
</line><line>Ridelle:
Those who administer justice in this town. Knights of wisdom, as they are known. Only somebody with equal status to that of an inquisitor, or with the same level of wisdom, would qualify.
</line><line>Layton:
So if I could demonstrate the required level of wisdom, then I would qualify?
</line><line>Ridelle:
You certainly are a persistent gentleman. Very well, let's see what you make of a trial. This trial has been used in the past to test the ability of aspiring inquisitors. If you are able to clear this trial, then I will acknowledge that your wisdom matches that of an inquisitor. If you can achieve this, then as curator of the Great Archive, I will lend you that book.
</line><line>Layton:
Splendid! Then by all means, do begin.
</line><line>Ridelle:
You certainly have some confidence. Let's see if you can live up to it. Do you think you can pass this trial, at which so many hopefuls have stumbled? See what you can do with this!
</line>

<line>
Ridelle:
............! How can this be? That hardly seemed a challenge for you. Who are you...and how did you do that so effortlessly?
</line><line>Layton:
More importantly than who I am, there is one thing of which I am certain, and that is that every puzzle has an answer. So do I qualify?
</line><line>Ridelle:
............ Not so fast! Do you really believe that my permission can be obtained as easily as that? That was no more than a preliminary trial, to separate the wheat from the chaff. Now for the real trial. Even a man of your calibre should find this challenging. This trial will have your eyes rolling and your head spinning!
</line><line>Layton:
............!
</line><line>Dewey:
Miss Mystere, I've never seen you get this excited!
</line><line>Ridelle:
Silence! Be quiet, Dewey!
</line><line>Dewey:
...Sorry!
</line><line>Layton:
I assume it's safe to predict that this will not be quite so simple...
</line><line>Ridelle:
</line>
<center>Ahem! This will put an end to that overconfidence! Prepare to lose your mind in this mind-bending puzzle!</center>
<line>
</line>

<line>
Ridelle:
H...h...how...? My mind-bending puzzle! You didn't lose your mind...on the contrary, you found the solution! It's...that's...just impossible! Oh! My glasses! My book! Don't...look... Don't look at me! My glasses, let me put them on... Just a mo...ment!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ridelle:
That's better. I apologise...for a moment there, I lost my composure. But to see my trial cleared like that... It seems I underestimated you, sir.
</line><line>Layton:
It was a fascinating puzzle. No more than I'd expect from the curator of the Great Archive.
</line><line>Ridelle:
I find your confidence rather disconcerting... I hope someday to have the pleasure of showing you a puzzle that will make those little round eyes of yours spin in your head! But nevertheless, a promise is a promise. I hereby grant you your permission. The <textEffects>special viewing room</textEffects> containing the Grand Grimoire is located on the first floor. As I'm sure you are already aware, that book is of unparalleled importance. By no means may it be treated with anything but the utmost care.
</line><line>Layton:
Of course, Miss Mystere. Thank you for granting me permission.
</line><line>Ridelle:
Well then, shall we proceed to the special viewing room? I shall have to accompany you, since the room is locked.
</line><line>Luke:
You did it, Professor! You cleared both trials in one fell swoop!
</line><line>Espella:
That was amazing, Mr Layton! It's well known that Miss Mystere is an avid collector of puzzles. And I've heard that the puzzles she presents are always very difficult to solve!
</line><line>Layton:
I see...so there are collectors of puzzles in this place, too...
</line><line>Espella:
......? What do you mean?
</line><line>Layton:
Oh, nothing important. Right then, no use in waiting around. Let's go and take a look at the Grand Grimoire!

Right you are, Professor!

This is the special viewing room. I'm sure a gentleman such as yourself will understand... but seeing as this is a special room not open to the general public, I must insist that you all be on your best behaviour.
</line><line>Luke:
Wow...this room feels so grand and elegant.
</line><line>Espella:
It's my first time in here too... I must admit, I feel a little nervous.
</line><line>Layton:
It certainly does give some indication of the importance of the book being kept here. That book in the centre must be the Grand Grimoire.

<line>Luke:
This is incredible! It's crammed with information about magic.
</line><line>Espella:
People say it's the magic used by the witches.
</line><line>Luke:
If that's so, then the magic we saw in London must be in here somewhere too.
</line><line>Layton:
That may well be true, Luke. A tome as thick as this must surely contain such information.
</line><line>Luke:
Finding it is a bit daunting, though... Huh, what's this? Professor, this page is different from the others...
</line><line>Layton:
What is this...?
</line><line>Luke:
This page isn't about magic at all... Something about it makes me feel uneasy.
</line><line>Layton:
............! Luke, this page...it appears to be addressed to someone, don't you think?
</line><line>Luke:
Oh... You mean like a message...? Let's read it, Professor!
</line>
<center>From a time long ago, The ancient flame has been locked, In an infinite vault of books.Waiting for the awakening, When the sun and moon, Watching over the sage, Swap places to show their true form,The door to the past will open. Once a person of perspicacity has fulfilled the challenge, The door will be open. Until then I will wait, For the time of the awakening.</center>
<hr />
<line>Luke:
Wh-what is this?!
</line><line>Ridelle:
How...can this be? Why is this in here...? How did something like this get into the Grand Grimoire?! It's just not possible... I can't understand it. No one entered the special viewing room before you came here... And whenever someone enters this room, I always accompany them in this way.
</line><line>Espella:
So...that means that the page must have changed at some point...doesn't it?
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Luke:
Could that really be possible?! Perhaps with some kind of device...
</line><line>Ridelle:
Unthinkable! There is only one key to this room, so no one can enter without being granted my permission. I assure you it's true, on my honour as a curator.
</line><line>Luke:
But then...how can anyone have done this?
</line><line>Layton:
Luke, I believe we both know who might be capable of such an act.
</line><line>Luke:
Eh...?
</line><line>Espella:
You mean, witches...don't you?
</line><line>Luke:
W-witches...
</line><line>Layton:
............ We don't know yet who changed that page, but the more important matter... is what's written here. The "infinite vault of books" mentioned here presumably refers to the Great Archive. Which implies there is a secret of some sort hidden within the library.
</line><line>Luke:
Professor, what about this part: "a person of pers, perspi...perspicacity"...?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, I believe that could be referring to Carmine.
</line><line>Espella:
He came here regularly to investigate.
</line><line>Layton:
So it's certainly somewhat likely. Which means our next objective... is to find the answer that he was looking for.
</line><line>Luke:
It's a bit of a spooky message... But if we can open this "door to the past", then we'll surely be one step closer to solving this mystery!
</line><line>Ridelle:
Just a moment, please... I'm the curator here. And I won't be allowing you to investigate anything without my permission.
</line><line>Luke:
S-so you mean we can't investigate...?
</line><line>Ridelle:
Not at all. I'm simply insisting that you allow me to accompany you. There should be no doors in this library that I don't know about. And even if there is something hidden somewhere, as suggested by this message, it is my duty as curator to know what that is.
</line><line>Layton:
I completely understand, Miss Mystere. We can only benefit from your presence. Now then, how about we all make our way back to the entrance? Let's think about where this door could be from there.
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>Great Archive</i>
</line><line>Luke:
But, Professor, supposing there is a door, that message is such a puzzle in itself... don't you think it'll be difficult to find?
</line><line>Espella:
You may be right. And this library is so large... Finding anything will surely take a good deal of our time.
</line><line>Layton:
No, I think not. You're both missing something here. I believe I may well know what is meant by the words in the message.
</line><line>Luke:
Eh? Really, Professor?!
</line><line>Layton:
Yes. If you'll just remember the wording...
</line>
<center>"From a time long ago, The ancient flame has been locked, In an infinite vault of books,Waiting for the awakening.

Layton:
If you'll both take a look around this room, you'll notice we are surrounded by books. There is probably nowhere else in the library with more books than there are right here.
</line><line>Luke:
There are books extending all the way up. We're completely surrounded by them.
</line><line>Layton:
And the key to opening this door is in the "<textEffects>sun and moon watching over the sage</textEffects>".
</line><line>Luke:
But what could that mean...?
</line><line>Espella:
There are no windows, so no light can come in from the sun or the moon.
</line><line>Layton:
Precisely! Which means it is not the real sun and moon that are being referred to here. And they are located where they can "<textEffects>watch over</textEffects>" the sage. In other words, behind. Perhaps you have already realised to whom "the sage" is referring...? Right then, let's find this "sun and moon watching over the sage" and open the door!
</line>






</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Luke:
Ah! What's that...?!
</line><line>Espella:
It's a sun and moon construction... Oh!
</line><line>Luke:
So the "<textEffects>sage</textEffects>" must be...
</line><line>Layton:
That's right, the sage of this library refers to the <textEffects>curator</textEffects>. And this sun and moon construction is located right behind her seat... So that's what the "sun and moon watching over the sage" was referring to.
</line><line>Luke:
And when the sun and moon swap places, their true form will be shown... and the door to the past will open. So all we need to do is work out what that means...
</line><line>Espella:
But what does it mean by "their true form"?
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm...well, if we interpret it at face value, it would suggest that we are currently seeing their <textEffects>untrue form</textEffects>. ............Hmm? Have a look at this. There seems to be some sort of mechanism in place.
</line><line>Luke:
Ah! Professor! If you look closely, there seems to be a puzzle hidden here.
</line>

<hr />
<line>Luke:
Ah! Professor, there's a stairway!
</line><line>Espella:
Who would have thought there could be anything like this hidden here?
</line><line>Layton:
"<textEffects>The ancient flame has been locked in an infinite vault of books</textEffects>"... I wonder just what we'll find down there...
</line><line>Ridelle:
A-an entrance...to a basement below the Great Archive?!
</line><line>Layton:
Am I right in thinking that you knew nothing of this stairway's existence?
</line><line>Ridelle:
That's right... And if I, the curator, knew nothing of it, then surely no one else could. It's hard to believe that a secret such as this could have been hidden here all this time. Who could have possibly left such a message...?
</line><line>Layton:
............ Hmm...it might be wise not to let anyone see what has been revealed here...
</line><line>Ridelle:
I agree. I'll be back as soon as I have asked the other visitors to leave the building.

The reason for all of Labyrinthia's suffering at the hands of witches, lies in the very existence of the Great Witch Bezella.
</line><line>Layton:
Would you mind elaborating...?
</line><line>Ridelle:
The Great Witch Bezella is the source of all the other witches. As long as she exists, there will be no end to other witches. While the Great Witch Bezella is with us, the townspeople will forever live in fear under the shadow of witches.
</line><line>Luke:
So you mean that if there were no Great Witch, there would be peace?
</line><line>Ridelle:
No Great Witch? That's easy enough to say... But while all of the knights have been searching for Bezella, nobody has ever been able to find her. There are very few clues, and no one has ever seen her in person. Nevertheless, the Great Witch Bezella is <textEffects>undoubtedly present</textEffects> in Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Layton:
How can you be so certain?
</line><line>Ridelle:
Because her deep <textEffects>claw marks</textEffects> can still be seen throughout the town.
</line><line>Luke:
"Claw marks"...?
</line><line>Ridelle:
You must all have seen them too. The <textEffects>traces of that fire</textEffects>, when you entered this library.
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, yes. There was a part of this building that had suffered noticeable damage.
</line><line>Ridelle:
Bezella is a fearful witch, who has all other witches doing her bidding. Long ago...this town was <textEffects>reduced to ashes</textEffects> as a result of her fiery magic.
</line><line>Luke:
Reduced...to ashes?
</line><line>Ridelle:
That must have been...let me see...a hundred or so years ago. It was on the evening of the <textEffects>fire festival</textEffects>, held every year in honour of the Great Witch Bezella. The Great Witch's fury was unleashed without warning, as the entire town burned.
</line><line>Layton:
That's terrible...
</line><line>Ridelle:
That was the <textEffects>Legendary Fire</textEffects>... Every person in this town knows about it.
</line><line>Layton:
The Legendary Fire...
</line><line>Ridelle:
The rebuilding of the town was a long and arduous process. And all the while, Bezella must have been watching and laughing from the shadows.
</line><line>Luke:
That's awful...
</line><line>Ridelle:
Even now, the legend of long ago... continues to cause real suffering amongst the townsfolk. To think that a painting of that fearful witch could be right here in the basement of my beloved library! What is it doing here, of all places?!
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Ridelle:
There's nothing for it...I'll just have to have this room sealed shut. Please, let's keep the existence of this room strictly between ourselves. For the good of the people. As for me, I shall do my best to forget all about this hidden room... ...I'm afraid I'd rather not remain in here a minute longer. ...It's time I started closing up the library for the day.
</line><line>Luke:
I can't help but feel we've done something wrong.
</line><line>Layton:
Luke...do you recall the words towards the end of that message?
</line><line>Luke:
Do you mean "<textEffects>until then I will wait</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Layton:
That's right. When we opened this door... or rather, when we were guided towards opening this door, I could sense someone else's will at work. It's almost as if our following Carmine and coming to this library, had all been planned out in advance.
</line><line>Luke:
Surely you don't mean...that we were beckoned here by the Great Witch Bezella?!

</line><line>Luke:
The atmosphere is a bit sinister. Not to mention that scary picture... Maybe it's about time we made a move from here?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, indeed. ............ Those words at the end of the message... ............"I will wait"............ What if...we weren't meant to be the ones being called here...?

</line><line>Luke:
Phew, it's much more relaxing here, isn't it? It felt so intense and claustrophobic down there.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, it certainly did... Today has been full of surprises. Not only did I meet up with you two again, but we also found that mural in the library. It seems that this town really does hold a mysterious secret, doesn't it? What shall we do now?
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm...I'd certainly like to learn more about this magic. We've been in here for quite some time. It must be getting late. It's probably best if we wind up our investigating for today and take a rest. You must both be feeling tired.
</line><line>Espella:
Yes, I suppose you're right. I'd be happy to do a little more investigating with you two, but I have an errand to run before it gets too late.
</line><line>Luke:
I'm still up for investigating further! Whatever the puzzle, I'm ready to solve it!
</line><line>Espella:
Ha ha! Luke, I could hear your tummy rumbling from here just now!
</line><line>Luke:
Well, I can't pretend I'm not a little hungry...
</line><line>Espella:
If you haven't arranged accommodation yet, why don't you both stay at the bakery? There is a room free, so I'm sure it'd be all right. And Mrs Eclaire would love to have you. What do you say...?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, if you put it like that, we'd be delighted to stay. Thank you, Espella.
</line><line>Luke:
And there's all that delicious bread, too! Mmmm, I'm looking forward to it already!
</line><line>Ridelle:
Professor Layton, do you have to be going?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes. Sorry for all the trouble we put you to.
</line><line>Ridelle:
Not at all. Although I still can't get used to there being a secret room under the library. It's been a while since I last met someone capable of solving my puzzles. And as I promised, you have my permission to borrow the Grand Grimoire. If you have any need for it in the future, please do drop by and let me know.
</line><line>Layton:
Thank you very much, Miss Mystere. It's been a pleasure.
</line><line>Ridelle:
Oh...there is just one more thing. I have all of Labyrinthia's puzzles stored here in this library. As you continue with your investigations here in Labyrinthia, there will likely be puzzles that you cannot solve or which you do not find. Such puzzles will come to me. Any time you wish to solve such puzzles, just visit me and I will show them to you.
</line><line>Layton:
Puzzles that we cannot solve or do not find, you say? Very well. Then I look forward to seeing you again.
</line><line>Ridelle:
I'll be waiting. Please take care on your way home. It's already become dark out there. And...if I remember rightly, the Storyteller's latest story did mention the evening...
</line><line>Layton:
............ You take care, too. Until we meet again, Miss Mystere.

</line><line>Luke:
Wow! It's already this dark out here... I didn't realise we were in there so long.
</line><line>Layton:
It looks as if it must have been raining up until a moment ago. The ground is still wet.
</line><line>Luke:
Yes, and that reminds me of what Mrs Eclaire was saying before we left... She said: "you might want to hurry... it looks like it might rain at any time." Let's get a move on! You too, Espella...... Hey, where is she?
</line><line>Layton:
That's strange...she's not here.
</line><line>Luke:
I wonder where she could have gone...
</line><line>Layton:
Perhaps she's still in the Great Archive...
</line><line>Dewey:
Slowly does it, step by step... Oh...are you two still here? Can you let me through? I have to lock up.
</line><line>Luke:
Hello, Dewey. Have you seen Espella?
</line><line>Dewey:
If you're looking for Espella, she left while you were still talking to Miss Mystere.
</line><line>Luke:
Eh? I wonder why...
</line><line>Dewey:
She said something about having to buy some milk. Even though it was still raining...
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, yes. I do remember Mrs Eclaire asking her to get some milk for the bakery.
</line><line>Luke:
It was raining...you said?
</line><line>Dewey:
Yes. It started raining about the time you all went down into that library basement. When Espella left just now, it did look as if the rain was about to stop. Ah, yes! She left a message for you. She said to go back without her.
</line><line>Luke:
But she didn't have to go alone! Especially in the dark...
</line><line>Dewey:
I'm sure she'll be fine. If it's only milk she needs, then she can get it at the market. It's not far, so she should be back soon. If anything, I'd be more worried about you two being the ones in danger. You, know, in the Story, it said there were "<textEffects>two companions</textEffects>".
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Dewey:
If your work here is finished, then I suggest you both go home. I don't want to get caught up in anything!
</line><line>Layton:
Luke...why don't we head back to the bakery and wait for Espella there?
</line><line>Luke:
I suppose so. I guess she'll be all right...right?

</line><line>Patty:
Aha, welcome back! I've prepared the evening meal already.
</line><line>Luke:
Wow, it looks great!
</line><line>Maya:
Hang on...where's Espella?
</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid we were separated when she went to get that milk. Has she not come back yet?
</line><line>Patty:
Oh, dear. Maybe I was asking too much of her...
</line><line>Layton:
My apologies. I should have stopped her, had I had the chance.
</line><line>Patty:
It's nothing you need to worry about, Mr Layton! That girl knows her way around. I'm sure she'll be back soon. Let's go ahead and eat while waiting for her.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
I love it when we all get to eat together. Meals are much more enjoyable that way!
</line><line>Luke:
I've never had bread and jam that tasted this good before!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I hope Espella gets back soon...
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, yeah! You guys went out to the Great Archive with her, didn't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Did you find what you were looking for?
</line><line>Layton:
Well...it's a bit of a mystery, really.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Layton:
In truth, we went there to investigate the mystery that is Labyrinthia. However, what we found instead was quite the puzzle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right... A "puzzle", huh...
</line><line>Maya:
You know, I get the impression puzzles are pretty popular in this town. Do you not know what a puzzle is, Nick?! Not that I know exactly...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we spend all our time baking... It's not really the kind of thing we're supposed to know about, I guess.
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, it appears the two of you are a little unsure about the concept of puzzles.
</line><line>Maya:
Say, Mr Layton... Do you think you could give us a little "Puzzles 101" crash course? I'm kinda curious.
</line><line>Layton:
It would be my pleasure, Miss Fey. But rather than explaining it in words, I believe actually trying your hand at a puzzle would be far more rewarding. Here, I'll give you both a simple example to think about. Now then, here we have two long loaves of bread placed side by side. You'll notice that they form the <textEffects>number 11</textEffects>. Do you see what I mean?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, yeah... I get it! So that's what a puzzle is!
</line><line>Layton:
Not quite, Miss Fey. The puzzle is what follows next. What I'd like you to try is... I'd like you to see if you can change this into a number <textEffects>lower</textEffects> than 11.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A lower number...? So how about if I take one of the loaves?
</line><line>Layton:
However, the one condition is that you must <textEffects>add</textEffects> another loaf of exactly the same type.
</line><line>Maya:
You need to add... another loaf?! Even though we add a loaf, the number has to be lower... I think I'm beginning to see what you mean by "puzzle"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Wait, I think I've got it! I may just be a baker, but I bet I have the right answer! If I place the extra loaf sideways like this, then one minus one equals <textEffects>zero</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh gimme a break, Nick! That's totally the letter <textEffects>H</textEffects>. We're trying to solve a puzzle here, not win a spelling bee!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, c'mon...I can't be the ONLY one that sees one minus one, right? ...Right?
</line><line>Layton:
Turning it into a matter of arithmetic is certainly an interesting approach.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You, uhhh...think so?
</line><line>Layton:
Most certainly. That's precisely the kind of flexible thinking needed for solving puzzles. Now, let's think again.
</line><line>Maya:
Take a seat and leave this to a pro, Nick. How about...this?! You just take this new loaf and...TA-DA! Now THAT's one minus one!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! Eating is cheating!
</line><line>Maya:
Really? Because it feels more like winning to me.
</line><line>Layton:
You're full of surprises, Miss Fey. I didn't expect that kind of innovation.
</line><line>Maya:
I solved the puzzle AND enjoyed the bread! Win-win, baby!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... didn't Mr Layton tell us at the start that we need to add another loaf of the <textEffects>exact same type</textEffects>?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? Seriously?
</line><line>Layton:
That's right, unfortunately. I'm afraid I can't accept this as a solution to the puzzle.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, all right, but... Is there really another better solution?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, what do you think? Can either of you think of a different solution?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm drawing a blank... I guess this kind of thing just isn't for me.
</line><line>Layton:
You both came up with such creative answers, I'm sure you'll be solving puzzles in no time. But now, it's time for the solution. The important thing in this puzzle's solution, is <textEffects>the angle</textEffects> of the loaf that is added. If the new loaf is placed upright, like so...
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, I get it! It's the number <textEffects>1.1</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, that's right! That's a lot lower than eleven...
</line><line>Layton:
Exactly. When solving puzzles, there is never just one correct method. It's essential to think flexibly and try many means to solve it. Sometimes critical thinking is the key to success.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Right. I see what you mean. These puzzles are really something else.
</line><line>Maya:
Well...if I see another puzzle like this, I'd still rather <textEffects>eat</textEffects> my way to the solution...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... You know, I don't think I'm cut out for brain-busting bread puzzles like this. I'll stick with good ol' regular bread, thanks.
</line><line>Maya:
That's because we're ace bakers! I guess we're better suited to using our hands than our heads...
</line><line>Layton:
Is that so? In truth, I can't help but feel you're both a little out of place as bakers, if you'll pardon my saying so. Naturally, I won't force puzzles upon you, but if either of you should be interested, I would heartily recommend giving puzzle solving a try.
</line><line>Luke:
Professor, right now there's something else we all need to try... Mrs Eclaire's freshly baked bread is getting cold! And I'm sure it tastes better hot!
</line><line>Layton:
Oh dear, so it is. You know how I can get when it comes to puzzles...
</line>

<line>Patty:
Well, young man, I must say it's a pleasure to have someone show such appreciation for my baking.
</line><line>Luke:

</line><line>Patty:

</line><line>Luke:

</line><line>Captain:

</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Captain:
Well, it should be quite obvious. You're coming to the court, of course!

</line><line>Luke:
Whaaaaaa?! Mr Wright, what did you do?!
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, Nick! What did you do?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I didn't do anything! The only thing you could accuse me of is making bread that's TOO good to eat!
</line><line>Captain:
Ahem! This man is not the one who's on trial.
</line><line>Layton:
In that case, why is Mr Wright being made to go to the court?
</line><line>Captain:
That's simple! Because the girl has requested him, of course!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Girl...? What girl?!
</line><line>Captain:
Naturally, the girl facing trial for this evening's crime... That heinous witch... Miss <textEffects>Espella Cantabella</textEffects>, no less!
