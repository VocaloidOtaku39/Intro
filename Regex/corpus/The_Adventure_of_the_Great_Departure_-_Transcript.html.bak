<title>The Adventure of the Great Departure</title>

???:
</line>
<center><textEffects>(I still can't believe it. I still can't believe this is happening. How can it be that just beyond the doors to this quiet little chamber... ...is the highest court in Japan, waiting to decide my <span style="color:#E16935">fate</textEffects>?)</span></center>
<line>
Bailiff:
What?
</line><line>???:
Oh! No, nothing...
</line><line>Bailiff:
Save your glares... <textEffects>murderer</textEffects>!
</line><line>???:
......... Sorry...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>. I'm a second-year student at the Imperial Yumei University. Three days ago, I somehow found myself in the middle of a horrifying incident. And now here I am, awaiting my <textEffects>trial</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>???:
That's enough! He's not obliged to listen to such abuse, Officer.
</line><line>Bailiff:
And who are YOU?!
</line><line>???:
I'm this man's <textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>. I'll be defending him today.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Lawyer?
</line><line>???:
Yes. And until the judge has given his verdict on the case... ...no one has the right to treat him as a criminal. So you will hold your tongue!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Tsk! Technicalities! Look at you, you haven't even graduated yet!
</line><line>???:
And yet, I still seem to know better than you how a court officer should behave. Right, Ryunosuke?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Y-Yes, of course! Sorry!
</line><line>???:
......... What are you apologising to me for?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I... No, I suppose that wasn't my fault. ......... But really, <textEffects>Kazuma</textEffects>, I never meant to drag you into this. I'm sorry...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ha ha ha hah! There you go again, apologising! Just like always.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Though I must say, you've been all over the newspapers these past few days. 'Yumei University Professor Murdered in Cold Blood by Student!' But obviously...you didn't actually do it, did you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Of course not! You have to believe me! I didn't do it! I... I could never <textEffects>murder</textEffects> someone...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Then there's nothing to worry about. Straighten yourself up. Hold your head high.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You mean...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
I believe you. I know you're innocent, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>Kazuma Asogi</textEffects>, my best friend. Also in his second year at Yumei University. But he's far more clever than I. A star student, in fact. He's even a qualified <textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>. Impressive, considering he's still an undergraduate.
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's not that impressive. The very concept of lawyers is only a few years old. Here in Japan, anyway. My qualifications don't mean much. Yet.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You said exactly the same thing three days ago. But I'm proud to have a friend like you, Kazuma. Truly. <textEffects>(Three days ago... Yes, that's when <span style="color:#E16935">all this</textEffects> started...)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Congratulations, Kazuma! It looks like you're going to get to study abroad at last!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I know! I've been forever dreaming of this day. Finally, those government elites have acknowledged my academic achievements and successes in court.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you'll be representing Japan as you immerse yourself in the most sophisticated legal system in the world! I'm really happy for you. And proud, as your friend. <textEffects>(There's not a soul in the university who doesn't know Kazuma's name. He's a living legend! It's like there's some mysterious aura billowing around his temple.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
I want to bring about change in our own legal system. That's why I have to cross the ocean to see the real thing with my own eyes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The heart of <textEffects>the British Empire</textEffects>... I wish I could see it, too.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Then come with me! We'd have a wild time tearing up the streets of Her Majesty's City of London together!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If only it were that simple...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a while longer.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It was straight after that. That's when it happened...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
Asogi. May I have a word?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Professor! I didn't know you were coming. 
</line><line>???:
Well, this case has personal significance to me. But never mind that for now. Asogi... You should go immediately to the judge's chambers.
</line><line>Kazuma:
To His Excellency's chambers? Why?
</line><line>???:
He was looking for you before. You advocating for the defence in this trial was a sudden decision. It seems there may be some confusion about procedures today as a result. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Who is this man? I feel as though I've seen him at university before...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
I see. I'll go at once then. 
</line><line>???:
I shall accompany you.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Alright then, Ryunosuke. I'll see you in the courtroom. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Thanks, Kazuma. .........
</line><line>???:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(Ugh, this is awkward...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
If I may...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, sorry?
</line><line>???:
You must be the defendant. Ryunosuke Naruhodo, I believe?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! Yes, that's right!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
My name is <textEffects>Yujin Mikotoba</textEffects>. I'm a professor of forensic medicine at Yumei University.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, Professor Mikotoba... <textEffects>(I've heard that name from Kazuma before. As I recall, he's been pushing to get the government to agree to Kazuma studying abroad.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Asogi has told me about you. You and he are <textEffects>best friends</textEffects>, I understand.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
As such, I feel you should know...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Know what?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, as you've no doubt heard, Asogi has been granted permission to go and study in Great Britain. However... If he should fail to defend you in today's trial... ...I'm afraid that that permission will be <textEffects>revoked</textEffects>...and never granted again.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Ah, as I suspected... You were unaware of this. I had a feeling Asogi may have chosen not to tell you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(He's agreed to defend me, knowing that if he fails, his dreams will be shattered?)</textEffects> But I don't understand! Why would the government do such a thing?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
The administration has to choose from a large number of applicants for overseas study. It's very difficult to persuade them to grant permission, even in the most favourable of circumstances.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't believe it... ......... But I... I didn't do it! I swear it! I'm not a murderer...
</line><line>Mikotoba:
I'm sure that's true. Nevertheless... I can assure you that proving your innocence will be no easy task. You see, there are certain...'<textEffects>peculiarities</textEffects>' about today's trial.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
You'll soon understand, once proceedings get underway.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! But... Then what should I do?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well... Naturally I'm not going to suggest doing anything that could lead to a conviction.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right, so...
</line><line>Mikotoba:
As soon as the trial starts... ...the judge will pose a certain <textEffects>question</textEffects> to the defence. When that happens, you must answer before anyone else. You must say, '<textEffects>I do</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
'I do'...? But, what will the question be? Surely...not...? 'Do you accept the accusations brought before you?'...
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Of course not.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Defendant! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Ah, it would seem our surreptitious discussions are to be cut short. So allow me to summarise... Kazuma Asogi must not be the defence lawyer in this trial. Of course, as the defendant, the final decision is yours.
</line><line>Bailiff:
What are you waiting for? Do you want to be found guilty for failing to appear?! Get moving! There's no point in anyone advocating for the likes of you anyway!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This is it... If this trial goes badly... ...Kazuma's dreams of studying abroad are over. And what's more... ...I'll be found <textEffects>guilty</textEffects>...of <textEffects>murder</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<center>And so... ...with absolutely no idea of what lay ahead, I embarked on that unforgettable trial. My one and only chance of proving my innocence, the trial that would decide my <textEffects>destiny</textEffects>!</center>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>22nd November, 9:00 a.m.
Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2</textEffects></center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
So this... is a courtroom... 
</line><line>Kazuma:
<textEffects>The Supreme Court of Judicature</textEffects>. No court in the land has more power. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't much like the look of those people sitting in the public gallery. <textEffects>(Lots of military and other uniforms in there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
The powers that be have demanded that this be <textEffects>a secret trial</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A secret trial?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A trial that's closed to ordinary members of the public. Only military and government officials may attend. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? But why?
</line><line>Kazuma:
It'll become clear in time. But for now... ...you need to concentrate, Ryunosuke. It's about to begin.
</line><line>Judge:
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</line><line>Auchi:
The prosecution is ready, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Kazuma:
As is the defence.
</line><line>Judge:
Before we begin, there is one point of order I would like to confirm. Yesterday evening, the defence made a last-minute request for a change of advocate.
</line><line>Kazuma:
That's correct, Your Excellency. I made the request myself.
</line><line>Judge:
Normal procedure is for the defendant's advocacy to be decided two days prior to trial. As this is an unusual circumstance, I am obliged to ask for final confirmation now. Who advocates for the defendant in this trial?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is it! This must be <span style="color:#E16935">the question</textEffects>! Who's going to defend me? That's the question the professor meant. But then, if I say, '<textEffects>I do</textEffects>'... ......... I need to answer quickly! What should I do?)</span>
</line>


<line>Kazuma:
Your Excellency, no confirmation is needed. As I'm standing here beside the defendant, I hope it's clear who will advocate for his defence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Judge:
What is the meaning of this unruly outburst? 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I would like to inform the court that, that... ...I, <textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>, will be defending myself! 
</line><line>Judge:
You'll be... WHAAAT?! 
</line><line>Kazuma:
What are you playing at, Ryunosuke!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba told me everything. Just now, before the trial.
</line><line>Kazuma:
He did what?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He said that your dreams of studying abroad would be dashed if you were to lose.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... How sad. It means you don't have faith in me. You think I won't be able to get you off.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! It's not that, really! It's just that... Well, on the off-chance that things don't go well for me, I couldn't bear to be the reason that you...
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... Yes. I knew that's how you'd feel. Which is exactly why I decided not to tell you. Tsk! Professor Mikotoba shouldn't have stuck his nose in.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court hereby recognises the defendant's desire to advocate for himself in today's trial.
</line><line>Auchi:
Well, well... Does the accused admit defeat already? Renouncing his own counsel! Really!
</line><line>Kazuma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Make no mistake, Counsel... This merely shows that the defendant's innocence is so apparent, he's confident he can speak for himself. Isn't that so, Naruhodo-san?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...Oh! Yes, exactly! <textEffects>(Exactly what I WASN'T thinking! I'm not confident at all. In fact, my mind's a complete blank...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
I realize you're in charge now, but still... Try not to look so bewildered.
</line><line>Auchi:
Hmph. Well, for a mere university student to be brought before the Supreme Court... ...you must have perpetrated a most heinous crime indeed.
</line><line>Judge:
As you are no doubt aware, this is the Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. Accordingly, the very highest standards of conduct are expected of all present. Do I make myself clear, Defendant Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! ...Your Excellency!
</line><line>Judge:
It is therefore my duty to assess your <textEffects>competence</textEffects> for the task you have undertaken. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My competence? <textEffects>(What does that mean?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
He's questioning your ability to do the job.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well, he can't be questioning it more than I am!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So, let's start with the very simplest of questions.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... Yes!
</line><line>Judge:
Kindly state before the court the name of <textEffects>the victim</textEffects> in this case.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well that's easy enough. I've heard his name more times than I'd care to remember. But... Wait. Ugh, I'm so nervous, I can't even remember that! What was it again?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... Let me guess. Your mind's gone blank?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm... <textEffects>(You know me so well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
All the relevant information for this case can be found in <textEffects>the Court Record</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But, but I can't even find that...
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's simple. You can access the <textEffects><b>Court Record</b></textEffects> with a press of [R / E]. If you ever find you've forgotten something, just consult that. It's all in there.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I just have to press [R / E] for the <span style="color:olive"><b>Court Record</b></textEffects>? Alright, there's no time to lose!)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
This is the list of evidence you've collected. Now try switching to '<textEffects><b>People</b></textEffects>' instead with [R / RB / E]. You'll find details about the victim in here. When you're done, just press [B / Z] to go <textEffects><b>back</b></textEffects>. So remember, everything to do with the current case can be found in the <textEffects><b>Court Record</b></textEffects>. Now, you'd better not keep His Excellency waiting any longer. Go on. Find the victim in the 'People' section of the Court Record, then press [X / Y / R] to '<textEffects><b>Present</b></textEffects>'. Try it now.
</line>




<line>Ryunosuke:
The victim's name was <textEffects>Dr John H. Wilson</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsh huh huh... Well, at least you can remember the name of an esteemed member of your own university.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Dr Wilson was a visiting professor from England, invited to Yumei University three years ago.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. Which is the reason why this case has such profound <textEffects>implications</textEffects>. <textEffects>The British Empire</textEffects>... ...is at present, our country's most valuable foreign ally. And as most of you will be aware, we have just signed a new treaty together, after lengthy negotiations.
</line><line>Kazuma:
There can't be anyone who hasn't heard of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.
</line><line>Auchi:
And yet despite these delicate circumstances, the blood of an Englishman has been spilt on our soil! You two are both undergraduates at the Imperial Yumei University, are you not? Murdering a professor from the very institution that provides your education... Have you no honour?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(But I didn't do it...)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Judge:
This case is coming under great scrutiny from our allies on the other side of the world. The court therefore wishes for a speedy resolution to this matter.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hmph. In other words, our feeble government is scared of upsetting England's policy makers. And you're a convenient and expendable scapegoat to blame for this crime.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So that's why this trial has these unusual <textEffects>peculiarities</textEffects>, is it?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Exactly. Our government needs to convict someone as quickly as possible. All because the victim was <textEffects>an Englishman</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, Dr Wilson was an Englishman... But nationalities and treaties won't make any difference for me here. The fact is, I was there at the scene of the crime...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a little longer. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The British Empire... Wow, it's incredible to think- ......... Wait. I've seen that man at university. I'm sure he's a visiting professor from Great Britain. I don't know his name, but still... I should go and say hello.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
So I went over to the professor's table... ...and introduced myself to Dr Wilson.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now, then...let me pose my next question to you, Defendant Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Judge:
How did this professor of medicine, Dr John H. Wilson, lose his life? State before the court <textEffects>the cause of death</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">The cause of death</textEffects>... Well, obviously, that was...um...)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... Remember that in court, every assertion must be backed up by <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
By <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>? But, how?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Find the piece of evidence that shows the professor's cause of death, and select '<textEffects>Present</textEffects>'. Do it now!
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Um, well... According to this document, the victim suffered a '<textEffects>he-morr-hagic death due to gunshot trauma</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Auchi:
Learn to read, you imbecile! That's <textEffects>the post-mortem report</textEffects>, I take it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry, yes! That's right. The, um, <textEffects>post-mortem report</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kazuma:
In the West, a doctor dissects corpses to identify the cause of death in an 'autopsy'. But here in Japan, a police officer merely <textEffects>inspects</textEffects> the body, and draws conclusions that way.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see! <textEffects>(As long as I'm not going to be tested on any of this later...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
This is a so-called <textEffects>photographic print</textEffects> of the scene of the crime. You can clearly discern scorch marks around the bullet hole produced by the powder explosion. In other words, we should assume that the victim was shot <textEffects>at close range</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. The court will accept this modern scientific evidence into the record.
</line><line><textEffects>The photographic print of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So that's a photographic print. Well, that's something I've never seen before... It's clearly superior to a drawing. The detail is incredible...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. I am satisfied with your answers. Let us start the trial.
</line><line>Auchi:
Certainly, Your Excellency. So, without further ado, in order to better apprise the court with the facts of the case... ...the prosecution hereby calls its first witness, who was there at the scene of the crime when it happened!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh... This is it, then...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hmph.. I think I may have worked out what the professor had in mind. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The professor? You mean, Dr Mikotoba?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes. Clearly, you're the defence lawyer today, not me. But that doesn't mean... Well, I can still act as your <textEffects>assistant</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! <textEffects>(Of course!)</textEffects> When he was speaking with me before, he simply said: 'Kazuma Asogi must not be the <textEffects>defence lawyer</textEffects> in this trial.'
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, he really has been sticking his oar in, hasn't he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Maybe, but...any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated, Kazuma!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, my first piece of advice is: Rein in that crazy look of bewilderment and control the cold sweats!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Only if you rein in that crazy headband and control the cold stares first...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Auchi:
Witness. State your name and occupation for the court, please.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course. My name is <textEffects>Satoru Hosonaga</textEffects>. I am the head waiter at a Western-style restaurant called 'La Carneval'. Ahem! ...Ahem!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...are you alright? You seem to be coughing up some, er...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It's a regular occurrence. It really doesn't bother me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well, it really, really should...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
As everyone knows, the capital's south-eastern quarter was developed for foreign visitors some years ago. It's become a very fashionable district now, full of hotels to accommodate overseas guests. This grim crime occurred in one of the district's so-called 'restaurants' - an occidental eatery - three days ago.
</line><line>Judge:
Understood. Hosonaga-san, you will kindly tell the court everything you can about the incident.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
At once, sir.
</line><line>Auchi:
And no petty interjections from the aspiring lawyer boy, please.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... <textEffects>(Perspiring, maybe, but aspiring...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It was just after 2 p.m. on the day in question. We have few diners at that time of day. The lunchtime rush was over, and there were only three tables still occupied.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That fits in with my memory of it, too. There was hardly anyone else in the place.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem! It was when I was in the kitchen, putting away crockery and cutlery... A gunshot rang out, so I hurried out to the dining area to see what had happened. I found the victim - an English gentleman - slumped in his chair. And standing immediately beside him, gun in hand, was the accused university student.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hold on! Let me just clarify something here! While I did pick up a gun that I found lying on the floor beside the professor, I... I didn't shoot him!

</line><line>Auchi:
I believe I asked you to refrain from petty interjections. The court wishes to listen to the witness's report of what he saw, you amateur!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...
</line><line>Judge:
The next time you interrupt at an inappropriate time, you will be <textEffects>penalised</textEffects>, Defendant Naruhodo.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Don't worry, Ryunosuke. You'll have your chance to fight back. For now, we must just quietly listen to the witness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Auchi:
If I may confirm one point, waiter... Standing beside the victim with a gun in his hand was the same man we see here in court today?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes. Without question. 
</line><line>Auchi:
I see. And apart from the accused, was there <textEffects>anyone else</textEffects> standing beside the victim?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
No. There was no one else around that table but the deceased Englishman and the university student.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh? <textEffects>(Wait, what did he just say? '<span style="color:#E16935">There was no one else around that table</textEffects>'?)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
What's the matter, Ryunosuke?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's... That's just not right! When I went over to Dr Wilson to say hello... ...there was <textEffects>a woman</textEffects> sitting opposite him at his table!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Really?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that's not something the waiter could have missed! <textEffects>(I've been warned about interjecting, but still... What should I do?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Just a moment, please! Dr Wilson wasn't alone that day! I'm sure of it. There was a lady sitting with him at the same table!
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
Dear me, dear me. What are we going to do with you? With your blatant disregard for court proceedings, I'm beginning to wonder if you're not a fraud. Could it be that the accused - this mere student - is not a real lawyer after all?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...I'm sure of what I saw!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hosonaga-san, is there any chance you're mistaken? Perhaps your <textEffects>memory</textEffects> of events is hazy?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... No. The deceased gentleman came to dine alone.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I don't believe it...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem! I actually have a rough plan of the restaurant as it was that day. Please, have a look if you'd like to.
</line><line>Judge:
Let me see... Ah, <textEffects>a sketch</textEffects> of the establishment's layout drawn by yourself, I presume?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That's right. I'm afraid I used the back of my business card. It was a...turbulent situation. However, as you can see, the gentleman in question was seated alone.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, you're clearly a very conscientious waiter.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Thank you, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
The court will take this plan and add it to <textEffects>the Court Record</textEffects> as evidence.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Oh, um... Well...
</line><line>Judge:
Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Um...of course. Here you are.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What was that about? He's been completely calm and collected until now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Something certainly seems to have <span style="color:#E16935">shaken</textEffects> him...)</span>
</line><line><textEffects>The waiter's business card has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
So...the court has now heard a precis of the case.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, at the moment the gunshot was heard in the restaurant... ...the only person <textEffects>in close proximity</textEffects> to the victim was the defendant on trial today. It would seem we are looking at a black-and-white case here.
</line><line>Kazuma:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Defendant Naruhodo...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Your Excellency?
</line><line>Judge:
If you admit your guilt at this stage, the court is willing to look mercifully upon you.
</line><line>Auchi:
In other words, you may have some small reprieve in terms of your inevitable punishment. I called this waiter as an unsworn witness in order to explain the details of the case to the court. But I must warn the defence, if you are determined to pursue matters further in this trial... ...the prosecution has decisive evidence from sworn <textEffects>witnesses</textEffects> who were present at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... What do you think I should do, Kazuma?
</line><line>Kazuma:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, I'm going to be found guilty one way or another, it seems. Wouldn't it be sensible to plead guilty at this stage and hope for a more lenient sentence?
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Everyone keeps telling me that this trial is unusual - about these...'<textEffects>peculiarities</textEffects>'. You've said it, Professor Mikotoba's said it...and so has the judge and the prosecution. I'm... I'm scared of what lies ahead if I push this.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... As I said from the outset, I believe you're innocent. I trust you. And yet, despite knowing that... ...you're willing now to throw that trust back in my face? Is that it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Kazuma:
If the accused is in fact innocent... ...then a defence lawyer is duty-bound to prove that innocence by whatever means necessary. Are you just going to abandon that duty? Are you going to give up on yourself? The battle hasn't even begun yet, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
The defence pleads not guilty, Your Excellency! We invite the prosecution to stop making empty threats and bring out its <textEffects>witnesses</textEffects>. Then we'll see just how decisive this evidence really is!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. Prosecutor Auchi, please continue with proceedings.
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsk, well, you were warned. The young can be so reckless. You know, many call me a saint. But I can be a devil when I want to be.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Auchi:
In a few short moments from now... ...that dumbstruck young mouth of yours will be silenced, forever! The prosecution calls its next witnesses!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Officer! Bring forth the witnesses at once!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Auchi:
Witnesses, kindly state your names and occupations for the court.
</line><line>Nosa:
Yessir! The great Nippon Imperial Army's Sergeant <textEffects>Iyesa Nosa</textEffects> reporting for duty, sir!
</line><line>Korekuta:
Myself, I find employ as a purveyor of fine articles of antiquity from the efflorescence of our nation, Nippon... ...and conduct my trade from Rasu-tei, a humble premises in the second district. <textEffects>Kyurio Korekuta</textEffects>, at your service.
</line><line>Judge:
An antique dealer and a soldier... What an unusual pairing!
</line><line>Auchi:
Both of these gentlemen were present at the restaurant on the day in question.
</line><line>Kazuma:
They must be the diners at the other table that the waiter mentioned.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Myself, I habitually take tea of the most exquisite aroma at the establishment in question. Always post noon. And, not infrequently, converse with interested parties regarding the curios with which I make my business.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I can't understand a word that old man is saying...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
He's an antique dealer. And it sounds like he's a regular at La Carneval. He seeks out potential customers who may have an interest in antiques and tries to sell his wares to them. He obviously targets La Carneval because it's a high-class restaurant with rich clientele. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right, I see. Although, to be honest... ...that sergeant looks more like he'd be a seller rather than a buyer.
</line><line>Auchi:
Now, you both witnessed <textEffects>the precise moment</textEffects> of this most atrocious incident. Is that correct?
</line><line>Nosa:
Affirmative! The enemy unit was seen attacking the foreigner in what can only be described as an act of war! Sir! It was that black-uniformed rogue infantryman over there who unloaded his firearm, sir!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This man's as impossible to understand as the other... But I'm almost sure I heard a strange noise during that last thing he said...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
So, this is the decisive evidence the prosecution was threatening. The soldier is claiming that he actually saw <textEffects>the precise moment</textEffects> you shot the victim dead. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well? Are you starting to feel uncomfortable?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If I'm honest...I was feeling uncomfortable from the start.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, the court will hear your formal testimony, please. You will state everything you saw at the precise moment that the incident occurred.
</line><line>Nosa:
Sir, yessir! Standing by ready to report, sir!
</line><line>Korekuta:
Hm... Unsavoury memories of a most acerbic afternoon...

<center>Witness Testimony
<textEffects>- What the Witnesses Saw -</textEffects></center>
<line>Nosa:
I was ingesting a regulation beef steak at the restaurant while having a tactical discussion with the old man.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Myself, I was extolling the virtues of a particularly fine golden curio to the military gentleman.
</line><line>Nosa:
At that precise moment, a firearm was discharged! I observed the enemy's actions with my own eyes!
The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!
</line><line>Korekuta:
I was on my hands and knees, investigating the where-abouts of my mysteriously absconded precious curio.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well! So you, Sergeant Nosa, actually witnessed the vital moment! You saw the split second when the defendant fired the weapon at the victim.
</line><line>Nosa:
Yessir! Affirmative, sir! That wicked university cadet, sir! The cruel and unforgivable enemy!
</line><line>Korekuta:
What times we live in, when an English gentleman may be assailed in the broad light of day...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But, but this is ridiculous! I didn't shoot anyone!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Is that really true, Ryunosuke?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! All I did was pick up the gun that I saw lying on the floor! After I'd said hello to Dr Wilson, I went back to my table and sat drinking more coffee. Then, when I'd finished, I got up from my seat to leave the restaurant... ...when I noticed an English-made <textEffects>gun</textEffects> next to the chair where the professor was sitting. I thought perhaps the professor had dropped it. So I bent down, and just as I was picking it up...
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
Well, if that's the truth, there was obviously a criminal on the scene somewhere. And somewhere in these two <textEffects>witnesses' testimonies</textEffects>, there's a clue as to who that criminal was.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There is?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke! You must exercise your right to <textEffects>cross-examine</textEffects> the witnesses!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Cross-examine?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Do it now!
</line><line>Auchi:
As we have heard, Your Excellency... ...there is no room for doubt in the testimony of these witnesses. The defendant is clearly guilty. It is time to bring this despicable student to justice!
</line><line>Judge:
Certainly, the testimony the court has just heard eliminates any vestige of doubt. Therefore, it is my grave duty to declare the verdict of this tri-

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
What in the name of the Emperor is the meaning of this outburst?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, am, erm... I mean, the defence... ...demands its right to a cross-examination!
</line><line>Auchi:
Dear me, dear me. Let me guess? 'The hachimaki headband boy next door told me to do it.' How pathetic.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh? <textEffects>(How did he know?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
The prosecution objects! This is a clear waste of time. The defendant obviously has no experience. How can he possibly carry out a cross-examination?
</line><line>Kazuma:

</line><line>Kazuma:
The defence is asserting its RIGHT to a cross-examination! Whether or not you think he's capable of it is irrelevant.
</line><line>Auchi:
*Gulp!*
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Kazuma is so commanding!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let the defence conduct a cross-examination of the witnesses. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Alright, this is where the battle really begins, Ryunosuke!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...I don't even know what I have to do in a cross-examination!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Isn't it obvious? You have to expose <textEffects>the lies</textEffects> in the witnesses' statements!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
How?
</line><line>Kazuma:
You didn't fire the gun, which means what that soldier said has to be a lie.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well yes, but...
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's just a case of proving it. And the key to doing that is <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right... Evidence...
</line><line>Kazuma:
All you need to do is present some decisive and indisputable evidence that proves the witness is lying. Now let's go, Ryunosuke! Don't let them beat you!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright then! <textEffects>(It's all or nothing...)</textEffects>

<center>Cross-Examination
<textEffects>- What the Witnesses Saw -</textEffects></center>
<line>Nosa:
<textEffects>I was ingesting a regulation beef steak at the restaurant while having a tactical discussion with the old man.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Korekuta:
<textEffects>Myself, I was extolling the virtues of a particularly fine golden curio to the military gentleman.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Nosa:
<textEffects>At that precise moment, a firearm was discharged! I observed the enemy's actions with my own eyes!</textEffects>

<line>Korekuta:
<textEffects>I was on my hands and knees, investigating the where-abouts of my mysteriously absconded precious curio.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh... I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Listen, Ryunosuke... We know there are <textEffects>lies</textEffects> lurking in these statements. It's time to expose them.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I understand that. The question is...how?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Like I said before, the key to this is using <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that you've collected. You can examine and <textEffects><b>Present</b></textEffects> evidence while a witness is giving testimony by pressing [R / RB / E]. Go through each witness <textEffects>statement</textEffects> and <textEffects>the details</textEffects> about each piece of evidence, and compare all the facts. Somewhere in there, you'll find something that doesn't add up. In other words, <textEffects>an inconsistency</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
An inconsistency...
</line><line>Kazuma:
When you find a statement and a piece of evidence that seem to contradict each other... ...<textEffects><b>Present</b></textEffects> your evidence with [X / Y / R], and rip the witness apart!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Just be careful, because if you assert a contradiction that has no basis, you'll be given <textEffects>a penalty</textEffects>. If you're dealt too many penalties, the defence's case will fall apart, and you'll receive a <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> verdict. So that's it. Peruse the evidence in the Court Record and find an inconsistency with a witness's statement. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll give it a try!
</line><line>Kazuma:
You can hear the witnesses' statements over and over again, as many times as you like. So keep your head, and be measured in your attack. Good luck...partner!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
The victim, Dr Wilson, died from a bullet wound to <textEffects>the chest</textEffects>.
</line><line>Nosa:
Ah...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Sergeant. According to your witness statement... ...the culprit shot the victim <textEffects>from behind</textEffects>. And that is the obvious discrepancy here. Well? How do you explain it?
</line><line>Nosa:
Ooh...erm... Agh...um... Well, er... Hnn... Hnn...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What...the...? What was that? Something just popped up from behind his back but he pushed it down again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Certainly, there is a clear discrepancy with the facts here. Would you not agree, Sergeant Nosa?
</line><line>Nosa:
......... Yes, sir... At this juncture, that...would appear to be indisputable. Until the moment I heard the firearm discharge, my eyes were... ...firmly fixed on the delicious La Carneval steak! Sir!
</line><line>Auchi:
WHAT?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
The last testimony the court heard has proven one thing beyond all reasonable doubt. The witness, Sergeant Iyesa Nosa... ...did NOT see the defendant firing a gun at all!
</line><line>Auchi:
Ugh... That's, that's absurd...
</line><line>Kazuma:
I think the conclusion we must draw is simple... There is no place for an amateur prosecutor here in this grand courtroom!
</line><line>Auchi:
Kgnrk... KYAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(There's been a complete turnabout in the mood of this trial...just from that one discrepancy. So this is what being <span style="color:#E16935">an ace attorney</textEffects> is all about!)</span>
</line><line>Nosa:
But... But I definitely saw him! That university cadet, there! He was pointing the firearm directly at the victim's back!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I never fired the gun! All I did was pick it up off the floor!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... And you, old man. You didn't see the moment the victim was shot, either?
</line><line>Korekuta:
......... Myself, I have already been quite clear. The gunshot interested me not. I was far too busy on the floor.
</line>


<line>Korekuta:
Hunting around under the table, I was, in case mayhap it had fallen there. ...And then it happened.
</line><line>Kazuma:
You heard the gunshot, you mean?
</line><line>Korekuta:
Indeed I did! But I heeded it not, for I was concerned only with finding my absconded Hoei treasure! NOTHING could distract me!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Out of interest... ...did you find the coin in the end?
</line><line>Korekuta:
......... No.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm. I see.
</line><line>Korekuta:
That lamentable day...the precious <textEffects>Hoei koban</textEffects> was lost to me. No doubt some unscrupulous scoundrel pocketed the prize coin for himself! 
</line><line>Nosa:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
As I am sure everyone present is aware... ...this case demands a swift and decisive resolution. Our government has promised to send a full report to Great Britain by telegraph this very afternoon.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Nevertheless! The witness testimony the court has just heard was inconclusive. No matter how subservient our government feels it must be to the British... ...it would be unforgivable to deliver a verdict on this trial right now!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... What is your position, Prosecutor Auchi?
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsh huh huh! Worry not, Your Excellency. The defendant may have fled a tiger at the front gate, but he will find a wolf at the back.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
My witnesses have further testimony to make. 
</line><line>Judge:
Explain.
</line><line>Auchi:
Upon hearing their next statements, it will become abundantly clear... ...that there is only one person who could possibly have committed this despicable crime. The equally despicable defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
WHAT?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
He really seems to have a despicable opinion of you, doesn't he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, the court invites the witnesses to testify again. You will thoroughly explain the reasoning behind the prosecution's allegation. Is that clear?
</line><line>Korekuta:
As clear as kiriko glass, Your Excellency. 
</line><line>Nosa:
Yessir, at once, sir! Awaiting signal to testify, sir!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me, but there's something - or someone - peeking out over your shoulder, I think...
</line><line>Nosa:
Affirmative! The newest member of the Nosa family to rise up through the ranks, sir. Name: Aido.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, it would seem those straps are a sign of the sergeant being too strapped to afford a nanny. 
</line><line>Nosa:
Aido... Teeen-shun! Your father is about to quell the enemy! Watch and learn, my boy!

Even if what I saw wasn't the precise moment the firearm was discharged, it's almost the same thing!
</line><line>Korekuta:
Yes, pointing his gun at the foreign man, he was, that young lad in black. That much I myself did see.
</line><line>Nosa:
Furthermore! A visual search of the premises at the time confirmed that we were the only personnel present. 
</line><line>Korekuta:
Indeed. Alone, he was, the Englishman. Dining all by himself.
</line><line>Nosa:
Therefore! No one other than the black-uniformed cadet could have dispatched the Englishman. Over and out!

But there was a woman! There was a young woman at his table! You must have seen her! Everyone there must have seen her!

</line><line>Auchi:
If you call yourself a lawyer, then you will respect the rules of the court and speak accordingly! We are not here to listen to your fantasies!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Auchi:
It is evident beyond all reasonable doubt that the victim was alone at the time of the incident. The prosecution has photographic evidence of this fact. 
</line><line>Judge:
Is this a photographic print of the scene of the crime, Counsel?
</line><line>Auchi:
Indeed. Of the table at which the victim was dining, taken by an investigator immediately after the incident. As can plainly be seen, there is only one place set.
</line><line>Judge:
Certainly, based on the appearance of this print... ...it would be reasonable to conclude that the victim was not in the company of anyone else. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Arg... <textEffects>(This doesn't make any sense...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The court will add this new photographic evidence to the record. 
</line><line><textEffects>The photographic print of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't understand... <textEffects>(What's going on here? It's just not possible that nobody else saw that <span style="color:#E16935">woman</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
The waiter before said the same thing. He maintains that Dr Wilson came to the restaurant alone as well.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But that's not true! I...I saw her...! I swear that I saw a woman with him...
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem that we'll be able to telegraph the report to Great Britain on time after all. The witness testimonies we have just heard leave no further room for doubt.
</line><line>Auchi:
These are very sensitive political times, as we all know. The ink is still fresh on the treaty with Great Britain. To think that I, Taketsuchi Auchi, will have contributed to the amity of these two great empires is an honour.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(How can this be happening? The judge is ready to rule!)</textEffects> 
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>Stand tall, Ryunosuke. It's not over yet.</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Kazuma:
If what you say is true, then there's something going on here behind the scenes. And now is your chance to expose it. To draw out the truth. ...In your cross-examination.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I don't know, Kazuma...
</line><line>Judge:
The defence is entitled to cross-examine the witnesses. But make it quick. Understood?
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsk. Rules can be so unbending at times.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...

<line>Nosa:
<textEffects>Even if what I saw wasn't the precise moment the firearm was discharged, it's almost the same thing!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Korekuta:
<textEffects>Yes, pointing his gun at the foreign man, he was, that young lad in black. That much I myself did see.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Nosa:
<textEffects>Furthermore! A visual search of the premises at the time confirmed that we were the only personnel present.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
If I may, I'd like to ask for that medical report card to be submitted as evidence, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Auchi:
On what grounds?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm...
</line><line>Auchi:
The court has already heard conclusive witness testimony. Additional evidence would be extraneous. Not to mention that the victim's movements prior to his arrival at the restaurant are of no concern. 
</line><line>Kazuma:

</line><line>Kazuma:
Whether or not they are of concern is up to us to decide! We have a right to explore all possible avenues.
</line><line>Auchi:
I, I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Kazuma:
You have no authority to refuse a perfectly valid request for the submission of evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court will grant the defence's request.
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsk! Youngsters these days are forever asserting their 'rights'! It's a most disturbing trend...
</line><line>Judge:
Officer, kindly add the victim's medical report card to the Court Record.
</line><line><textEffects>The victim's medical report card has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
What we need right now is new clues. We have to explore things from every possible angle, even if they don't seem relevant at first. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right, I hear you!
</line><line>Auchi:
Hmph! You can conspire to prolong this trial as much as you like. But it's the day after the festival already for you! Or perhaps you'd forgotten...that these witness testimonies leave no room for doubt! Feel free to reiterate for the accused, Korekuta-san.

<line>Ryunosuke:
Um...erm... Well, I think, um...
</line><line>Korekuta:
About what are you wittering, lad? Call yourself a lawyer?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I wish I could... But first and foremost here, I'm the accused.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... Everyone stumbles on their words occasionally. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't worry about it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thanks, Kazuma.
</line><line>Kazuma:
I could see it quite clearly in that cross-examination you just carried out. When you raised your hand straight up like that, so purposefully... You knew exactly what it was you wanted to say. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Don't feel like you have to choose your words carefully. Just say what you're thinking.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Alright. ...And thanks for the advice. Korekuta-san, this is a medical report card belonging to the victim.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Ah, I see... And...I don't see. What of it, boy?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Comparing what is written on this report card with your witness statement... ...something clearly doesn't add up!

</line><line>Auchi:
Dear me, dear me. Have you forgotten my words so soon, you amateur?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry, what...?
</line><line>Auchi:
You are not to interrupt court proceedings with your amateurish drivel!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...
</line><line>Auchi:
Let's see if I can explain in words you might understand. It was after 2 p.m. in the afternoon when the victim was murdered at the restaurant. Whatever he may or may not have done <textEffects>before that time</textEffects>...is completely irrelevant.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Grrr... But, but that's...um...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Remember, Ryunosuke, you don't have to use clever language or fancy words. Just make your point.
</line><line>Auchi:
Your Excellency, I believe we're finished here. There is surely no need to prolong this trial further.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm...
</line><line>Auchi:
The witness testimonies the court has heard have been clear and concise. This medical report card has no bearing on the matter at all. For the simple reason that... ...there is no one else besides this pale-faced pupil who could possibly have perpetrated the crime!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This medical report card has nothing to do with the case? DO you really believe that?
</line><line>Auchi:
Wha...? That outburst half petrified me, boy! Of course I believe it! How could it POSSIBLY be relevant?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Perhaps because Hotta Clinic, which issued the report card...is a <textEffects>dental clinic</textEffects>!
</line><line>Auchi:
A dental clinic? Is that supposed to mean something to me?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Perhaps if I told you that the victim...had just had <textEffects>a tooth extracted</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Korekuta:
...! What's this now...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And furthermore... ...if I told you that as a result, the victim had been <textEffects>forbidden from eating</textEffects>...
</line><line>Auchi:
...!
</line><line>Korekuta:
...!
</line><line>Nosa:
...! Just, just what are you trying to say, cadet? He had <textEffects>orders not to eat</textEffects>? So what?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's all written up in here. 'No food or drink other than water for three hours post-procedure while anaesthesia wears off.' 
</line><line>Auchi:
WHAT?! No, that, that can't...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Korekuta-san!
</line><line>Korekuta:
What, boy? What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As you just heard... When he was killed, some time shortly after 2 p.m... ...the victim couldn't have been eating anything at all.
</line><line>Korekuta:
No...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Additionally...
</line><line>Nosa:
There's more...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You have assured the court with unwavering self-confidence... ...that the victim was dining alone. But that cannot possibly be the case!
</line><line>Nosa:
Grrr...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Because the victim, as we now know... ...had just had one of his teeth extracted, and was still experiencing the effects of the anaesthetic! 
</line><line>AAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Expertly done...partner!
</line><line>Auchi:

What... What is this nonsense? You little upstart!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Kazuma:
Use your head. That's the very discrepancy we're talking about. Or can't you follow the logic?
</line><line>Auchi:
How, how dare you?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I think it's fair to say that the 'tables' in this restaurant case...have turned. Wouldn't you agree, Ryunosuke?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm? Yes! Most definitely!
</line><line>Judge:
So having just undergone some dental surgery, the victim was unable to eat. Which leaves one very crucial conundrum... Who in fact was eating the pictured beef steak? The court will hear the opinion of the defence on this new puzzle. I assume you're ready, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........'Counsel'? Oh! That, that means me, doesn't it!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Alright, the answer to this question is going to be pivotal. This is the start of you <textEffects>turning this trial around</textEffects>! Show them what you're made of!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Got it! So, um... <textEffects>The person eating the steak at the victim's table must have been...</textEffects>
</line>




<line>Ryunosuke:
Obviously! It can only have been someone else who was sitting at the professor's table!
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There was! Because I saw her!
</line><line>Kazuma:
When the incident occurred, we know that the victim couldn't have been eating anything. Yet we have evidence of a half-eaten steak on his table! Therefore! The only logical conclusion is that there was somebody else there eating it.
</line><line>Auchi:
Urgggghhhh...
</line><line>Kazuma:
We have strong evidence to support our assertion. It's clear that these witness testimonies are unreliable. If the court decides to push through a ruling at this stage... ...we will lodge a formal complaint with the Ministry of Justice and pursue a fair retrial. Relentlessly.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...
</line><line>Auchi:
Are you insane? You, you would take on the government?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Don't worry, Counsel, I have no issue with you.
</line><line>Auchi:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Kazuma:
I have issue with THEM! Those two witnesses in the stand!
</line><line>Korekuta:
Wha...?
</line><line>Nosa:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Kazuma:
We have demonstrated with evidence that the victim was not alone. So, if it now turns out that the two of you deliberately lied when giving your testimonies... ...obviously you will be charged with <textEffects>perjury</textEffects>.
</line><line>Nosa:
Perjury...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
And, since this is a murder trial... ...you will also be deemed <textEffects>complicit</textEffects> in the killing.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Complicit...in m-murder...? N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOO!

<textEffects>(What?!)</textEffects> What did you just say, Korekuta-san?
</line><line>Korekuta:
Oh, um... No...

You were just 'following orders'?

'Say you <textEffects>never saw the gentlewoman</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Nosa:
Grrr...
</line><line>Kazuma:
When you say 'gentlewoman', do you mean... ...you saw the victim with <textEffects>a lady from overseas</textEffects>?

</line><line>Auchi:
What, what is the meaning of all this? These witnesses...gave false statements? Is this true, you pair?!
</line><line>Korekuta:
.........
</line><line>Nosa:
Just one... Just one simple slip of the tongue!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Counsel, explain what is going on here!
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's painfully clear now... You tried to prevent these witnesses from telling the truth!
</line><line>Auchi:
Absolutely not! The prosecution knows nothing of this!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then who's behind this?! Who tried to make you keep your mouths shut?
</line><line>Korekuta:
W-Well, um...
</line><line>Nosa:
That's classified!
</line><line>Kazuma:
So you're prepared to be tried as a conspirator to this murder, are you?
</line><line>Nosa:
You, you wouldn't... This can't be happening!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... Judging from the way they're reacting to this... ...I'd say they were sworn to silence by someone with considerable <textEffects>influence</textEffects>. However... ...I don't believe Auchi had any idea about it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What are you saying? I mean, to wield that kind of influence... There are only a handful of possibilities! <textEffects>(It could only have been <span style="color:#E16935">the government</textEffects>, <textEffects>the military</textEffects> or... Or <textEffects>the police</textEffects>, I suppose...)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well? Any ideas about who might be behind this? If we can affirm who tried to silence these witnesses, then we can continue our pursuit! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So we need to name whoever it was that tried to make the witnesses <span style="color:#E16935">keep their mouths shut</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Of course, we'll need evidence before we make any firm accusations. Evidence that proves whoever it was really did wield his or her power here... 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But how? How can we possibly...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Remember how we made progress before?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Before?
</line><line>Kazuma:
We examined this piece of evidence in more detail and found a new clue as a result. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, that's right.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, that's not the only piece of evidence we have, is it? We need to re-examine everything, and make sure there's nothing we've missed. There's no time to lose!
</line><line>Judge:
I want answers! If it's proven that these witnesses have been manipulated, I assure you, the penalty will be severe!
</line><line>Auchi:
Please...wait... Your Excellency! I had no idea about any of this! I swear to every Shinto god! I knew nothing! 
</line><line>Judge:
And what does the defence have to say about all this? Hm?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm, well, Your Excellency! <textEffects>(Ugh, no time to think... I'm just going to have to close my eyes and shout out the first name that comes into my head!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Besides the prosecution, the only person with the necessary influence to manipulate the witnesses is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Well, surely that would be...<textEffects>Satoru Hosonaga</textEffects>-san!
</line><line>Judge:
Hosonaga-san? The waiter who took the stand earlier?
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
Poppycock! What possible reason would the waiter have to make these witnesses give false testimony? Not to mention the fact that even a head waiter could not possibly have that level of influence!
</line><line>Kazuma:
For once, I would agree with you. If, that is, the man truly were a waiter.
</line><line>Auchi:
Wha...? If he truly were..?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Come on, Ryunosuke! Time to hit this court with the truth! <textEffects>The truth about Satoru Hosonaga-san's real identity, as proven by this evidence!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
The plan of the restaurant sketched by the man in question? Hm, I agree it shows a great deal of attention to detail, but I'm not sure we can conclude anything-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry, Your Excellency. That's <textEffects>the back</textEffects> of the card. It's <textEffects>the back</textEffects>...of <textEffects>the back</textEffects> of the card that's of interest.
</line><line>Judge:
I...beg your pardon?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Or, or perhaps I should have said, <textEffects>the front</textEffects>? Yes! It's <textEffects>the front</textEffects> of <textEffects>the back</textEffects> of the card! That's where the telling detail is!
</line><line>Judge:
......... Would somebody please explain what this overexcited student is trying to say?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hosonaga-san sketched the plan of the restaurant on the reverse side of his business card. The front of that business card reveals the man in question's <textEffects>profession</textEffects>. His true profession.
</line><line>Judge:
The waiter's profession? But that's surely... Good... Good gracious!
</line><line>Kazuma:
That's right, Your Excellency. The card reads, 'Chief Inspector, Primary Criminal Investigation Division, Imperial Police Bureau'. 
</line><line>Auchi:
WHAT?! The, the waiter is...a police detective?! I, I haven't heard any mention of this before! Why haven't I heard any mention of this before?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
The Imperial Police Bureau has immense power. Absolute power, as far as regular civilians are concerned. So, witnesses there in the stand...
</line><line>Nosa:
...!
</line><line>Korekuta:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Was it in fact the waiter who gave you your orders? Was it he who told you <textEffects>not to mention</textEffects> that you'd seen this foreign gentlewoman at the scene?
</line><line>Nosa:
Erm, well...
</line><line>Korekuta:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In-Inspector Hosonaga...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I was worried something like this may happen. The moment you asked me to submit my sketch as evidence, I realised it was a possibility.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The court will take this plan and add it to <textEffects>the Court Record</textEffects> as evidence.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Oh, um... Well...
</line><line>Judge:
Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Um...of course. Here you are.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, I remember now... He did act strangely when the judge asked him to hand over his business card.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I strive to carry out all investigations flawlessly. It's my guiding principle. But I let myself be distracted when I made that sketch. It was an unusually careless mistake. 
</line><line>Auchi:
So...you mean to say... You really are a detective?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But why would a detective be working as a restaurant waiter? Ah! Of course! Your <textEffects>salary</textEffects> must be terrible!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I was working <textEffects>undercover</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Undercover...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes. There have been a series of <textEffects>incidents</textEffects> at the restaurant recently. In order to investigate, I decided to get a job there as a waiter, working undercover.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Incidents at the restaurant? What kind of incidents?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That would be classified police information, which I am not at liberty to divulge. However, I can state categorically that they are unrelated to this case of homicide. 
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Very well then, Inspector Hosonaga. But you will elaborate on one point for the court...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Judge:
We have just heard new information from the two witnesses beside you. That at the time of the shooting, there was in fact another person present at the victim's table.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
If that is indeed true... ...clearly you would also have been aware of this person's presence, having served at the table in question. However, your testimony did not allude to this other diner. Therefore, I am led to assume... ...that in your professional capacity as a police officer, you required these witnesses to be in agreement. Would that be correct?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem! ......... Correct, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Unbelievable!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, as I suspected...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Hosonaga:
As soon as I heard the gunshot, I ran out of the kitchen to see what had happened. The victim sat slumped in his chair, and beside him, gun in hand, stood the accused student. Sitting opposite the victim at the same table was a young lady whom I guessed to be an Englishwoman. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
So the truth comes out.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I immediately sealed off the restaurant and reported the incident to the bureau. It was then that I received some...<textEffects>special orders</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Special orders? You mean to say...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
'Remove the Englishwoman from the scene at once.' ......... It was made clear that the Englishwoman's presence at the restaurant was to be concealed. Those were my orders. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But! But what if this Englishwoman was the killer?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I think it would be in everyone's best interests not to pursue that idea.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The empire views the friendly terms of its relationship with Britain more highly than anything at the moment. An Englishman has been murdered on our soil. To name an Englishwoman as the primary suspect... Well, without irrefutable <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>, that would be completely out of the question.
</line><line>Kazuma:
So that's the reason for the disappearance of the phantom woman in this case.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But it's not right...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... ...One possibility does spring to mind.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Kazuma...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yumei University is currently hosting a number of exchange students from Great Britain. And I'm fairly certain that one of them, studying in the medical faculty's research laboratory... ...is a young Englishwoman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
...You're a shrewd man. I can see why you're the chosen candidate for the overseas study tour. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! You mean...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
When I removed the woman from the scene of the crime... ...I thought it prudent to check her identity first. 
</line><line>Judge:
Then the court demands that you name the lady in question at once, Inspector!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The Englishwoman sitting at the university professor's table was a certain <textEffects>Miss Jezaille Brett</textEffects>. She is indeed a foreign student studying in the research laboratory of Yumei University's medical faculty.
</line><line>Auchi:
Wha... What is happening heeeeeere?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I admit that under orders from the police bureau, I erased all evidence of this lady's presence at the scene... ...and ordered these witnesses to make no mention of her in their testimonies. It must now be up to Your Excellency to decide how to deal with this situation.
</line><line>Judge:
......... Very well. My thoughts on the matter are as follows... Thus far, the case presented to the court has been underpinned by a particularly critical premise. Namely, that <textEffects>the victim was dining alone</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
However, as we have now discovered that this premise is false... ...it would be a desecration of our justice system to ignore the truth and give a ruling at this point.
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
But, but, Your Excellency! That would mean missing the noon deadline of a ruling in order to send the telegraphic report to Great Britain! Our own government will surely be very displeased by such actions.
</line><line>Judge:
Calm yourself, Counsel. I will not allow the government of our country or any other to influence the proceedings of my courtroom. 
</line><line>Auchi:
Ugh!
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector Hosonaga...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, sir?
</line><line>Judge:
You will locate this Jezaille Brett and escort her to the courtroom with the utmost urgency.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
At once, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Auchi:
But, but that means you'll be going against the special orders you were given from the police bureau!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... As I said before... ...it is my guiding principle to carry out all investigations flawlessly. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, it won't be a problem?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Nothing will get in my way!
</line><line>Judge:
Court will adjourn briefly. The prosecution must call the English student, Jezaille Brett, to the witness stand. Do I make myself clear?
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy! 
</line><line>Judge:
Good. Then we will have a thirty-minute recess before reconvening.

<line>
Kazuma:
Excellent work, Ryunosuke! That was superb!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... My heart was in my mouth the entire time.
</line><line>Kazuma:
It was almost unbelievable. I mean, looking at you in there... You were drenched in sweat, your eyes popping, your knees knocking AND you were grinding your teeth. It was a grim sight, but before I knew it, you'd started finding inconsistencies in the testimonies. I think you might have a natural talent for being a lawyer.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Forget it! It's terrifying! If I get through this, I don't ever want to see the inside of a courtroom again!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! Anyway, it looks like we've exposed your phantom lady at least.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Miss Jezaille Brett... A student from Great Britain...is she?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's what I was trying to tell everyone from the start. Dr Wilson wasn't alone! There was a young woman with him. Like I've been saying all along! 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, you have, haven't you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I might not be overly confident in the courtroom, but my <textEffects>powers of observation</textEffects> are one thing I am sure of.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, I can see that. So...about this young gentlewoman... Thanks to our detective friend, she was hastily escorted away from the scene, it seems. Did you see what happened with that?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, I didn't see any of it. I was just on my way out of the restaurant myself. Then, on the floor next to Dr Wilson's table... ...I noticed there was a gun lying on the floor. And just after I bent down and picked it up...
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
I didn't have time to think about where the sound of the gunshot had come from. The waiter ran over to me, looking as white as a sheet... ...and he bundled me into some sort of small pantry next to the kitchen.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Fast thinking by the detective. He apprehended his suspect without a moment's delay.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, and because I was shut in the pantry... ...I have no idea what happened outside in the dining area.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hmm...
</line><line>???:
Ah, there you are. Well done, both of you.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Professor Mikotoba!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well... It seems I was right. The pair of you make an outstanding team. You've exceeded my expectations, I have to say.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes...it seems you planned this from the start. You arranged things so that I wouldn't be able to act as a lawyer in this trial.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
......... Our modern country is still in its infancy. Our justice system, even more so. Which is why... ...I firmly believe that we need to send our brightest young stars overseas to learn all they can. I wanted to avoid a situation that may have resulted in your study tour to Great Britain being cancelled.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... Well, it makes no difference. Lawyer or otherwise, if I'm the kind of man who can't help his best friend avert the worst crisis of his life... ...I shouldn't waste everyone's time by going to study overseas anyway.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! What are you saying, Kazuma?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Hmph. So that's your stance... I was afraid you'd feel that way.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Kazuma!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well then, it looks like it all comes down to you, young man.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
To, to me?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes. You need to prove your innocence, and uncover what really took place in that restaurant. I  must say, I very much want to know the truth. After all, I have a personal connection to this case.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, he said the same thing earlier this morning, didn't he?)</textEffects> Um, if you don't mind me asking, Professor... ...did you know the victim?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes, I did. As you're probably aware, Dr John H. Wilson was a visiting professor at Yumei. And it was I who invited him.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! I, I see...
</line><line>Kazuma:
I...didn't know that before. 
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Anyway, you're about to go into battle. The victim was a university professor from Great Britain. And a well known one at that. Naturally our government is looking to identify and punish the culprit as quickly as possible.
</line><line>Kazuma:
But let's not forget who we're going up against. The 'gentlewoman' whose involvement our police bureau went to extraordinary lengths to hide.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes, and I'm sure the prosecution will be using every tool at their disposal to quash your case. But I've no doubt that you pair will put up a good fight, right to the last. Best of luck!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Now then... ...I need you to run an errand at the university at once. There's something I think we may need. 
</line><line>???:
Of course. Good luck...Kazuma-sama.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Defendant Naruhodo! Court recess is over. Please make your way back inside the courtroom at once!
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's time. Let's get back to it, partner. Let's go in there and deal a decisive blow before those old fossils know what's hit them!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Um, Kazuma...
</line><line>Kazuma:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you. Really.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What for?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, if you hadn't said you believed me, then... ...I'm fairly sure I'd already have been found guilty by now.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Look, I have faith in you. As a lawyer, and as a friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Coming from you, that means a lot. <textEffects>(If I'm found <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</textEffects> in this trial... ...he's really going to give up on his dream of studying abroad. That's the kind of true friend he is. So this isn't just my battle any more. Whoever we're up against, we absolutely cannot afford to lose!)</span> Alright then... ...I'll save the thank-yous for after the trial.
</line><line>Kazuma:
You can treat me to one of those sukiyaki meals I like from 'Yumei Cafeteria' on University Street. With an extra large portion, of course!

Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
The court hereby resumes the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Prosecutor Auchi, have you managed to subpoena the witness?
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes, Your Excellency! Against all odds. And thanks to a certain young stripling, the prosecution is now under rather painful scrutiny from the government.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Let the government scrutinise. That's their job. It's nothing to worry about.
</line><line>Auchi:
It's highly unlikely that the good relations we've forged with Great Britain will emerge from this trial unscathed. Will you still think it's nothing to worry about when the new treaty breaks down and our nation founders?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Again... Terribly sorry...
</line><line>Kazuma:
If the friendship between our nations is really so fragile, then the treaty isn't worth the paper it's written on. You really have nothing to worry about, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Auchi:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A secret trial, anxiety over some foreign government's opinions, a bungled investigation, missing witnesses... Is this what our nation's justice system is? Is this the Supreme Court of Japan, or of England?!
</line><line>Auchi:
Shut up! Shut up, you jumped-up rookie boy! You and your friend know nothing! Nothing of the situation our nation finds itself in! By aligning ourselves with this great world power, we'll become strong! Diplomacy has never been more critical! Steady political manoeuvring is what will secure our futures!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I won't deny that I'm no expert. I'm just a student. And one who could arguably study harder, too. But standing here now in our Supreme Court, there is one thing that I feel very strongly: A country that fails to uphold the truth in its justice system is a country with no future at all.
</line><line>Auchi:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well said, Ryunosuke. Despite the wide-eyed look of terror.
</line><line>Auchi:
You little braaaaats!
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. This court is the pinnacle of our nation's justice system, and exists solely for the pursuance of truth. With that in mind, this trial will now resume with the next witness taking the stand. The visiting student from Great Britain, <textEffects>Miss Jezaille Brett</textEffects>!
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Auchi:
Well, what a delight it is to welcome such a fine gentlewoman to Japan! And from such a distant land!
</line><line>Judge:
Tea! Someone bring English tea! In England, no discussions take place without tea!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Is that true?
</line><line>Kazuma:
...No idea.
</line><line>Auchi:
So, erm... Ahem! Could we possibly trouble you to state your name and occupation for the court?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course. My name is <textEffects>Satoru Hosonaga</textEffects>. I have been working undercover as the head waiter at La Carneval, but my true-
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes, yes, we know all about you already!
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector Hosonaga! Where are your manners? In England, it's always ladies first!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Is that true?
</line><line>Kazuma:
...No idea. More importantly, a little earlier today you said something to me. You said your powers of observation are the one thing you're sure of.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes... I think I did, didn't I?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yet your description for this <textEffects>amazing sight</textEffects> was simply 'a woman'. Sorry, Ryunosuke, but powers of observation aside, your powers of description are sorely lacking.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Guilty.
</line><line>Auchi:
So, dear lady, once again, if we may trouble you for your name and occupation, please.
</line><line>???:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>.........
</line><line>Auchi:
Um, I'm terribly sorry, dear lady, but...what?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>?
</line><line>???:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The lady says her name is <textEffects>Jezaille Brett</textEffects>. She comes from London, England. She's <textEffects>a visiting research student</textEffects>, currently enrolled in Yumei University's medical faculty.
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh, my! What a rare treat to hear the dulcet tones of the delightful language of the British people! I'm afraid I don't understand a word you said, but it was as beautiful as a hummingbird's song! 
</line><line>Kazuma:
As far as I can tell... ...the detective is translating her words faithfully enough.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I agree. Haha, you'll obviously do fine in England, Kazuma. Her English doesn't rattle you at all, does it?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Nor you. You've clearly been paying attention in your English classes, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Judge:
The court thanks the beautiful lady for taking the stand. Now...if we may trouble you to confirm something, Miss Brett.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Three days ago, at a restaurant called La Carneval, a grim murder took place. The court has been led to believe that you were dining there with the victim, Dr Wilson, at the time. Is that correct?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>?
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
She says...'Yes.'
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This could take some time...
</line><line>Kazuma:
So even though <textEffects>she's studying here in Japan</textEffects>, she can't speak any Japanese?
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>. <i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
She'd like to apologise for disappearing from the scene. She says that she was due to make a presentation at the university, so she had to leave immediately. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Interesting, when you're the one who engineered her escape...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I was just following special orders from the bureau.
</line><line>Auchi:
Well now, dear lady, would you be so kind as to cast your eyes over this photographic print? Seeing as you were, so unfortunately, present at the scene of the crime... ...could it be that your resplendent eyes <textEffects>caught sight</textEffects> of the wicked perpetrator, perhaps?
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Apparently it was a very frightening...and sorrowful sight.
</line><line>Judge:
Do you mean to say...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes. It would appear the lady did witness the crime. <textEffects>The very moment</textEffects> when <textEffects>the accused</textEffects>, standing right there in this courtroom... ...shot the victim in cold blood!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in court!
</line><line>Auchi:
Did, did you hear that, Your Excellency? Here we have an absolutely conclusive witness statement!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, it looks like it's clear now. Clear who our real <textEffects>enemy</textEffects> is!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to formally testify, if you please. Kindly tell the court the exact nature of this frightening and sorrowful sight you described.

'I had arranged to meet for a slightly late luncheon with Dr Wilson that day.'
'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.'

</line><line>Auchi:
Quiet, you filthy wretch! Look at you, you black-hearted blackguard! And look at this snow-white angel! I'm sure even a dark-minded scoundrel like you can imagine whose words the court is going to believe!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Kazuma:
You're still making the same mistakes, Ryunosuke. You mustn't blurt out when you're goaded like that. That's a lesson you need to learn.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh, but he's so annoying!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course, I was at the scene as well. I took statements from this lady and the two witnesses who testified before, and reported back to the bureau. It was decided that Miss Brett was not involved, so I let her go.
</line><line>Kazuma:
The testimonies of the last two witnesses were completely worthless, however.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Well, even so... On the day in question, the lady was wearing the same outfit as she is today. As you can see, there is nowhere about her person where she could conceal a firearm. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I would think she could hide a gun almost ANYWHERE in that outfit if she wanted to...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
Unless and until the precise <textEffects>location</textEffects> where the witness is to have hidden a weapon can be shown, this is moot.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' Those are the witness's own words on the matter.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Argh! That's ridiculous! If only I was allowed to lift up her dress, I could prove it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Don't think about doing anything rash, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I didn't fire the gun I picked up! There must have been another gun there that day!
</line><line>Kazuma:
You're right about that. Which means...this lady was hiding a gun somewhere... Yes, that's what we have to <textEffects>prove</textEffects> now. And to do so, we will need to pull her testimony apart.
</line><line>Judge:
The defence may now cross-examine the witness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, Your Excellency!
</line>
<hr />
<center>Cross-Examination
<textEffects>- A Frightening and Sorrowful Sight -</textEffects></center>
<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>'I had arranged to meet for a slightly late luncheon with Dr Wilson that day.'</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects> 'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.'</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>'I ordered a beef steak for myself, and the professor and I said "cheers" over a glass of carbonated water.'</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>'After a while, the accused came over to greet the professor, and they got into a fierce argument.'</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>'Then, not long afterwards, the accused took the professor's gun, and shot him right before my eyes!'</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>'I don't carry a gun myself, so obviously I couldn't have been the culprit.'</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kazuma:
So she's maintaining that you got into an argument with the professor, at the end of which, you shot him.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which is an out-and-out, totally unfounded lie!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Still, her statement is very compelling. After all, she's an elegant, refined, young and beautiful gentlewoman from Great Britain. In stark contrast to you, dressed from head to toe in a dull black school uniform.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm dressed exactly the same way as you are, except for the flapping red ribbons!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well anyway, this is our only chance to expose her testimony as the fiction that it is.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
If we can't do that, the trial's over. Even you with your thick skin must be able to feel the murderous looks you're getting from around the room.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Only too well. I feel half dead already. <textEffects>(And the fact that I can't see a single inconsistency in her testimony isn't making me feel any better, either!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
The first thing to do is press her on any of her statements that seem even slightly off to you. Do that, and an opening will present itself. I promise you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I need to expose <span style="color:#E16935">the true face</textEffects> of this exotic foreigner that's hiding behind the mask. That's what I should be aiming for in this cross-examination...!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
......... That's it! Let me just confirm something, please. It's...to do with this photographic print. Just a short while ago, you spoke of this print showing the victim's table at the crime scene... ...that it was '<textEffects>exactly as it was left</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
'That is correct,' the lady says.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well! That is... It's, um... It's odd! Very odd!
</line><line>Auchi:
Dear me. What's odd is the defence's inability to express itself.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke, what is it about the print that looks odd to you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well obviously, it's...it's the '<textEffects>cheers</textEffects>'!
</line><line>Auchi:
The...'cheers'?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Brett just told us that she and the professor said 'cheers' over a glass of water. But if that's true... ...there should be <textEffects>two glasses</textEffects> on the table, not one!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
You're quite right, Counsel. There's only one glass pictured here!
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
Are we supposed to be impressed by this nit-picking over minutiae? What possible difference does the presence or absence of a glass make on the case?
</line><line>Kazuma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Minutiae, you say? Could it be that the detective here removed a glass from the table to conceal the lady's presence?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course not! I would never do something so reckless.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But there should have been two glasses on the table! Or are you going to try to tell me you can clink with only one?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... You're quite right. I certainly took two glasses to the table.
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector! What did the lady say?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It would seem that it was Miss Brett who took the glass from the table.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
'It was all so terrifying, everything that happened. I panicked and thought I should try to hide the fact that I'd been there at all,' she's saying.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious!
</line><line>Brett:
<i>...Sorry.</i>
</line><line>Auchi:
There, as I assured the court before... this is of no consequence at all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, please...
</line><line>Auchi:
We must remember that this student had just murdered the lady's luncheon companion before her very eyes! Who could blame her for concealing a glass or two in her state of disarray?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's absurd!
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh really? So do we take it that you are now going to accuse this vulnerable, young and beautiful woman of...mischief?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! No no no! This, this can't be put down to 'mischief'!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I'd like to know... ...exactly how the lady took the glass from the scene.
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It would seem that she slipped it into a small <textEffects>handbag</textEffects> she was carrying.
</line><line>Judge:
A handbag, you say?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, Your Excellency. A small, handheld pouch commonly carried by well-to-do women in England. 
</line><line>Auchi:
So, the beautiful lady has very graciously explained how and why she removed the glass from the scene now. However! The fact remains that this glass has absolutely no bearing on the case!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm...
</line><line>Auchi:
This student has been trying to confuse the court with logical reasoning! But in the end, it comes to nothing. No more pretentious accusations! You have wasted enough time already!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed, the lady has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why she removed this glass. I think henceforth we can consider the matter to have no bearing on the case. Counsel for the Defence, are you in agreement?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, well... <textEffects>(I don't know, really...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
If you want to pursue this matter further... ...you're going to need to show that it has some <textEffects>deeper significance</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. <textEffects>(So she took the glass away in her handbag. If there's a deeper significance there, it's...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! The lady put the glass in her handbag, you say?
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes. Do try to keep up. It's already been explained to the court that all English gentlewomen carry handbags for small items.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Let me see... A little while ago, Miss Brett stated the following... 'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' But! What she forgot to mention, was her handbag. In which it would be perfectly possible to <textEffects>conceal</textEffects> a gun!
</line><line>Judge:
You're right!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well done, partner. I had a feeling you'd pick up on that, too.
</line><line>Auchi:
What are you insinuating, you vile blackguard?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
It's really very simple. The gunshot was heard when the defendant picked up the gun from the restaurant floor. As he didn't fire that gun, we can deduce there must have been another firearm at the scene. The true <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>, if you will.
</line><line>Auchi:
You, you can't seriously be suggesting...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector Hosonaga!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Did you or did you not search Miss Jezaille Brett's handbag on the day of the murder?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
No, sir, I did not.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(As I thought!)</textEffects> In other words, another gun - the one that was actually used to kill the professor... ...could have been hidden in Miss Brett's handbag!
</line><line>Auchi:
Nnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Auchi:
What is the meaning of this, Inspector?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The meaning of what, Prosecutor Auchi?
</line><line>Auchi:
Why on earth did you not have the lady open her handbag and show you the contents at the time? Thanks to your bungling incompetence, now she has to endure these...uncomfortable accusations!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Brilliant work, partner! Now we have a chance to expose the real woman behind the mask!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you think so, Kazuma?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem! AHEM! ...AHEM! ...AHEM, AHEM! Well, what a sorry situation. Clearly you have no faith in the police.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
As I said, I did not search the lady's handbag after the shooting. Simply because...it was unnecessary.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Unnecessary in what way?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I ought to thank the student lawyer, really. I have a piece of evidence here that I had completely forgotten about. This photographic print. This print is of a photograph that I thought would be prudent to take immediately after the shooting. As you can see, it clearly shows Miss Brett's handbag.
</line><line>Judge:
Well I never! You can see right through to <textEffects>what's inside</textEffects>!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That's right. Apparently, meshwork bags like these are the height of fashion in London at the moment.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, so the contents are clearly visible.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Exactly. So there was no need to search the lady's handbag. If there had been a gun inside, it would have been immediately obvious.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh! 
</line><line>Hosonaga:
As you can see, there's nothing to imply Miss Brett's guilt here. Thank you for helping to prove that, Naruhodo-san.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Uh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Inspector Hosonaga, you will submit that print as evidence at once!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Certainly, Your Excellency.
</line><line><textEffects>The photograph of the handbag has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I think you've had long enough to cross-examine the witness, Counsel.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
The court has now been shown considerable evidence. As the photographic print just submitted into the Court Record appears to have no further significance... ...I am satisfied that there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.
</line><line>Auchi:
Indeed. And there is only one logical conclusion. That the pathetic rookie slumped over the bench before us is the only possible perpetrator of this crime.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(No... Just when I thought I was beginning to turn things around... I'm in a worse situation than I was at the start!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, Kazuma...
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... I'm sorry, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Now that the cross-examination of the witness is over, there's no way to force the trial to continue.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! You, you mean, this is it...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsh huh huh! I must say, you put up quite a fight...for a rookie student. But the weak are meat, while the strong eat! You were wasting your time. There is no way to defeat true justice! A fact you can chew on to your heart's content...from the inside of your cell!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This can't be happening...! Am I really going to be found guilty of a crime that I didn't commit? And Kazuma... His dream of going to study in Great Britain will slip through his fingers.)</textEffects> ......... Kazuma...
</line><line>Kazuma:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Is there really... Is there really no chance now of turning this trial around?
</line><line>Kazuma:
You heard the judge. There's nothing about that last photograph the detective produced that we can contest. Which means...there's no basis on which we can argue for the trial to continue.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. I will now proceed immediately to the ruling.
</line><line>Auchi:
It seems we will be able to report to the British government on time after all!
</line><line>Kazuma:
That smug little...
</line><line>Judge:
Ryunosuke Naruhodo, having considered all of the evidence placed before me, I hereby find you-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! ...Your Excellency!
</line><line>Kazuma:
...Ryunosuke?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I don't think you can rule on this case yet!
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
This amateurishness is getting tedious! When His Excellency deems that the trial is over, he gives his ruling. That is the most basic protocol of the courtroom!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your Excellency, just a moment ago you said this: 'As the photographic print just submitted appears to have no further significance... ...there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.' Now, that means that if there was a problem with the evidence - some significant detail, I mean... ...then ruling on the case at this time... would be out of the question!
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
This is blatant straw-clutching! Look at this photographic print! All it shows is the handbag the gentlewoman was carrying on the day in question. There can be no 'problem' with this evidence!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... 
</line><line>Kazuma:
You'd better know what you're doing, Ryunosuke.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... I understand your objection, Counsel. Certainly, the new evidence submitted by the detective has not undergone the court's scrutiny. However, I fail to see how we can glean any new information from this handbag. 
</line><line>Auchi:
Ha! My thoughts exactly! Really, the prosecution is becoming tired of this rookie's desperate wheezes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, I am desperate! But this isn't a wheeze. There's something about this photograph which just <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't seem right</textEffects>. If only I could put my finger on it...!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, I will grant the defence one final <textEffects>opportunity</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
What?!
</line><line>Judge:
But be warned that if I am unsatisfied by your response here, the trial will be over with immediate effect. Do I make myself clear?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Judge:
So, take another look at the photographic print Inspector Hosonaga submitted before. <textEffects>You will identify for the court where in this print we see the 'significant detail' to which you have alluded!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Look at this, here... There's a very unusual <textEffects>mark</textEffects> on the victim's <textEffects>wrist</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
That is true. It looks almost...like <textEffects>a burn</textEffects> of some description.
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
Dear me! I was pondering what new piffle you would come out with. A burn, you say? On the victim's wrist? Clearly that has nothing whatsoever to do with the magnificent lady's handbag!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, that is a burn mark, you're right.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Go on, Inspector.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The police coroner also noticed it when he was performing the post-mortem examination. It was deemed unrelated to the cause of death, so he didn't note it in his report.
</line><line>Auchi:
What did I tell you? In any case, we have no idea when the victim suffered this burn, do we? And no possible way of knowing, either.
</line><line>Judge:
The more I look at it, the more I find myself intrigued by the curious shape of this mark... However, as Prosecutor Auchi points out, unless a firm connection to the case can be shown... ...I cannot allow any further time to be spent on the precise details of this burn.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Brett:
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Excuse me, Your Excellency... It would seem Miss Brett has a lunch appointment with the dean and other university staff. She would like to know if she may be excused from the stand now.
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh, of course, of course, dear lady! We shan't hold you up any longer! I'm quite sure His Excellency is about to give his final ruling anyway.
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
What's your thinking on this, Ryunosuke? Do you believe this burn does have something to do with the case?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
To be honest, I'm not really sure. But if I don't keep pushing, then it's all over. So I was thinking I should keep digging and digging... in the hope that I might uncover something useful.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... Yes, you're right. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I am?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
If we can just link that burn to the case... If we can do that, we might be able to prise this shutting door back open again.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
Just give up, Counsel! You can't possibly hope to do that.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. I'm afraid that without evidence, I can't allow you to pursue what is little more than conjecture.
</line><line>Kazuma:
But if we had evidence? Evidence that irrefutably linked the burn on the victim's wrist to the case. Then you would allow it?
</line><line>Judge:
I would, yes.
</line><line>Kazuma:
To tell the truth, I hadn't noticed that burn. But as soon as you pointed it out, what I did notice... ...was the colour draining from Miss Brett's face.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really? <textEffects>(I have to find some link between that burn and the case... This is the moment of truth. It's time to find some evidence that proves what that burn really means!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So then, the defence will now present its evidence to the court. <textEffects>The evidence that demonstrates an inextricable connection between the victim's burn and this trial!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
What's this, Counsel? Yet another print?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Your Excellency. I believe photographic prints are an amazing invention. When we humans look at a scene, we miss things. But in a photograph, things we may have overlooked at the time are recorded forevermore.
</line><line>Auchi:
Do hurry up, rookie! What are you trying to say? To inconvenience this poor lady any further really would be quite inexcusable.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Actually, we may need you to stay with us a little longer, if you don't mind...Miss Brett.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You see, it's very clearly visible in this other photograph. How did the victim come to have that unusually shaped burn on his wrist? <textEffects>The reason</textEffects> is recorded here forevermore!
</line><line>Hosonaga:

</line><line>Auchi:
You can't fool me with your little bluffs, boy! If that's your game, then let's see how it plays out! Show the court exactly what you mean! <textEffects>What is it in this photograph that explains the reason for the victim's burn?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Auchi:
The, the beef steak?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Actually, the point is <textEffects>the metal plate</textEffects> the steak was served on.
</line><line>Judge:
The plate? Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Auchi:
Your Excellency! Are you alright?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As you can see, there's <textEffects>an emblem</textEffects> on the plate. I would guess it's some sort of trademark of La Carneval.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The <textEffects>emblem</textEffects> on the plate... ...and the victim's <textEffects>burn</textEffects>... ...are <textEffects>exactly the same</textEffects> shape!
</line><line>Auchi:
Aaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke! You genius!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
You're spot on...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which means... ...the victim must have suffered this burn while he was present at the restaurant!
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
But... But even if that is the case... ...we can't know if it happened on the day in question or not. It could've been the day before! Or the day before that! It most likely happened at some other, unrelated time!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...um... Hm...
</line><line>Kazuma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Sadly, Prosecutor Auchi, the chances of that are extremely slim.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thanks...
</line><line>Auchi:
Why?
</line><line>Kazuma:
The outline of the burn is clearly discernible. Such a serious injury would have caused quite a commotion in the restaurant. Wouldn't you agree, Inspector Hosonaga?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I can't imagine having missed such a terrible disaster, certainly.
</line><line>Auchi:
But, but...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I would say, looking at the picture of the wound, that it wasn't suffered very long ago. And, although it's not a particularly large burn, it's extremely well defined, as the defence just pointed out. This was no mild burn, that's for sure.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Can you be more specific, Inspector?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Well, let's see... ...if the plate was at around ninety degrees centigrade, a burn like that would have taken around <textEffects>three seconds</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
It's inconceivable that the victim wouldn't have let out <textEffects>a scream</textEffects> of pain, then.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I've been investigating at the restaurant for several weeks already, but I've not heard anyone scream at all. As the head waiter of La Carneval, I can testify to that without hesitation.
</line><line>Auchi:
But you... You're a detective, not a waaaiteeer!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There you have it! Something isn't right here! As the detective said... ...anyone who burnt themselves on a piping hot plate for three whole seconds would scream in pain. There's no question of that.
</line><line>Kazuma:
And yet Inspector Hosonaga never heard the professor scream. Not on that day, or any before it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. And the strange thing is... ...on the day he was shot, I <textEffects>didn't hear</textEffects> him cry out, either.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What are you suggesting?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, if the professor had carelessly laid his wrist on the plate for anything like three seconds that day...
</line><line>Judge:
That would be beyond careless, I think, Counsel.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...then the rest of us in the restaurant - myself, the sergeant and the old antiques dealer... All of us would, without any question, have heard him scream. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Auchi?
</line><line>Auchi:
Hm? Um, well... Yes, I suppose...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So the question is... ...why didn't a single person hear Dr Wilson scream?
</line><line>Auchi:
...!
</line><line>...!
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I, I almost don't believe it! Ryunosuke, do you think...? 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Can it really be true? I never dreamt we'd arrive at a conclusion like this, but... I'm starting to think that maybe... ...we've been led into a terrible <span style="color:#E16935">trap</textEffects>!)</span> There's only one explanation I can think of to make sense of this apparent impossibility. <textEffects>On the day in question, when he suffered the burn to his wrist, Dr Wilson...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
No man could remain silent while his wrist was burning on a piping-hot plate for three whole seconds. That's clearly impossible. Apart from in one particular situation...
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, are you suggesting...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's only possible...if the man was already <textEffects>dead</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
A-Already...
</line><line>Judge:
Dead?
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Knowing what we know now, it's the only possible explanation. When the beef steak was brought to Dr Wilson's table that day... ...the professor...was already <textEffects>dead</textEffects>!
</line><line>Auchi:
That's... That's... ...madneeessssss!
</line><line>Judge: 
Order! Order! Order, please! Counsel, explain this absurd notion at once! The victim was killed by <textEffects>a gunshot</textEffects>!
</line><line>Auchi:
That's right! That's absolutely right, Your Excellency. This, this is just another ridiculous ploy by the rookie student! But clearly, he has no grasp of the facts!
</line><line>Kazuma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kazuma:
No, Prosecutor Auchi, it's you who has no grasp of the facts.
</line><line>Auchi:
I beg your pardon?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
As soon as it became apparent that the victim had suffered that burn while at the restaurant... ...this whole case was turned upside-down. Or have you not grasped that yet?
</line><line>Auchi:
Urrr... Ugh...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Your Excellency! The court MUST hear from this witness again. If it's true, as we now believe, that the victim was already dead before the gunshot was heard... ...it's highly likely that Miss Brett knows something about it!
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Incredible... I certainly didn't anticipate this twist of events. I'm sorry to say, Miss Brett... ...that you will have to forget your luncheon engagement. 
</line><line>Auchi:
B-But, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
The justice system in our country may be in its infancy... ...but rest assured, all reasonable doubt must be dispelled before I am prepared to pass judgement. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What was that smile?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brett:
<i>Yes, of course... I mean-</i> I'd be delighted to help. Especially if it helps relations between my country and yours.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Auchi:
Ah... Miss, Miss Brett... You...speak Japanese?
</line><line>Brett:
<i>Well,</i> of course I do. I am studying in your country, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
But...then...why have you been speaking through an interpreter until now?
</line><line>Brett:
My mother tongue - <i>the Queen's English</i> - is the most refined and elegant language in the world. As a gentlewoman, I try to avoid speaking in your vulgar tone as much as possible.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Brett:
But it seems the men in this land possess none of the chivalrous virtues of English gentlemen. So I can see that I shall have to lower myself to communicating with you all on your own level.
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh... Ah...well... You are the epitome of a true English gentlewoman! We are truly honoured by this... This lavish consideration you so graciously afford us!
</line><line>Judge:
......... I see. In that case, Miss Brett, I will now ask you to testify in your own words... ...about the events leading up to the death of the victim, Dr Wilson!
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
So, we're finally going to hear her own words on the matter. Things are getting interesting, Ryunosuke!

<center>Witness Testimony
<textEffects>- The Victim's 'Death' -</textEffects></center>
<line>Brett:
Unfortunately, I have no idea when the poor man burnt his wrist like that.
When the waiter brought my steak, the professor and I raised our glasses in a toast.
As far as I've heard, the post-mortem report showed no other possible cause of death besides the gunshot.
If there's some other way a man's life can been <i>[sic]</i> taken without leaving a trace, please, do show me.
But of course...this country's inferior investigative techniques probably wouldn't pick up on it anyway.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...That most captivating and beautiful testimony will go down in the Supreme Court's history. Thank you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Easy does it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brett:
I hope that this is the last time I will have to sully my lips with the coarse tones of your unbecoming tongue. <i>Oh</i>.... Forgive me. I do hope I haven't insulted anyone.
</line><line>Auchi:
Not at all, not at all! It is a delight merely to hear you speak, dear lady! And it seems very clear from your testimony, that this boorish talk of the victim's burn is utterly irrelevant.
</line><line>Brett:
I will be speaking to your country's Minister of Justice about what has happened here today.
</line><line>Auchi:
The...Minister of Justice...?
</line><line>Brett:
May that irritating little bully of a student be given the harshest punishment possible! ...<i>Amen.</i>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh? ...Um, thanks? <textEffects>(Was, was that a prayer then?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well you'll have to forgive the irritation, Miss Brett, and put up with a cross-examination now. 
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I expect you've noticed that this 'little bully of a student', as you put it... ...doesn't miss much.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sure I don't need to remind you, Counsel, that this will be your final cross-examination in this trial. If you fail to demonstrate any problems with this witness's testimony... ...I will be ruling on the case immediately. Is that clear?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Judge:
Then you may proceed with the cross-examination!

What is this? The bottle of water? 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Actually, there is one method of killing a man without leaving a trace that comes to mind...
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Obviously, I'm referring...to <textEffects>poison</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
Poison?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
On the day of his death, we know that Dr. Wilson drank from this bottle of carbonated water. Could it be...that there was poison inside?
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Could it be that the professor actually died after taking a sip from his glass?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And on that day, who was sitting at the same table as the professor and able to slip the poison into his drink? There's only person <i>[sic]</i> who could possibly have done it! Jezaille Brett! It was you!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Where did that come from? She, she just snapped!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brett:
I'm afraid I may have spoken unfairly before. I offer my most humble apologies.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, my lady, to what are you referring?
</line><line>Brett:
I described your police force as 'inferior'. But no matter how inferior they may be, you still investigated this particular point thoroughly, I believe? The bottle, I mean, Inspector. And whether it contained <textEffects>poison</textEffects> or not.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... Of course.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You, you did?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Have you forgotten what my guiding principle is already? I strive for a flawless investigation every time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't believe it...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Naturally we <textEffects>tested</textEffects> the inside of the bottle and its contents.
</line><line>Judge:
And...? What did you find, Inspector?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I ordered tests for every toxin that's available in this country at the present time. We could find no trace of poison of any description in the bottle of carbonated water, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Kazuma:
What? Are you sure?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The tests were meticulously carried out by the Chief Coroner himself.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Brett:
I'm very grateful to all you Japanese. You've successfully established my complete innocence in this horrid affair. Thank you.
</line><line>Auchi:
But, but of course, dear lady! The pleasure was all ours!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(I was so sure...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
This...can't be right! Everything falls into place if he was poisoned...!
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. I think that cross-examination has clarified everything. As the prosecution have asserted, a shot to the chest from this gun is the only conceivable cause of death. Furthermore... The accused, who by his own admission was holding this weapon, is the only possible culprit!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I'm done for...)</textEffects>

The court wishes to apologise for the great inconvenience this has caused you, Miss Brett.

Judge:
Well? I understand you are the judicial assistant to the defence, but why this sudden ingress into my courtroom? 
</line><line>Auchi:
Ha! A judicial assistant? And a woman, no less! The rules state...that females are not permitted into this court of law other than to testify!
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, I fully understand. I ask only for five minutes of time. I have some vital evidence that I must hand over to the defence.
</line><line>Auchi:
Hah! You're too late, little girl! This trial has already been concluded!
</line><line>Judge:
Five minutes. I will not allow a moment more.
</line><line>Auchi:
But...Your Excellency!
</line><line>Susato:
I am most grateful.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, who exactly are you?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm sorry, there's no time. Please, simply accept this for now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What is it? A report about something... Written in English...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
It's Jezaille Brett's research.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! The Englishwoman's?!
</line><line>Susato:
After the trial resumed earlier, I hurried back to the university. I went to Dr Wilson's laboratory in the medical faculty and...borrowed this paper.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Oh yes, that's right. Miss Brett was studying under the professor, wasn't she?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So...does this <textEffects>research</textEffects> - whatever it is - have something to do with the case?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm afraid I don't know. I haven't been able to listen to the proceedings of the trial myself. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Oh...no, of course not.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
'Special Characteristics of Curare and its Effects on Human Subjects'... Interesting.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
'<textEffects>Curare</textEffects>'? What's that? <textEffects>(I've never heard that word before...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:
Time's up. The prosecution demands the immediate removal of this female trespasser from the courtroom!
</line><line>Susato:
There was too little time for me to read it in detail. But I've summarised what I could on a note just inside the cover. If you think it could be valuable, please cast your eye over it.

</line><line>Judge:
I ask the prosecution and the defence now one last time... ...does either side have any further evidence to present to the court? I presume not, but...
</line><line>Auchi:
The prosecution has made its case convincingly enough already. Nothing more to add, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke, we're out of options here. This really is our very last chance.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. Your Excellency! The defence does have new evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
......... Hm, that look... The unyielding stare of a true Japanese warrior... Well,  Miss Brett?
</line><line>Brett:
Yes, Your Excellency?
</line><line>Judge:
If you wouldn't mind, perhaps you could grace us with your presence a little longer?
</line><line>Brett:
It's a delightful invitation. But I'm afraid... ...it's not so very long until tea time. I'll have to politely decline-
</line><line>Judge:
Forgive me, Miss Brett, it seems I wasn't clear. I realise it was phrased as a question. However... ...I must ask you to treat that as an order.
</line><line>Brett:
......... I've said it many times before, but... The Japanese language makes no sense.
</line><line>Judge:
My apologies, dear lady. So, Counsel... <textEffects>What is this new evidence that demands the court's attention?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Jezaille Brett... ...we understand you were studying under Dr Wilson at Yumei University. Doing research.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Research, by sheer coincidence, perhaps...into <textEffects>a deadly poison</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Auchi:
What?!
</line><line>Judge:
Poison?! Where are you going with this, Counsel?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A toxin known as <textEffects>curare</textEffects>, Your Excellency. Even the slightest amount of this <textEffects>deadly poison</textEffects> entering the body leads to instant death.
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
What, what complete and utter nonsense! Cu-<textEffects>curare</textEffects>, you say? I've never even heard of it!
</line><line>Kazuma:
You wouldn't have done.
</line><line>Auchi:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Kazuma:
I mean that you wouldn't have heard of curare before for one very simple reason... It doesn't exist in our country.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It <textEffects>doesn't exist</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Correct. Which means... ...no matter what tests the police can do for toxins, they'd never identify curare. Why? Because there IS <textEffects>no test</textEffects> available here that can identify the presence of this highly deadly poison! 
</line><line>Auchi:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Counsel, does this deadly poison truly exist?
</line><line>Kazuma:
According to this report authored by the visiting research student from England... ...curare has long been used by the tribespeople of South America as <textEffects>a poison to lace their arrows</textEffects>. It seems that it's reasonably well known among European doctors and scientists.
</line><line>Auchi:
To, to lace their arrows...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
The report states that it is produced from the extract of a tree that grows deep in the Amazonian jungle. And it was first brought back to Europe at the turn of the century by explorers. It claims that animals shot by arrows laced with curare suffer <textEffects>instant</textEffects> death. Doesn't that about sum it up, Miss Brett? 
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
Trumpery! These aspersions are utter trumpery! To start with! If the victim had been administered some of this so-called deadly poison... ...he would have been squirming and writhing in pain and the other diners would have surely noticed!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, that's true. What do you say to that, Inspector?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Obviously I would have noticed a disturbance like that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Hm, I don't remember anything like that, either. I didn't notice the professor being in any kind of pain...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
According to this, however...it's <textEffects>the other way around</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
What do you mean, '<textEffects>the other way around</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Kazuma:
The very fact that the victim didn't show any visible signs of distress... ...is <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that curare was used.
</line><line>Judge:
Explain yourself, Counsel.
</line><line>Kazuma:
The moment this toxin enters a person's system, it causes instant paralysis. In other words, afflicted victims lose all strength and are completely <textEffects>unable to move</textEffects>. Even if they were in total agony, there would be no visible signs of pain at all.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
How terrible...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Obviously, if a man lost all strength in his muscles, he'd collapse on the floor. But with a chair under him for support, as Dr Wilson did, the effects could go largely unnoticed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I don't follow, Kazuma. That's just paralysis. I thought the poison caused <textEffects>instant death</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... The full explanation is extremely unpleasant. The poison causes immediate paralysis, as I said, leaving the victim unable to move. But after a short time, the paralysis is so severe, it causes the muscles that control <textEffects>respiration</textEffects> to fail. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Respiration...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
In other words, the actual cause of death...is <textEffects>suffocation</textEffects>. And all the while, the victim is conscious and aware. Just unable to move.
</line><line>Auchi:
That's...hideous... 
</line><line>Kazuma:
To the observer, it would look almost like the victim was slipping peacefully into an endless sleep. But for the victim himself, his final moments would be a living hell. That is the true nature of this deadly <textEffects>curare</textEffects> poison.
</line>
<center>.........</center>

Judge:
And you're suggesting that this bottle, Counsel... ...actually contains this terrifying poison?

</line><line>Auchi:
This, this... This is all very convenient, isn't it? A hitherto unknown poison for which there is no means of testing? What a happy tale for the defence!
</line><line>Brett:
Ahem. If I may... 
</line><line>Auchi:
All these 'facts'... You think you're so clever! But you must be taught some manner-

</line><line>Brett:
It is you! ...Who must be taught. 
</line><line>Auchi:
Of, of course... ...dear ladyyyyyyyy! 
</line><line>Brett:
......... So. This is how you Japanese behave, is it? 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? 
</line><line>Brett:
You steal another's honest hard work and then announce the results as if YOU discovered them! I'm appalled! What a loathsome act!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, Miss Brett, the feeling is mutual. 
</line><line>Brett:
Whatever do you mean? 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Capitalising on the unfortunate circumstances of an innocent man to frame him for a heinous crime? That really is a loathsome act. Wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
Enough of this! I, for one, refuse to accept it! The idea of some poison that doesn't even exist in the great Empire of Japan is...is...breaking the rules!
</line><line>Brett:
...Hah hah hah... 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What's so funny?!
</line><line>Brett:
<i>Oh, excuse me</i>. Your...Excellency... 
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, Miss Brett?
</line><line>Brett:
May I borrow that bottle for a moment, please? 
</line><line>Judge:
Um, well... Yes, I don't see, um...why not. 
</line><line>Brett:
Don't get too big for your boots, you insignificant little island boys. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Sorry? 
</line><line>Brett:
To an Englishwoman such as myself, this whole affair is a farcical comedy. Your little police games, and these foolish courtroom antics... It's laughable, really. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Brett:
But I'm getting bored of it all now. It's time for the games to end. ...<i>Cheers!</i>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What! Wha-What are you doing?!
</line><line>Brett:
Hm... No sparkle left at all. How appropriate for this shabby affair.

Brett:
Goodness... Whatever is the matter? You all look quite stunned. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
So...no curare... 'The bottle was clean,' is that what you're saying? 
</line><line>Brett:
Hahahaha... You look quite incredulous, little boy. But of course...that's the simple truth. Thank you for presenting the findings of my research so concisely here in this grand venue. Most kind.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Grrr...
</line><line>Brett:
Thank you, waiter. Now then, Your Excellency... 
</line><line>Judge:
......... Ah! Um, yes, Miss Brett? 
</line><line>Brett:
I should like to be excused now, please. I think I've given more than enough of my time...for the furtherance of friendship between our countries. 
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, yes, dear lady. We are most gratified with all the assistance you have given. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
This doesn't make sense... There had to have been poison in that bottle! So how...? How did she...? How did she swallow a whole glass and live to tell the tale?! I don't understand it... 
</line><line>Brett:
Well, I suppose if nothing else, this little Far Eastern charade... ...will make for interesting conversation at the next party I attend in London.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(There, there has to have been poison in that bottle... doesn't there...? But there can't have been...because otherwise she would have keeled over dead... Come on, Ryunosuke! We have all the clues now. That bottle of water...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The culprit did put curare poison into Dr Wilson's carbonated water! I... The defence refuses to change its position! 
</line><line>Kazuma:
You're serious? 
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
Fool! Are you blind? There is no possible way that bottle could contain poison! I mean, we just saw- 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Brett drinking the water from it? 
</line><line>Brett:
That's right. Which rather <textEffects>complicates</textEffects> your argument, I think. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I believe that 'complication' can be explained! 
</line><line>Auchi:
How, exactly? 
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I need to think through all the things that don't quite add up here. One by one. I'm sure the answer is in the evidence we have in the Court Record somewhere. It has to be!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. If the defence truly intends to assert this claim... 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
...then I must ask you to support the assertion with evidence. <textEffects>What explains how the witness was able to consume this supposedly poisoned water unscathed?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The answer to this riddle...is right here in Miss Brett's own research report!
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a> 
</line><line>Auchi:
That's not a valid explanation! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No?
</line><line>Auchi:
After all... ...we don't speak English! That report is utter gibberish! This impudent young scoundrel is trying to ridicule the court, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I'm not trying to ridicule anyone... Honest. I'm just reading Susato-san's notes...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I concur. This report is too extensive to be considered in its entirety by the court. You will direct us to the pertinent section, Counsel. <textEffects>Which section of the report reveals the alleged answer to this riddle?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
We've been hearing a lot about this curare poison. And it's left me curious about something...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, it sounds as though indigenous hunters have been using this poison for years and years... ...to lace the heads of the arrows that they shoot at whatever prey they're <textEffects>hunting</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
So we've been led to believe, yes. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And...the point of hunting is to catch prey <textEffects>to eat</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
Get to the point, please! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...if they were to use these laced arrows... ...doesn't that mean there would be traces of <textEffects>poison</textEffects> left in the prey the hunters were going to eat? 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes! Good point! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So surely the hunters wouldn't want to eat their prey, would they? Because then they'd be eating <textEffects>poison</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious, Counsel! No, that would be madness!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I actually found the answer to that conundrum in this research paper here. Under '<textEffects>Special Characteristics</textEffects>', it says this: 'The poison starts to work after entering the body <textEffects>through a wound</textEffects>.'
</line><line>Judge:
Through a wound, you say? I see, that makes sense.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. The mention of that particular detail seemed a little strange to me, though.
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But it all makes sense when you interpret what's written like this: When curare enters the body through an open wound, it has terrifying poisonous effects. However... ...when it enters the body via <textEffects>the mouth</textEffects>, it has no poisonous effects whatsoever!
</line><line>Auchi:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Brett! You authored this research! You knew curare's special characteristics! And you knew! ...That you could make a spectacle of drinking that water without any danger to yourself!
</line><line>Brett:
......... You...meddling...little... ...rapSCALLIOOON!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, Ryunosuke, it turns out... ...you're an even better lawyer than I thought you'd be.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really? <textEffects>(Me...? A lawyer...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Brett:
So...the ill-bred little puppy has a new toy to play with. Some facts he read in a book. But I'm afraid knowledge doesn't suit you, little boy. It only makes you look silly.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Brett:
Your schoolboyish logic has a fatal <textEffects>flaw</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sch-Schoolboyish?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Flaw?
</line><line>Brett:
As even your brain has managed to deduce, curare is safe to ingest. It seems likely that its effects are neutralised by the acidic nature of the gastric succus.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, well...of course! <textEffects>(Gas trick suckers? What are they?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brett:
So, if this lethal poison is completely harmless when drunk... ...the professor wouldn't have died when he swallowed it...would he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah!
</line><line>Auchi:
That's...right...
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious!
</line><line>Brett:
That's basic science. Science that even a schoolboy should be able to understand, no?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in court! Order! The logic holds. If the lady and the professor drank the same poison, they would be affected in the same way.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Are... Are you trying to suggest-
</line><line>Auchi:
Yes! This curare poison is completely <textEffects>irrelevant</textEffects> to the case on trial!
</line><line>Brett:
That's right. Surely even a little cockroach like you could understand something as simple as that!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(What is this, welling up inside me...? I've never felt like this before. It's a sort of <span style="color:#E16935">conviction</textEffects> to break down all the discrepancies... It's so intense. Almost <textEffects>rage</textEffects>-like... And more than anything else, it's an animalistic desire... to take down my <textEffects>prey</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't think so, Miss Jezaille Brett!
</line><line>Brett:
How... How dare you use that tone with me?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You know very well that there is no fatal flaw here. You know exactly why, even though both you and the victim swallowed the same poison... ...you are alive, but Dr Wilson is dead!
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, I'm sure I don't need to remind you... You must provide compelling evidence. As we now know that this poison is completely harmless when ingested... <textEffects>...why would Dr Wilson alone have been killed by the curare?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
As Miss Brett so readily pointed out, she drank the same water as the professor. However...there was a fundamental and fatal <textEffects>difference</textEffects> between the two diners.
</line><line>Judge:
A fatal difference?
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The toxic effects of curare are only felt when the poison enters the body through an open wound. So, for a healthy person with no injuries, drinking it is completely harmless. But... ...what if there was <textEffects>a wound</textEffects> inside the mouth of the person drinking the poisoned water?
</line><line>Auchi:
Inside...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Like the wound you might have... ...if you had just been to the dentist and had a tooth extracted, for example.
</line><line>Auchi:
Ah...
</line><line>Judge:
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Brett! You've acknowledged many times in your testimony already... ...that you were <textEffects>well aware</textEffects> of Dr Wilson's dental appointment that day.
</line><line>Brett:
Agh!
</line><line>Kazuma:
So that's it... You used that knowledge to orchestrate this...
</line><line>Brett:
......... Heh...heh...heh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Is, is she...? ...laughing?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brett:
I don't like to repeat myself, but honestly, I can't resist. These childish courtroom games and your half-baked arguments are all so puerile. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What, what do you mean?
</line><line>Brett:
Don't worry, little schoolboy, you'll find out soon enough. You see, when you leave vital evidence lying around, you never know what might happen to it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No!
</line><line>Brett:
I mean, it could just...slip. Oh dear, how careless of me. I'm afraid some crucial evidence may have just been tragically destroyed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
N... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

<center>What is it? What just happened?</center>
<center>It's the Englishwoman! She just smashed that bottle!</center>
<center>And in the Supreme Court! What a terrible blunder!</center>
<line>
Judge:
Officer! What are you waiting for?! Collect up as much of the water from that broken bottle as possible! At once!
</line><line>Brett:
You're wasting your time. This delightful carpet under my feet here was a gift from the British Empire. I assure you, it will soak up the water beautifully. You have neither the technology nor the presence of mind to recover it. Ah ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
How could you?! You... You won't get away with this!
</line><line>Brett:
You can thump the bench and shout as much as you like, little boy. But I'm afraid we'll never know now, will we? If there really was poison in the bottle...or not.
</line><line>Kazuma:
You...
</line><line>Brett:
And let us not forget... ...we still have some very compelling evidence left intact. Isn't that right, Counsel for the Prosecution?
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh, of course, of course! You're referring to this photographic print, I presume, dear lady?
</line><line>Brett:
That's right. And really, looking at this photograph, it's as clear as day, isn't it? The poor professor was sitting with his back to me. So of course the only person who could have shot him from the front...is the little schoolboy.
</line><line>Kazuma:

</line><line>Kazuma:
No! You killed the victim that day. Using curare. And then, in order to frame Ryunosuke Naruhodo for the crime... ...you waited until he picked up the pistol you'd arranged for him to find on the floor... ...before you shot the professor's dead body in the chest with your own hidden gun! Then, in the confusion that followed, all you had to do was turn the dead professor and his chair around. You see? You had every opportunity to commit this crime!
</line><line>Brett:
Heh...heh...heh... What a wonderful imagination you have, young man.
</line><line>Kazuma:
...!
</line><line>Brett:
A hidden gun, you say? And I shot the professor's dead body, did I? Well, I'm terribly sorry, but...you don't have a shred of evidence.
</line><line>Auchi:
Exactly! And as you have nothing to support your wild claims, the prosecution's stance remains unchanged. The victim, Dr John H. Wilson, was killed by a gunshot to the chest... ...delivered in cold blood by the accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is unbelievable! How can this be happening?! We had her! But now... Is she really going to get away with it? The way she <span style="color:#E16935">destroyed that evidence</textEffects> was obscene!)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes?
</line><line>Kazuma:
We've come this far, but now... Now you're the only one who can finish it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? What do you mean?
</line><line>Kazuma:
We've lost a vital piece of evidence, it's true. So if there are any clues left for us to use now... ...they must be <textEffects>in your head</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(In...my head?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
You told me before that your <textEffects>powers of observation</textEffects> were the one thing you could really depend upon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well yes, that's true, but... <textEffects>(But I didn't manage to notice that this woman was a foreigner with a swan on her head...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
So think back again now. Try to remember every last detail about <textEffects>the scene</textEffects> that day. Everything you saw. Everything you felt. Every <textEffects>colour</textEffects>, every <textEffects>smell</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line>
<center><textEffects>(What I saw... What I felt... Every <span style="color:#E16935">colour</textEffects>... Is Kazuma right? Somewhere in the <textEffects>vibrant</textEffects> memory of this same scene in my head... ...could there be another <textEffects>clue</textEffects> to expose the identity of Dr Wilson's killer?)</span></center>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Actually, Kazuma... ...I think I might have something. Thinking back over everything i saw, I think I might have uncovered another <textEffects>clue</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Haha. You always have something up your sleeve, don't you, Ryunosuke? Come on then! Let's wipe the smug smile off that Englishwoman's face with some evidence!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I can't wait! <textEffects>(It's been niggling me for a while that something <span style="color:#E16935">feels amiss</textEffects> in my memories of that day... Whatever it is could be the key to arriving at <textEffects>the truth</textEffects> about all this...)</span> <textEffects>It's here somewhere. The clue that shows who Dr Wilson's real killer must have been is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector Hosonaga! Answer me this!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... Y-Yes? What is  it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh, he's still miles away. Probably thinking about that bottle being smashed...)</textEffects> As you've said a number of times now, you strive for perfection in your investigations, don't you?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Absolutely!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I wonder, therefore, if perhaps you took anything else from the scene of the crime. Like, for instance, <textEffects>the plate</textEffects> of steak that you took to the victim's table that day?

</line><line>Brett:
Where are you going with this, little boy?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's just <textEffects>a memory</textEffects> that's been troubling me.
</line><line>Brett:
What memory?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I saw the crime shown in this photographic print with my own eyes that day. And I saw that on the wooden base of the plate that the steak was served on... ...was a spattering of <textEffects>blood</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
What?!
</line><line>Brett:
......... Oh really? And what of it? Obviously that must have happened when you shot the professor.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, that can't be the case.
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Take a good look at the photograph, and the relative position of everything there. The plate of steak is almost <textEffects>directly behind</textEffects> the victim. If I'm supposed to have shot Dr Wilson in the chest <textEffects>from the front</textEffects>... ...there's no way that blood from the victim could have ended up <textEffects>directly behind</textEffects> him!
</line><line>Auchi:
Ah!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, yes... For blood to have made it onto the plate, it implies the plate was between the victim and the shooter. Which means the shooter must have been <textEffects>sitting opposite</textEffects> the professor, as you were... ...Jezaille Brett!
</line><line>Brett:
<i>I beg your pardon?!</i>

This...this is beyond ridiculous! Fabricated nonsense! Is the court seriously expected to believe something the accused has apparently just 'remembered' seeing?

</line><line>Hosonaga:
This... This could be the moment that my entire career in the police force has been leading to.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector! You mean...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes! I took the plate! In the interests of <textEffects>preserving evidence</textEffects> from the scene of the crime! I took it, meat and all! And I don't CARE if they call me <textEffects>a crime scene thief</textEffects> because of it!
</line><line>Brett:
You did WHAT?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I took the steak that you had been eating, Miss Brett. I took the steak that the sergeant had been eating. And I did it all...in the name of <textEffects>justice</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then we can find out for sure whether or not there's a bloodstain on Miss Brett's plate! We must examine it! Now!
</line><line>Judge:
Inspector! The court wishes to examine the plate from the victim's table, immediately!
</line>
<center>Yes, siiir!</center>
<hr />
<line>Hosonaga:
Sorry for the delay. Here is what you ordered... The steak.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well? What about the blood? Is there blood on it?!
</line><line>Auchi:
Of course there isn't!
</line><line>Judge:
Quickly, Inspector! The blood, man! Show the court!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Of course. Examine the plate at your leisure.
</line>
<center>...No. No <textEffects>blood</textEffects>... No blood anywhere...</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
But... But no, that's... Impossibleeeeee! <textEffects>(I know I saw it! I'm sure of it! It was right there on the table behind the professor. There was <span style="color:#E16935">blood</textEffects> on the side of the plate!)</span>
</line><line>Brett:
...Heh...heh...heh... What an unbecoming expression, little boy! You see! This is why I always say you can't trust what the Japanese tell you!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Auchi:
Tsk, I couldn't agree more! ...In the case of this disgrace to the empire!
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we may finally have reached a conclusion in this trial.
</line><line>Brett:
<i>Let's hope so</i>. This 'let's pretend' attempt at courtroom proceedings is painful to watch. But I do promise to do my best to forget all about it when it's over.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
Hah! This sorry-looking steak reveals the facts all too clearly! If the sorry-looking accused wishes to examine it again, be my guest!
</line><line><textEffects>The plate of steak has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>

Hm?

Never stop believing in yourself. Keep looking forward, no matter what.

<textEffects>(Believe in myself...? Really? Hm, maybe I should at least <span style="color:#E16935">examine</textEffects> the evidence for myself.)</span>

As the evidence requested by the defence has not been shown to be problematic in any way... ...I presume any further examination of evidence in this trial will be unnecessary. Does the defence have any objection?

The only thing that's shocking here, is your unhealthy fascination with beef steak!

Your Excellency... I think I've made myself clear, haven't I? I will not be able to turn a blind eye to any more unnecessary procrastination in this trial.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, Miss Brett, but we must ensure a thorough examination of the evidence. I will not give a ruling until I'm completely satisfied that all reasonable doubt has been dispelled.

I see... As a newly affirmed ally of my country, that's still your position, is it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you...Your Excellency.

Counsel for the Defence! You will now clearly show the court to what you are alluding! <textEffects>Where precisely on this plate of beef steak is this new clue to be found?</textEffects>

Good, good gracious! That's...

Perhaps, little boy, you should realise that it is you who is irrelevant.

The owner...?

<textEffects>(Yes. It's obvious. There's <span style="color:#E16935">only one person</textEffects> it can belong to.)</span> <textEffects>The owner of the koban that was found underneath the beef steak is...</textEffects>

Obviously, it can only be... ...the antiques dealer and owner of Rasu-tei, Kyurio Korekuta-san!

Kyuri...? As in 'Mr Cucumber-something'? Honestly, these ridiculous Japanese names are quite unfathomable.

Hunting for treasure. Indeed! The Hoei-era koban! My prized coin!

Exploited by the police, we were. Like miserable dogs, forced to bear false witness. And when cast from this courtroom, myself, I became a ruined man in a trice. A worthless, withered antique. Nothing more I have to say. The sun has set on this Rasu-tei shop owner's existence...

WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! That's... Yes... That's it! The one! The very one! The very exact one that it is! The resplendent, splendiferous Hoei treasure that my rusty bones managed to misplace that fateful day!
</line><line>Auchi:
It can't be...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm, as I thought.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Young man! Enlighten this decrepit old fool! Put me out of my misery! Where? Where was my treasure? Where was it dropped?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um... I'm not sure if it was 'dropped' anywhere.
</line><line>Kazuma:
We found your coin sandwiched between a beef steak and its plate, soaking in the seasoned meat's juices.
</line><line>Korekuta:
S-S-S-Sandwiched?! S-S-S-Soaking?! S-S-S-SERIOUSLY?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Clearly, it couldn't have fallen there by accident. Which means...somebody must have <textEffects>hidden</textEffects> it there on purpose.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Somebody <textEffects>concealed</textEffects> my Hoei treasure...between a slab of meat...and a metal plate...? WHO would do such a thing?! Such an unconscionable thing?!
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Excuse me... Could I say something?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course!
</line><line>Judge:
Proceed, Inspector Hosonaga.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... I mentioned this earlier on in the trial, but... ...I was working undercover in the restaurant in order to investigate another case.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, yes, that's right. The secret undercover operation.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
La Carneval is a high-class Western cuisine restaurant. It attracts wealthy diners, including many foreigners. Recently, there's been a run of similarly executed <textEffects>thefts</textEffects> targeting the restaurant's rich clientele. A number of such incidents have been reported to the police bureau.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Wicked crimes indeed.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
We wanted to nip the case in the bud quickly. Especially with so many foreigners being affected.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So that's why you were sent in undercover, is it?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes. I took on the job of waiter at the restaurant in order to flush out <textEffects>the criminal</textEffects>. It seems likely...that this koban incident is the work of the same thief.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, so unbeknownst to us, there was a master thief at work in the restaurant on a regular basis. The place was already the scene of several crimes, it seems.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't know about the master thief part, but... <textEffects>The identity</textEffects> of the person who stole and hid Korekuta-san's koban is all too clear.
</line><line>Auchi:
What?
</line><line>Korekuta:
WHAT?!
</line><line>Judge:
I think the court would like to hear the defence's view on this matter. <textEffects>Tell us, who is the despicable scoundrel that stole Korekuta-san's koban and hid it under the steak!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Obviously...it can only be you... ...Sergeant Iyesa Nosa!
</line><line>Nosa:
Wha...? How... How dare you, you, you... You monster!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Monster?
</line><line>Nosa:
I stole that koban, did I? I'm the master thief of La Carneval, am I? You're seriously accusing ME of these crimes, cadet? But it wasn't me. It was Aido! Aido is the mastermind behind all this!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You would push the blame for your crimes onto your own son, an innocent little baby?! It's you who's the monster, Sergeant Nosa!
</line><line>Nosa:

<line>UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClippety-clop, clippety-clop, clippety-clop, clippety-clop, clippety-clop, clippety-clop!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Nippon Imperial Army, Sergeant Iyesa Nosa, preparing to stand down in the Supreme Court, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nosa:
Do any of you know... ...of the extraordinarily low wages the Nippon Imperial Army pays those it expects to keep our country safe?
</line><line>Judge:
I understand that the temporary increase in taxation owing to the recently ended conflicts remains in place. And I have heard it's hard for lower ranking soldiers to make a living, yes.
</line><line>Nosa:
All I want...is to put a hot meal on the table for my son!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's why you were stealing things at the restaurant?
</line><line>Nosa:
The place is heaving with money! Every three days, I'd go there and do reconnaissance for a target. And I'd enjoy chomping my way through a good steak at the same time!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It sounds like he doesn't bother with a knife and fork, even. Which...is worryingly believable...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
And your 'target' that day was the old man and his koban?
</line><line>Nosa:
......... Yes...sir. He...was an easy mark. I...slipped the coin into my pocket without any trouble at all.
</line><line>Korekuta:
Hmmm... A veritable phantom thief, you are...
</line><line>Nosa:
I was all set to leave the steak I was halfway through devouring, when it happened.
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, when the professor was shot.
</line><line>Nosa:
I knew that if the police conducted a search and found the coin in my pocket, I'd be finished. Aido, too. So I hid the incriminating evidence as fast as I could. On the double! I slipped it under the steak...hoping that I'd be able to rendezvous with it again at a later date.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:

Brett:
Perhaps you could carry on with this absurd prattling in your own time?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, Miss Brett-
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh, of course, dear lady, of course! How rude of us! I'm quite sure there's no need to detain you any longer at all. May the esteemed gentlewoman PLEASE be excused, Your Excellency?!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, indeed... The theft of the koban was clearly perpetrated by this... 'baby-saddled' sergeant. It would certainly appear to be unrelated to Dr Wilson's <textEffects>murder</textEffects>.
</line><line>Brett:
Of course it is. Hiding a coin under a lump of meat? The sheer nonsense of such an idea astounds me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
N-Nonsense, is it...?
</line><line>Nosa:
Ah, um...well... Oof...
</line><line>Brett:
And as for picking up your steak and biting into it without using a knife and fork... It's beyond nonsense. It's pure madness!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Now that all questions concerning this witness's testimony have been answered... ...I see no further justification for detaining her. Miss Brett, you are free to leave.
</line><line>Brett:
Thank you, Your Excellency. Good luck, everyone. ...<i>And good day</i>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke! What's the matter with you? This is no time for daydreaming!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! No, it's just... ...something about Miss Brett's <textEffects>parting words</textEffects> there got me thinking. <textEffects>(I can't quite work out what exactly. But something she said jarred with me. I feel like there was <span style="color:#E16935">a contradiction</textEffects> in there somewhere. Something didn't quite add up...)</span>
</line><line>Kazuma:
If that's the case, don't just stand there thinking! Make your voice heard!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Kazuma:
You can think later. But if you don't call out now, it'll be too late. The trial will be over!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! Miss Brett!
</line><line>Brett:
What is it now?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid...just one last time... There's something I'd like to ask you. I'd like you to explain <textEffects>the contradiction</textEffects> in your parting words from just a few moments ago.
</line><line>Brett:
What are you talking about? What contradiction?
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Auchi:
What new student nonsense is this?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well? What <textEffects>parting words</textEffects> are you talking about, Ryunosuke?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Brett:
Hiding a coin under a lump of meat? The sheer nonsense of such an idea astounds me. And as for picking up your steak and biting into it without using a knife and fork... It's beyond nonsense. It's pure madness!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, I'm right. What she said there exposed an undeniable <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
I'm going to need to see evidence, Counsel. <textEffects>If Miss Brett's words truly are contradictory, where is the evidence to prove it?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Judge:
The steak that Miss Brett had been eating before the professor was killed, yes. Go on.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
More accurately, Your Excellency... ...the steak that was <textEffects>on the victim's table</textEffects> just before the professor was killed.
</line><line>Auchi:
Now you're just splitting hairs!
</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Not true. Doesn't something about this steak strike you as very <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects>?
</line><line>Auchi:
'<textEffects>Unnatural</textEffects>'? What on earth do you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's extremely obvious. I'm talking about <textEffects>the shape of the edge where it's been eaten</textEffects>.
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I see you've noticed it too, Miss Brett.
</line><line>Judge:
Noticed what exactly, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Just a few moments ago, Miss Brett claimed... ...no Englishman could even contemplate picking up a steak and biting into it without using a knife and fork.
</line><line>Auchi:
Of course she did! She's a refined English gentlewoman herself!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then take a good look at this steak. In particular, <textEffects>the edge where it's been eaten</textEffects>. As you can see, there are clearly defined 'barbaric' <textEffects>teeth marks</textEffects> there!
</line><line>Auchi:
Ah!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh!
</line><line>Brett:
......... ...<i>Ah!</i>
</line><line>Kazuma:
It looks like Miss Brett has realised something.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So! If the witness, as she claims, wouldn't contemplate eating anything without using a knife and fork... ...there shouldn't be <textEffects>teeth marks</textEffects> in the steak at all!
</line><line>Auchi:

But... What is your actual point? Perhaps the delightful Miss Brett was ravenously hungry and couldn't help her-

</line><line>Brett:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
Oh, um... Whatever you say, dear lady!
</line><line>Brett:
As I said, I really must be leaving now. Afternoon tea with the Minister of Justice cannot possibly wait any longer.
</line><line>Auchi:
Of course, of course! This will all be over in the blink of an eye! Rest assured, I'm about to put this rookie in his place! Just leave everything to-

</line><line>Brett:
I've heard enough... You irritating little spectacled samurai relic!
</line><line>Auchi:
Of, of course...dear ladyyyyyyyy!
</line><line>Kazuma:
What's the matter, Miss Brett? Have we ruffled your feathers?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Clearly, the witness knows what this means. She's realised the catastrophic implications these <textEffects>teeth marks</textEffects> in the steak have for her!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke! Do you know where you're going with this?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes. Now at last, it's all come together. The mysterious <span style="color:#E16935">teeth marks</textEffects> in a steak that had allegedly been eaten with cutlery... The reason why <textEffects>the bloodstain</textEffects> I know I saw somehow seems to have disappeared... And most importantly... <textEffects>The evidence</textEffects> that proves once and for all... who shot Dr Wilson that day!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
I accept that these teeth marks in the steak are a little... 'unnatural', as you put it, Counsel. But what exactly are you suggesting that tells us?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...<textEffects>Everything</textEffects>, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Auchi:
Everything?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I believe that these 'barbaric' teeth marks in the steak here... ...amount to conclusive evidence in this case. Evidence that will prove beyond any doubt who shot Dr Wilson!
</line><line>Brett:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/44/Shutup%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420195556" class="image"><img alt="Shutup!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="184" data-image-name="Shutup!.png" data-image-key="Shutup%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/44/Shutup%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420195556" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Brett:
Conclusive evidence? How many times have I heard that today? You wouldn't know the meaning of the phrase! Typical Japanese empty threats!
</line><line>Kazuma:
How can you be so sure?
</line><line>Brett:
Oh, it's quite simple. If you really had such conclusive evidence, you would have presented it to the court long ago!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Actually, the evidence I'm talking about hasn't been brought before the court yet.
</line><line>Auchi:
Hasn't been...? What?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But just because it hasn't been shown yet, doesn't mean that the evidence does not exist.
</line><line>Auchi:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Auchi:
This is absurd! The trial has run several hours already! And you say there's evidence yet to be brought forward? There can't be! I don't believe you have it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't! But there is someone who <textEffects>does have it</textEffects>! Someone in this very courtroom!
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And if that person is willing to submit the piece of evidence I'm referring to... ...it will <textEffects>solve</textEffects> every remaining mystery about this case!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... I have a feeling this will be my last request of the defence in this trial. <textEffects>Who possesses the conclusive evidence that will reveal the truth about this whole affair?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The answer is obvious! It's Inspector Hosonaga!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What?! I, I have it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
You, you think I've been <textEffects>withholding</textEffects> conclusive evidence? That's ridicul- Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, AHEM!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No no no no! I'm not saying that! Everyone's attention has been focused on this steak with <textEffects>the teeth marks</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Now, earlier this afternoon, Sergeant Nosa told the court the following: 'I'd enjoy chomping my way through a good steak.' And as well as admitting to stealing Korekuta-san's coin, he told us that he 'slipped it under the steak.'
</line><line>Nosa:
You, you watch it, cadet! I'm a superior officer!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sergeant Nosa, could you please confirm something for me? Was the steak that you put the coin under... in fact, your own steak?
</line><line>Nosa:
Teeen-shun! Affirmative, of course! I might be a soldier in the Imperial Nippon Army, but still... ...I'm not brave enough to ask a foreign gentlelady if she'd mind me manhandling her meal to hide something in it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In other words, the steak that the detective submitted as evidence earlier... ...was in fact Sergeant Nosa's meal.
</line><line>Auchi:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yet the gentlewoman doesn't take bites out of her steak, nor did she have any opportunity to steal the coin.
</line><line>Brett:
Of course I didn't steal it! To even suggest such a thing would be...an affront to the entire British Empire!
</line><line>Judge:
Well then...how do you explain this paradox?
</line><line>Auchi:
Exactly! Surely you're not going to suggest... ...that the sergeant <textEffects>switched</textEffects> the two steaks over?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Nosa:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
......... You DID <textEffects>switch</textEffects> the plates?
</line><line>Nosa:
......... Well...after it happened... The, um...
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Nosa:
When I saw the civilian had been murdered right in front of my eyes like that, I panicked. As I said, I immediately lifted my steak and hid the coin underneath it. But then when the waiter announced he was an undercover policeman, I thought I'd had it! If he decided to investigate my slab of meat, that'd be it. I'd be getting my marching orders! So when the cadet here was arrested and taken off to the kitchen, I seized my chance. With military precision and timing...I switched my steak with the one on the foreign lady's table!
</line><line>Brett:
What?! You can't have! I, I never saw you do such a thing!
</line><line>Nosa:
It was called 'Operation Lightning Bolt'. There was no time for strategic planning. It was do or die, I tell you! So yes! I did what had to be done!
</line><line>Auchi:
Un... Unbelievableeeeeeeee!
</line><line>Nosa:
However! Fear not, Prosecutor-san!
</line><line>Auchi:
What now?
</line><line>Nosa:
I swear on the brass buttons of my uniform... that is all I did! Sir!
</line><line>Auchi:
'All you did'?! That's plenty, Sergeant!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, if Sergeant Nosa switched the plates over... ...it means he took Miss Brett's steak - and the plate it was on - back to <textEffects>his own table</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that follows.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector Hosonaga!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Earlier in this trial, you told the court this: You said that you had not only taken Miss Brett's steak after the incident, but also the sergeant's. That to preserve evidence, you had taken <textEffects>both</textEffects>.
</line><line>Auchi:
Ah!
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That's correct.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then please present it to the court now. The plate that was actually on the victim's table at the precise moment he was shot!
</line><line>Brett:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/44/Shutup%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420195556" class="image"><img alt="Shutup!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="184" data-image-name="Shutup!.png" data-image-key="Shutup%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/44/Shutup%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420195556" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Brett:
What can that possibly tell us now? I mean, a cold slab of tough meat? It can't have the slightest bearing on the case!
</line><line>Kazuma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kazuma:
No! You're not wriggling your way out of it this time, lady!
</line><line>Brett:
I, I beg your pardon...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Surely you're not that forgetful. Surely you remember <textEffects>the reason</textEffects> why this steak pan promises to prove such a problem for you...no?
</line><line>Brett:
Hmph! You're the ones who decided it was a problem, not me.
</line><line>Kazuma:
<textEffects>The reason</textEffects> the defence asked to see that plate was to confirm something the defendant remembers seeing.
</line><line>Brett:
Tsk! THINKS he remembers!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm quite sure of <textEffects>what I saw</textEffects>, Miss Brett. On the side of the plate that was on the table directly behind Dr Wilson... ...there was a clear spattering of <textEffects>blood</textEffects> from the gunshot wound to the victim's chest. 
</line><line>Kazuma:
I believe the defendant's memory serves him well.
</line><line>Brett:
...!
</line><line>Kazuma:
And now we have the evidence to prove it! The plate you were eating from, Miss Brett!
</line><line>Judge:
Let us not prolong this any further. Inspector, you will show the evidence to the court. Present the beef steak and plate that was originally on the victim's table at the time of the incident!
</line>
<center>Yes, siiir!</center>
<hr />
<line>Hosonaga:
Sorry for keeping you. Here is the other steak and its plate. Please, feel free to examine it.
</line>
<center><textEffects>The bloodstain</textEffects>... It's clearly visible, look!</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Now this makes everything clear. <textEffects>The blood</textEffects> you can see on the side of the plate... ...shows that at the moment the victim was shot, he was facing the table, <textEffects>with his back to me</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kazuma:
In other words! It's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects> for Naruhodo-san to have shot the victim!
</line><line>Brett:
Agh!
</line><line>Auchi:
It, it can't be...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In fact, there's only one person who could possibly have shot Dr Wilson from <textEffects>the front</textEffects>. I'm sure everyone knows by now who that person is.
</line><line>Brett:
...Ugh...um...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right... <textEffects>Miss Jezaille Brett</textEffects>... It's you!
</line><line>Brett:
......... Outdone...by a Japanese? Me? By a Japanese schoolboy? No... No... NO...
</line>
<center>KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</center>
<hr />
<line>Brett:
Please excuse my...little outburst. I briefly lost my composure. Most unbecoming behaviour for an English gentlewoman. Forgive me.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Miss Brett... ...I think it's time you told the court what actually happened that day. The truth, this time.
</line><line>Brett:
......... Gladly, Your Excellency.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Brett:
...It was I who took the professor's life, using curare. As you surmised, I chose that particular day for one very important reason... The professor had a dental appointment for the extraction of one of his teeth in the morning.
</line><line>Kazuma:
So you planned to kill the professor, knowing that no trace of poison would be found in his water. Because curare is unheard of here in Japan.
</line><line>Brett:
Yes. Of course, I never intended to remain at the restaurant for as long as I did. I only needed to see the professor take one tiny sip of his water, and it would be all over. I would place the steak I had ordered in front of him to make it appear as though he had been dining alone... ...and leave immediately. However... ...before any of that happened, there was an unexpected visitor at the professor's table.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That would be me...I suppose?
</line><line>Brett:
Yes, you. Who else? Such a trifling matter. But the fact that you'd decided to come over to greet the professor... ...meant that I had lost my chance to slip away unnoticed. In due course, the professor took a sip of his water and was paralysed. I made sure he was sitting in his chair such that he wouldn't fall.
</line>
<center>There was no going back at that point. So I concocted <textEffects>a plan</textEffects> on the spur of the moment.</center>
<line>
Kazuma:
A plan to pin Dr Wilson's murder on this innocent man.
</line><line>Brett:
......... I happened to know that the professor always carried a gun. I decided to use that fact to my advantage. I had the bottle of curare in my handbag. And...my own <textEffects>pistol</textEffects> concealed under my skirt.
</line><line>Auchi:
U-Under you <i>[sic]</i> skirt...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So I was right. There were two guns.
</line><line>Brett:
...<i>Yes</i>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And then I finished my coffee and got up to leave. That's when I noticed the professor's gun, which you had presumably placed on the floor. Placed where you were sure that I would notice it.
</line><line>Brett:
And everything went according to plan. You noticed the gun, as I'd intended. And then, just as you bent down to pick it up...
</line>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
That's when you shot the professor with your own gun. Even though at that point, he was already dead.
</line><line>Brett:
Naturally, the gunshot caused a commotion, at which point the waiter appeared.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Obviously, I assumed Naruhodo-san was the culprit and apprehended him. I took him to the pantry that adjoins the kitchen and locked him inside.
</line><line>Brett:
That's when I took the opportunity to turn the professor and his chair around.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Because, of course... ...you needed to make it look like the defendant had shot Dr Wilson from where he'd picked up the gun.
</line>
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Brett:
...So there you have it. That is the entirety of my...misdemeanour.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Auchi:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Brett:
Your Excellency...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes?
</line><line>Brett:
I wonder... ...might I speak with you in private later?
</line><line>Judge:
I shall call on you.
</line><line>Brett:
Thank you. Good day then, everyone. I hope you can forgive me...Naruhodo-san.
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem... ...this trial has finally run its course. I presume the prosecution is in agreement?
</line><line>Auchi:
This, this can't be... Taketsuchi Auchi does not lose! Not to the likes of this, this...ROOKIE STUDENT!
</line><line>Kazuma:
You'd better start getting used to tough opposition.
</line><line>Auchi:
ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha- Yes?
</line><line>Auchi:
This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!
</line><line>Kazuma:
You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that! A thousand millenia may pass, and still the Auchi clan will never measure up to the Naruhodo clan!
</line><line>Judge:
This trial, in the Supreme Court of Japan... ...will, I believe, go down in history as the start of a new chapter in our country's judicial system. Despite being summoned as the accused, you, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, presented an excellent case.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I... Thank you, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Judge:
The use of evidence and deduction to unravel the truth is a modern methodology. After all, it has only been a few short decades since our country opened its doors to the wider world. But the Western ideas of '<textEffects>science</textEffects>' are rapidly gaining acceptance here. I feel sure that science will soon bring new methods of investigation, and new procedures of justice. A new future of law awaits. But what it will look like, I cannot begin to imagine. That is for the young to pursue. Kazuma Asogi...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
After this trial, you are set to embark on a journey of discovery, to the illustrious British Empire. Learn all you can. Absorb everything of the wider world that you are able to. And do not forget...to fulfil <textEffects>the mission</textEffects> imposed upon you.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... I understand...Your Excellency.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What was that about? Why do you look so grave all of a sudden?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ah... Never mind.
</line><line>Judge:
As for you, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
In you, I sense - how can I put it? - unusual potential. I very much look forward to seeing how you carry that onwards.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Your Excellency!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It is time to deliver the final verdict. I hereby find the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
This court is now adjourned!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>22nd November, 2:46 p.m.
Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 5</textEffects></center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I can't believe it. I can't believe what's happened. I made it! I defended myself and made it through that horrendous trial!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ryunosuke! You finally pulled it off! Congratulations!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Kazuma.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! No no, it was a pleasure to watch you at work. So, you owe me an extra large sukiyaki from the place on Yumei University Street. Don't forget!
</line><line>???:
Good afternoon. All your hard work has certainly paid off.
</line><line>Susato:
Congratulations to both of you for proving Naruhodo-san's innocence.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ah, our trusty judicial assistant. You worked hard for that result, too, you know.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh no. I didn't do anythi-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you so much! If we hadn't had that research paper of Miss Brett's, I don't know how things would have turned out.
</line><line>Susato:
Your kind words should really be for my father. I was simply doing as he asked. It was his idea for me to go to the university and investigate.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your father...? <textEffects>(Ah yes, of course...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
Forgive me for intruding on court proceedings, Your Excellency.
</line><line>Susato:
<textEffects>Susato Mikotoba</textEffects>, judicial assistant to the defence.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Speaking of <span style="color:#E16935">Mikotoba</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>???:
Ah, there you are. I believe congratulations are in order!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Naruhodo... You did an excellent job.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Th-Thank you, Professor.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Oh no, it is I who should be thanking you. After all... ...your efforts exposed the true criminal that took the life of my good friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>('<span style="color:#E16935">Good friend</textEffects>'?)</span> Oh yes, you mentioned that before. It was you who actually invited Dr Wilson to Yumei University, wasn't it?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes, that's right.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Professor Mikotoba studied overseas himself. He went to study forensic medicine in Great Britain. Presumably that's when you met Dr Wilson?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Exactly. In those days, we worked together in the same hospital.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, you worked together?
</line><line>Kazuma:
I've never heard you mention that before.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, it was a long time ago now. Besides... ...it's your turn, Asogi.
</line><line>Kazuma:
...!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Great Britain is a magnificent country. It leads the world. In science, medicine, engineering, culture... And, of course, in law. Watch and learn, my boy. See what's happening in the world's largest melting pot!
</line><line>Kazuma:
I will. I'll learn all that I can. I swear on this, <textEffects>the spirit</textEffects> of the Asogi clan!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're not taking that sword to Great Britain, are you?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Of course I am. A Japanese man's katana is his soul. This blade shows me where I need to go. And cuts down anything that's in my way.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, I've definitely seen how sharp it is already with my own eyes...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
That reminds me, what's happened to the woman? To Jezaille Brett, I mean. After all, she's guilty of murder.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Ah yes, her. It's not easy to tell you this, but...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean? Surely she's going to face trial herself now. She's the true culprit, after all.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
She will be leaving Japan in the very near future. For Shanghai.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? Shanghai?
</line><line>Kazuma:
.........
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Jezaille Brett will not appear in court again in this country. I'm certain of that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? But why not?
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>It's a matter of <textEffects>consular jurisdiction</textEffects>.</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Hosonaga!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It was a hard-fought battle in the courtroom today. Very impressive to watch. I must congratula-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But, but what's all this about <textEffects>consular jurisdiction</textEffects>?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
We cannot try this particular foreigner for her crimes here in Japan.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What...? We <textEffects>can't try</textEffects> her? But then, who? Who's going to bring her to justice?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A British consular court will hear her case. Somewhere far away, where our voices can't be heard.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(But why a consular court...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kazuma:
Professor, I simply don't understand. I thought consular courts were <textEffects>a thing of the past</textEffects> now that we've signed <textEffects>the friendship treaty</textEffects>.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes, in normal circumstances, you're right.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Then, so long as this is not <textEffects>a serious incident</textEffects> of a highly political nature to our respective governments... ...they can't invoke a consular court just like that!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh... Can't they?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, she's a student, but it doesn't justify our governments making <textEffects>secret agreements</textEffects> about her fate, does it? Something strange is going on!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So Miss Brett <span style="color:#E16935">can't be held accountable</textEffects> for her actions here in Japan...)</span>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
I'm afraid that for the young student... ...today's trial was nothing more than <textEffects>a game</textEffects> all along. There was never any danger of comeuppance for her.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't believe it...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The British government's foreign affairs ministry has demanded that we hand over custody of Miss Brett. They're obviously taking this case of a foreign student committing murder very seriously.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
......... But it's all going to change from now on. We can make it change. This is a time of great turmoil, this new era heralded by the start of the twentieth century. One day, I have no doubt... ...that woman will receive the judgment she deserves.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, change is coming. And we're the ones driving it.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, I think that's enough seriousness for now. This evening calls for a celebratory drink!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But Professor...
</line><line>Kazuma:
You're right. This is no time for gloomy faces! We should be celebrating Ryunosuke's not guilty verdict! Let's start having some fun!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
In that case, might I suggest La Carneval? As the head waiter, I should be delighted to provide you with ample food and drink!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...you're a detective, Hosonaga-san. ...Aren't you?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ahem! Ahem! Let's not worry about details for now. To La Carneval! Will you accompany us, Professor?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Of course! La Carneval's food is second to none!
</line><line>Susato:
I shall go and attend to the paperwork for Naruhodo-san's release.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes... Thank you. <textEffects>(So Jezaille Brett won't be tried here. I, I suppose that means I'll never know. I'll never find out why she killed Dr Wilson...)</textEffects> Kazuma...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, Ryunosuke?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I just wanted to say thanks again, that's all. You really saved my skin today.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! I didn't do a thing! You were the lawyer in there, weren't you? That defence was all your own work.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your skills made the difference, though. One day, I bet you'll be the best lawyer in the world.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Hm, I'm not so sure about that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
To be honest, something kept occurring to me over and over again during that trial. I couldn't help thinking that maybe you're the one destined to become a great lawyer, not me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Come on, be serious!
</line><line>Kazuma:
If I helped you today, it was only right at the very start of the trial. But you have a natural talent for it. For being a defence lawyer, I mean.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no! Not me! All that tense verbal combat? I never want to go through that ever again! I just... I did what you told me to do, that's all. Because I knew I could trust you.
</line><line>Kazuma:
That's the point.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean, '<textEffects>that's the point</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Listen, Ryunosuke... Do you know what the most crucial weapon is that any lawyer needs in order to win?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...knowledge of the law?
</line><line>Kazuma:
No. The ability to <textEffects>believe</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
To believe? To believe what?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A defence lawyer has to fight for his clients. He has to believe in them at all times.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Like you believed in me when I said I didn't do it.
</line><line>Kazuma:
I'm human, just like you. I don't have some superhuman ability to know the truth. But you have to make a choice about what to believe in and stick to it when you're defending someone. Sometimes in the courtroom, you can really be backed into a corner. But being able to remain faithful to what you chose to believe in even then... Well, that's not something that anyone can do. It takes a special kind of person.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm, believing in your client...
</line><line>Kazuma:
Just look at today's trial. I'm a student lawyer with precious little real experience, but you never stopped believing in me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, I...
</line><line>Kazuma:
You faced seemingly hopeless situations time and again, but you never stopped looking for the truth. And in the end, you found it. Through your own efforts. And because you never stopped believing in me. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thanks, Kazuma.
</line><line>Kazuma:
......... There's something I want to ask you, actually, Ryunosuke. Well, it's <textEffects>a favour</textEffects>, really. Something very important to me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It sounds serious. What is-
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah! You're still here, are you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Inspector Hosonaga!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I've arranged some rickshaws for us. Let's go!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Thank you. We'll be right there. Let's pick up this conversation again later. We should be celebrating right now. Your first court victory!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And YOUR study tour to Great Britain, don't forget!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ah yes. That too.
</line>
<hr />
<center>So my very first trial came to an end. Kazuma... Professor Mikotoba... Susato-san, who acted as my assistant... Inspector Hosonaga...who didn't really play much of a part, but still... It was because of the help and support of all these people that I managed to get through that trial. But more importantly... Kazuma hadn't yet managed to ask his <textEffects>favour</textEffects> of me. Little did I realise... ...just how much it would change my life.</center>
