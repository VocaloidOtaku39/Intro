<line>Edgeworth:
This dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra! It's likely that the killer got the candelabra from this very storeroom.
</line><line>Ema:
Does that mean... the candelabra was also a piece of evidence?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's quite possible. However, that is not the issue here. The murder weapon originally came from this storeroom. We must keep that in mind.

<line>Edgeworth:
The Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her... Perhaps it was originally attached to this hook!
</line><line>Ema:
That sounds plausible. Scientifically speaking. In other words... Kay came here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's quite likely. But... for what purpose?
</line><line>Ema:
Maybe she was going to steal something from this place.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A Great Thief who steals the truth, huh...)</textEffects> No, I don't think we can answer that question at this time.

<line>Edgeworth:
This statue...!
</line><line>Ema:
Yes, is it some sort of new fact?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... this is evidence from a case that I was previously involved in. <textEffects>(I believe it was called the "Alice Red" statue. There were supposed to be two of them, one real and one fake, but... ...no matter which one this is, it's unnatural for it to turn up in a place like this.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth, you've really seen a lot of cases..... huh?
</line><line>???:
Gotchaaaaaa! Yippee-ki-yay! I got me a scoooooop!
</line><line>Ema:
Eeeeek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gah... my eyes...! Stop it!
</line><line>Lotta:
Ya ain't gettin' away from the Great Lotta's camera that easily! I reckon y'all must be criminals! I'ma snap 16 shots before y'all can even say "Cheese!"
</line><line>Ema:
We're not criminals!
</line><line>Lotta:
...Really? Ya ain't foolin' my camera of justice with those words!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm, you are...
</line><line>Lotta:
Huuh? Yer... Ain't ya that heinous prosecutor from back then!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who are you calling heinous!? <textEffects>(This is Lotta Hart... She's a photographer I've dealt with during my past cases. I see her distinctive accent and her chatterbox mouth haven't changed a bit.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
Just look at that face! Yer obviously up to no good!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems she has a bad impression of us.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
Now it's time to pay yer dues! Stand still while I photograph y'all!
</line><line>Ema:
We only came here to investigate...
</line><line>Lotta:
Lies! Ya think ya can fool me like that?
</line><line>Ema:
...Mr. Edgeworth. She's not listening at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...She seems harmless. Let's just leave her be, for now.

<line>Edgeworth:
You said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?
</line><line>Lotta:
That's right. They sure looked spiffy for a criminal mastermind.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart, did they look anything like this?
</line><line>Lotta:
Heeeey! That's it! That's the Conductor! ...H-H-Hold yer horses! Are ya tellin' me the Conductor is dead!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She is the victim of a case we are investigating.
</line><line>Ema:
Her name is Jill Crane. Have you heard of her?
</line><line>Lotta:
Can't say I have... So, she was a lady, huh. What kinda gal dresses like that? She get her kicks by foolin' me into thinkin' she's a guy!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I doubt that her intention was to deceive you... Setting that aside... We have established something of major importance. The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
I see... so the Conductor was killed. Then that might explain...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Explain what, Ms. Hart?
</line><line>Lotta:
Ah! N-No, no, no! It's nothin', honest!
</line><line>Ema:
Ms. Hart... You clearly sounded suspicious just now.
</line><line>Lotta:
And I'm tellin' ya, I ain't! Hmm, can't be...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Sorry, were you trying to say something?
</line><line>Lotta:
No, I ain't! I ain't said nothin'!
</line><line>Ema:
Please don't be like that. Just tell us.
</line><line>Lotta:
How many times do I gotta tell y'all? I'm a journalist! Information is what pays the bills. I can't just go around spoutin' everything I know! I've already said too much! I got nothin' left to say to y'all!
</line><line>Ema:
Th-Then! What if I found some fingerprints for you?
</line><line>Lotta:
Wh-What good would that do me!? I don't want none of yer dusty old prints! Why don't you two follow my example, and do some investigatin' on yer own!
</line><line>Ema:
Ooh... I guess she won't tell us anything.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not to worry, Ema. Just leave it to me. I have a certain method of drawing out information from those who wish to hide it. If my opponent's lips are sealed, I will be the one to unseal them. Let us begin.

<line>Edgeworth:
First, let's analyze my opponent's demeanor...

<textEffects>(She seems rather <span style="color:#E16935">impatient</textEffects>. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation.)</span> I must be careful with my time...

<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Lotta:
A real journalist... always keeps her cool.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Speaking of journalists... I have something interesting to tell you. A few days ago, I met another self-proclaimed journalist. She spoke with an accent quite similar to your own...
</line><line>Lotta:
S-She spoke like me? Then, maybe it was...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
...Nicole Swift. She had a distinct way of speaking. One very much like your own. Furthermore, she said that she had a mentor... Could she have been referring to you?
</line><line>Lotta:
O-Oh! So you know Nicole? Weeell, ain't that a fun little coincidence! Where'd y'all meet? Wait... No, no! Stop tryin' to get me to spill the beans! Phew, that was a close call.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

<line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps I should use that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You say I have no connection with you, Ms. Hart? But, don't we have a mutual acquaintance with your apprentice?
</line><line>Lotta:
Ulp! W-Well, that's... I reckon it would be mighty cruel of me... ...to give Nicole's friends the cold shoulder...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then, why don't you share with us what you know?
</line><line>Lotta:
Well, when ya put it like that... I guess I could let you in on my scoo... N-No! I ain't fallin' for your nasty tricks! No siree!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your "scoo"?
</line><line>Lotta:
N-No, just forget it. It ain't nothin' important...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Such a slip of the tongue... It's hardly becoming of a journalist. You have a scoop, don't you? Now, tell us what it is!
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Lotta:
Aagh! A-Alright... Ya got me. I had me a perfect scoop... But I ain't tellin' you what it is! I'm gonna sell the story to a publisher!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The information she is hiding could be vital to the investigation. I need to make her talk. Next, I will press her on the <textEffects>contents of her scoop</textEffects>. She may be quick to lose her temper, but she's even quicker to loosen her tongue. She is not a different opponent. Now, to extract the information I need.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
You didn't hear... What, exactly? Did you hear something during the auction?
</line><line>Lotta:
Um, no, that's... I just heard a weird sound, is all. It ain't even worth mentionin' in my article. J-Just forget about it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There's no question. <span style="color:green">Something happened during the black market auction</textEffects>. She heard a strange sound... This could be a useful <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.)</span>

<line>Edgeworth:
You didn't do anything wrong? That's a bold statement... ...considering you're currently trespassing on private property!
</line><line>Lotta:
H-Hey! Yer doin' it too! Well... I guess a prosecutor's got the right to investigate wherever they please...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I probably shouldn't mention anything about the current state of my employment...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
There are far worse people in the world, ya know... *mumble* I reckon I'm a saint... compared to folks who murder...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Considering what you just mumbled... ...is it possible your scoop has something to do with a murder incident?
</line><line>Lotta:
H-Hey, I was... only talkin' in general terms just now! I mean, anyone'd look like a bag o' roses compared to a murderer, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It sounds like you're just making excuses to me...
</line><line>Lotta:
All I did was gather info on the black market auction! A murder incident? I don't know anythin' about that. I ain't seen or heard nothin'!
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps I should use that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Didn't you say you heard something strange during the auction? If it stuck out to you so much, it must not have been a sound that you would normally hear. For example... the screams of a murder victim.
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Lotta:
Ack...! H-How do you keep figurin' everything out so quick? Th-That's right. I stumbled upon a murder in the middle of my stakeout... But please, don't make me say anymore. This is the biggest scoop I've had in a while...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The murder that she overheard... It's most likely the same incident we are currently investigating. This is bound to be crucial information. I'll finish this by confirming the <textEffects>credibility of her information</textEffects>. She has nowhere left to run. It's time to deal the final blow!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps I should use that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I'd hardly expect a "bona fide journalist" to be so inattentive. Didn't you just say your motto is to be faster and more accurate than anyone?
</line><line>Lotta:
Uuugh. W-Well, that's...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I expected, the credibility of your information is suspect.
</line><line>Lotta:
B-But I know what I heard. ...I even got proof...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
You have proof? How is that possible...? Explain yourself at once!
</line><line>Lotta:
I got me some evide... Wait, you heard that!? W-Well... I was just talkin' to myself, y'all just go on and pay it no mind.

<line>Lotta:
I lost... I really lost... The Mouth of South... has been defeated.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, it's time to come clean. Tell me everything that you know.
</line><line>Lotta:
...I was watchin' the auction... Gatherin' info for my story.
</line><line>Ema:
You didn't just watch, though. You got shocking photos too! Right?
</line><line>Lotta:
Uugh... A little while after the auction started... ...someone won a bid, and the Conductor banged the gavel. Someone hollered, "We'll finish the deal upstairs", or somethin' like that. "That ain't good!" I thought to myself, as I hurried back to hide behind the statue.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you see whoever came up?
</line><line>Lotta:
Not quite, but I reckon the feller that came up was the winner of the bid. I could smell the buttery aroma of big, fat wads of cash.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Buttery aroma...? I can't imagine that at all.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
I reckon this room is where the bidders ponied up the dough for their purchases. The two of 'em talked for a while...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait. There was a second person in the storeroom?
</line><line>Lotta:
You betcha. I reckon it was the Conductor. And then outta nowhere, one of them started screamin'!Almost scared my britches off. I rolled myself up into a ball and kept on layin' bow.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you witnessed the murder!
</line><line>Lotta:
Well, I wouldn't say that I witnessed it, but I definitely heard it though.
</line><line>Ema:
Didn't you try to stop them?
</line><line>Lotta:
Just stop right there. That ain't even funny. What's a dainty little thing like me gonna do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Dainty?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
After that, I heard me some rustlin' and bustlin'. The whole time, I was really regrettin' comin' here somethin' fierce.
</line><line>Ema:
Well, yeah, that makes sense. I mean...
</line><line>Lotta:
But nothin' gets in the way of Lotta Hart and her photos!
</line><line>Ema:
........
</line><line>Lotta:
This was my big scoop! Ain't no way I was gonna let it slip away!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Lotta:
A bit later, I hear this loud thud. I figured, it was my last chance to snap a photo from behind the statue.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.......Well then, would you please show us the photo?
</line><line>Lotta:
Awww... Why do I have to...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-This is...!
</line><line>Ema:
The person in the red raincoat who attacked Kay!

</line><line>Lotta:
Yeah. I thought it was strange too. I coulda sworn there were two of 'em, but... ...when I looked, there was only the one. But, that's gotta be the killer, don't ya reckon?

</line><line>Lotta:
Their hand was stained bright red, so I figured it was them.
</line><line>Ema:
What happened to the auction after the murder?
</line><line>Lotta:
Nothin' really. It just went on like normal. I guess those rich folks didn't give a hoot. They got some nerve.

If we assume that the murder took place in this storeroom... ...then we must conclude that the body was here as well.
</line><line>Ema:
Huh? Isn't that... pretty obvious?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you remember how the participants left the auction?
</line><line>Ema:
Of course. They'd pass through this storeroom on the way back from the auction... Ah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly.

</line><line>Ema:
OK! Let me show you the power of science!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The glint in her eyes is getting brighter by the second...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Let's start by examining that ladder over there! Based on Ms. Hart's picture... ...the person in the red raincoat headed towards that ladder. Chances are, something will turn up if we check there! Just touch anything you want to examine! If you do that, you'll be able to spray the luminol reagent at it! If there's a bloodstain on the spot where you sprayed, you'll get a reaction like this. Even so... Ugh. No matter how many times I see bloodstains, they're always so gruesome... There's a blood reaction here, but it's kind of faint. Let's spray it with luminol two or three more times, so it'll be nice and clear! You can see it clearly now. Ugh... It looks even more gruesome than before. Do you understand how to look for bloodstains now? There are probably a few more bloodstains here, so why don't you give it a try, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line>

<line>Ema:
Let's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that! First, let's look for a place to spray the luminol reagent.
</line>



<line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! There's a bloodstain here too...!

Just what do you think you're doing here, Ex-prosecutor Miles Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I do not believe that Kay is the culprit behind this incident.

You're just an ordinary man without investigation rights. What you say does not matter... I am Franziska von Karma. I will never stop moving forward. However, you chose to quit. The outcome of our battle has already been decided.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I cast away my badge... because it became a millstone around my neck. I shall continue moving forward, even without it. The path I walk will surely lead to the truth... My actions are driven by that belief. And that is something which will never change.

The victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.
Then, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.
Shouldn't the letter make it obvious who the culprit is?
Of course, the crime scene was right here in this room: the P.I.C. meeting room.

I wonder about that. Have a look at this piece of evidence. Blood was found in the storeroom right above the meeting room. As you can see, there are signs that it has dripped down onto the floor below. And right under the hidden lift is...
</line><line>Franziska:
The statue of Lady Justice...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then you understand. The murder did not take place here. The killer murdered the victim in the storeroom, and then moved the body to this room. What Lady Justice witnessed was a coward trying to conceal their crime! And not the moment of the murder!
</line><line>Franziska:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...She's smiling?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
...Pardon me. I just remembered a conversation quite similar to this one. As I expected, Miles Edgeworth. ...Such naïveté couldn't possibly be an act.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Just how is Mr. Edgeworth naïve!? YEOOOOOOWCH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Have you forgotten? Or are you just playing the foolish fool? The amount of blood in the meeting room is clearly greater than in the storeroom.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uugh... Please don't just hit me and then ignore me... YEAAAARGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Such a large amount of blood couldn't have simply dripped from the floor above. And even if it had, there should have been much more blood left behind in the storeroom! The murder could not have occurred anywhere other than this meeting room!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmph. You're as predictable as always, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The difference in the amount of blood is just as you say. The question is, why does such a difference exist?
</line><line>Franziska:
That issue is trivial. I've already explained it with my perfect logic.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, how do you explain the blood that was found in the storeroom? I don't suppose you're going to tell me that it somehow sprayed all the way up there?
</line><line>Debeste:
Like a water fountain? No waaay!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. It's impossible. In other words... ...the reason for the difference in the amount of blood is... <textEffects>(The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss.
</line><line>Franziska:
...That's obvious just from looking at the bloodstain.
</line><line>Debeste:
But that's so weird! She was attacked in the storeroom, but there was less blood found there than... GYAAAUUGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Silence! You third-rate prosecutor!
</line><line>Debeste:
But I'm the Best... GYAAAUUGH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you know when you lose the most blood after getting stabbed with a sharp object?
</line><line>Ema:
Ah! I know! It's when the sharp object is pulled out, right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. After being stabbed with the candelabra, the body was moved to the meeting room. And then, the murder weapon was pulled out right here in this very room... That would account for the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind!
</line><line>Ema:
But why would the culprit go through all that trouble?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Most likely to give the impression that the murder occurred in the meeting room. It seems Ms. Crane's keycard was used last night... ...but based on the time of use, it must have been a ploy by the culprit to mislead us. In all likelihood, it was the culprit who used the keycard to enter the meeting room.
</line><line>Franziska:
Why would culprit have needed to do that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps they feared that the storeroom would be found out during the investigation? If they were involved in the auction, they would not have wanted it to become public.
</line><line><textEffects>Meeting Room Blood data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
The auction... you say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps you should go upstairs and see for yourself what items are on display. I'm sure that will allow you to understand what occurred here.
</line><line>Franziska:
........ ...Impressive, Miles Edgeworth. You're willing to go that far to protect her?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's something big lurking behind the scenes of this case. Kay simply got caught up in it.
</line><line>Franziska:
You're exaggerating.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Am I now? More than anyone, I would think you'd understand the significance behind all this. Why would you, a prosecutor working with Interpol, be involved in a domestic case? Wasn't your objective to crush a certain international smuggling ring? If your search for smuggled goods has led you here... ...then, isn't this feeling I have related to the case?
</line><line>Franziska:
...I'm relieved. You haven't lost your touch, even though you've turned in your badge. I've heard about your situation... from Scruffy over there.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah, umm... sorry, sir. I just wanted to help out somehow...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A wise decision, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska, are you the one in charge of this case? Isn't Interpol pursing the black market auction?
</line><line>Franziska:
And what if I am? That's not something you need to know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you knew about all this from the very beginning? You knew the black market auction was being held... right here.

You!

Hey! I ain't done talkin' yet! AIIIEEEE! Ya ain't changed a lick!

This case doesn't need even a fragment of your faulty testimony!
</line><line>Lotta:
What're ya sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa-OWWW!
</line><line>Franziska:
Back then...! You gave false testimony...!
</line><line>Ema:
...Ms. von Karma seems to really dislike Lotta.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I can't say she's fond of her.
</line><line>Lotta:
Ain't that Crane gal one of them P.I.C. members? She's the spittin' image of the Conductor! I reckon she's... YEEOOOWCH! She hit me! She hit me again!
</line><line>Franziska:
What is the meaning of this!? Answer me, Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
From Ms. Hart's testimony, we obtained a description of what the Conductor was wearing. And it matches what the victim, Jill Crane, was wearing.
</line><line>Franziska:
You mean to say... the one who was murdered was the Conductor! ........!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Ms. von Karma, maybe you should calm... AIIEEEEE!
</line><line>Franziska:
It would seem that a new fact has just been brought to light. ...Indeed, I came here in pursuit of the black market auction. In order to arrest the organizer of the event... in other words, the Conductor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we believe Ms. Hart's testimony, then the Conductor is already dead. Wouldn't this mean that your investigation has ended in vain?
</line><line>Franziska:
That's right. However... ...I swear on my name that I will not return empty-handed! I challenge you, Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A challenge is fine, but... ...why is she readying her whip like she's out for a victim of her own?)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --</textEffects></center>
<line>Franziska:
I will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?
That would mean the culprit is someone who participated in the auction.
If that photographer is correct, the victim was the Conductor, and the culprit was a customer.
The culprit waited for the victim in the storeroom, where the goods were delivered.
Then, they stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra in the storeroom.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
...That is all. I trust you have no objections.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, that is not the case, because there is a hole in your testimony.
</line><line>Ema:
As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I didn't noticed anything at all! Well then, please settle this with one blow!

Yes, of course. Watch as I crush her logic!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska, calm down and listen. Ms. Hart witnessed a part of the murder. The main point here is that after witnessing the murder, she says the auction continued...
</line><line>Lotta:
That's right! Sure as can be! They all just kept goin' on shamelessly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you think the auction could have continued without someone conducting it? If the victim was not the Conductor, the person killed must have been... a customer!
</line><line>Franziska:
Nooooooooooo!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
As I said from the beginning, Kay is not the culprit. After all, she herself was attacked by someone and lost consciousness. In which case, that would also make her a victim.
</line><line>Ray:
If the auction continued after the incident occurred...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. And the victim was not the Conductor, but a customer...

That's enough!

Well, then... Blaisie, what brings you here?
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is this kind of father-son relationship really healthy...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
I had come to light a fire under you, but it seems I've found an unexpected bonus. To think that the criminal who has become the talk of the town would be here, of all places.
</line><line>Courtney:
Everyone! Restrain the suspect at once.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please wait! Kay Faraday is not the cul-
</line><line>Blaise:
Silence!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Blaise:
This is quite troubling, Edgeworth. Didn't I tell you earlier? The P.I.C. desires a swift resolution to this case. If it's not, we could lose our trust with the public. They'd call us the Waste of Time Committee. Y'know, it's troubling for me as well, that sort of thing... And at my age too... *sniff* *sniff*
</line><line>Courtney:
And on top of that... an illegal investigation is not something that I can overlook. Have you forgotten? You are no longer a prosecutor. You have lost all your authority. Furthermore... you have aided a criminal in evading the law.
</line><line>Blaise:
Yes, yes. That's right. You're so reliable, Courtney.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am aware of the consequences of my actions. You may punish me as you wish. However... ...we have found a new suspect. It's the person pictured here. Kay Faraday was attacked by this person and...

</line><line>Courtney:
There is no need for your explanation. Just recently, a red raincoat was discovered in the vicinity of this building. The victim's blood and cherry blossom petals were found on the hood.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Cherry blossom petals? <textEffects>(Now that you mention it, on the viewing platform...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. They probably stuck on due to the blood. They were littered around the bloodstain.
</line><line>Blaise:
And we've received the forensic report on the blood, y'know. There's no doubt about it. The person in that photo is the victim, Jill Crane.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What did you saaaaaaay!?
</line><line><textEffects>Red Raincoat data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-Impossible! That would completely destroy the foundations of our logic. We had believed the person in the red raincoat was the culprit. And now it turns out... that person is actually the murder victim. W-Wait. If that's the case, then the prime suspect would be...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. Faraday. You met a person in a red raincoat on the rooftop, did you not?
</line><line>Kay:
Yes. I did, but...
</line><line>Courtney:
The person in the red raincoat was the murder victim. And Kay Faraday came into contact with that person. Since one of the parties is now dead, what happened next should be clear...

Kay was attacked by that person! As the victim, it would be impossible for her to be the culprit!

</line><line>Courtney:
There is no evidence she was attacked, is there? Furthermore, we must consider the possibility that the victim fought back.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's far too early to come to that conclusion! Kay is not the criminal!
</line><line>Kay:
......You're wrong.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
K-Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
That's... wrong. Even though I don't want to believe it myself... After hearing about the raincoat, I finally remembered. I only remember a little, but... from what I saw that night... ...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That can't be right!
</line><line>Kay:
Then, why? Why do I have that memory? That person collapsed before my eyes... engulfed in a pool of blood... Why didn't I do anything? It must have been... because I killed her...
</line><line>Courtney:
It is clear to me, the validity of Kay Faraday's memory.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Didn't you doubt it until just now, pal!?

It sides with me, y'see. But y'know, the beautiful bond between you two has been etched deeply into my heart.

</line><line>Blaise:
I beg to differ! ...That's right. Y'see... He's no longer a prosecutor, sadly enough.
</line><line>Courtney:
Your actions have gone too far this time. An illegal investigation, and assisting in the escape of a criminal... I cannot even think of you as a former prosecutor! Now, humbly accept your punishment!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Blaise:
Oh, yes, that's right. I believe the plan of today was to hold your hearing before the P.I.C. Why don't we leave the hearing for tomorrow. Even though the result is already crystal clear. You should think long and hard about what you've done. ...Very long and very hard.

<line>Edgeworth:
Let's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?
</line><line>Courtney:
I am not planning anything. There is merely a question I wish to ask.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You're asking me?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes, of course. Who else is here? Objectively speaking... you are a clever individual, and you have a sharp mind. As a prosecutor, you are highly talented and capable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you being ironic? Your sarcasm falls short.
</line><line>Courtney:
I am being completely sincere. And that is why I cannot understand. Take this case, for example. You're up against the P.I.C. There is no chance for you to come out on top. Even a child could understand. And yet, you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Perhaps my younger self would not have done something so reckless. ...The me from before had power. That's why I thought justice was on my side. Just like you right now...
</line><line>Courtney:
.....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, because of a certain man, my self-centered sense of justice was broken down. Ever since then... I began to see people in a different sight. I'm able to serve as a prosecutor only because of the support of the people around me. People like Detective Gumshoe, and all the other investigators. And... Kay, as well. Honestly, even I'm surprised at how much I have changed...
</line><line>Courtney:
I see... Is that how it is? I've come to understand you a little more.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understand me? Not likely. Someone like you, who forces her own sense of justice onto others could never understand.
</line><line>Courtney:
...I wonder about that. Is that what you think?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Courtney:
If I could say one thing... ...it would be that this conversation has been very interesting. ...That is all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..........
</line><line>Courtney:
Our conversation is coming to an end, however... I have one last thing to tell you. The date of your hearing has been set. I came here today to inform you. Today. In the P.I.C. meeting room. May you humbly accept your fate.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Another visitor...?)</textEffects> Kay!
</line><line>Kay:
Ah...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems you're alright. I'm relieved... for now.
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know, this is kinda touching... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You look a little down, Kay... Please, cheer up. You didn't do anything wrong. I guarantee it.
</line><line>Kay:
...Please, just accept it. I am a murderer.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's not true! Why won't you believe in yourself!?
</line><line>Kay:
What should I believe in? I mean... there's nothing...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's nothing to believe in? That's not true. Before you lost your memories, you literally jumped into my life. As a result, your words and actions have become engraved in my memories... That's the mark you left behind. How can you call that "nothing"? I believe in your innocence. That's why you must believe in yourself as well.
</line><line>Kay:
.....Thank you. But, it's no use. Look at all the misfortune I've brought upon you. If you can, please forget it all. Your memories of Kay Faraday...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know, this takes me back. In my youth, I too was a gallant...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is this... the kind of justice that the P.I.C. seeks?
</line><line>Blaise:
Hmm... Justice, huh? I wonder...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This man, what is he planning? Why is he pushing things forward so forcefully...? It all seems too unnatural. Is there a hidden agenda? There's no time left! It's all or nothing now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Well then, I must take my leave...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hold it!

<line>Edgeworth:
No matter how you look at it, Kay's arrest was unnatural... There must be something behind it.

Hey, hey. I'm a busy man, y'know. I'm kind of a big deal, y'see. I trust this won't take up too much of my time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(In order to make it out of this situation, I must break through his defenses!)</textEffects> There are plenty of things I want to ask, but my time is limited.  First, I'll ask about <textEffects>why he rushed the arrest</textEffects>. I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.

<line>Edgeworth:
Why did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation.
</line><line>Blaise:
Explanation? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't play dumb with me! You clearly did not follow the proper procedures!
</line><line>Blaise:
OK, OK. Maybe you should pipe down a bit. Do you even know the position you're in?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Blaise:
Suppose we let the criminal escape. What do you think will happen?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What will happen?
</line><line>Blaise:
I would be made to take responsibility, y'see. I do hope you understand.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Blaise:
Just take my advice and stay out of this, if you know what's good for you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....I refuse. Kay is innocent!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know... This is so pitiful... It brings me to tears. Why won't you just give up...? Things were finally going well.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Things were going well, you say? That's a strange way to put it. It almost sounds as if you personally wanted Kay to be arrested... ...far more than necessary. Haven't you lost your impartiality?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Blaise:
Hmm, you think so? That certainly wasn't my intention, y'see... Edgeworth, my boy, you're reading too much into it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He skillfully avoided the issue... However, I still have some serious doubts about Kay's arrest. Next, I shall ask him <textEffects>if the investigation was sufficient</textEffects>. I can't miss even the tiniest piece of information. That's the only way to break through this situation!

Young folks always live life in the fast lane... That's why I like to bully 'em. You'll regret this, soon enough.

Heh. Ridiculous... I was just thinking about my next strategy... ...on how to extract information from a weepy old man.
</line><line>Blaise:
You should show some remorse, y'know. Don't you get it? I hold your fate in my hands.

<line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Blaise:
In any case... even if you obtained some information... ...there's nothing you can do. Just give up already.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I refuse.
</line><line>Blaise:
...Mind if I ask why?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's simple. The truth is fading away... That's all there is to it!
</line><line>Blaise:
I see. I'm starting to understand what kind of person you are. But y'know, it's all useless. It's enough to make me cry. G-Give it up. That girl's guilt has already been d-decided.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
That's strange... The way you said that, it almost sounds like it was decided from the very beginning.
</line><line>Blaise:
.....What are you trying to say?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Yes... it's clearly unnatural. Everything is progressing as if Kay's guilt was predetermined. Wasn't Kay's arrest... planned from the start?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Blaise:
.....I see. That's an interesting theory. But I don't have time to indulge in your flights in fancy, y'know. Why don't we put an end... to this silly conversation?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
C-Curses! He's trying to get away! Before that, I must find out <textEffects>if the arrest was lawful</textEffects>! It's still very faint, but... I'm beginning to see the path to the truth. I can't let this opportunity slip by!

Aren't you just pretending to be busy?

You don't want to talk about the case... Isn't that... why you're trying to get away from this place?
</line><line>Blaise:
How sad. Yes. How sad indeed... Do you really suspect little old me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I do suspect you. And I'm confident about it. There was clearly no basis for Kay's arrest.
</line><line>Blaise:
My, my. Have you forgotten? Wasn't there evidence? The mask, the letter, and the corsage... All were found in the girl's possession. Not to mention, she even confessed. All of this serves to prove her crime.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's...
</line><line>Blaise:
...Any objections?

What is most crucial here is... ...how much this man knows about this case. If I can get him to reveal that...! It's do or die! If I can overcome this, I'll reach the truth!

Can't you give it a rest already? At my age... my body's not as strong as it once was, y'know... Th-There is no one else who could be the c-culprit, besides her. She was even given that much evidence to show that she committed the crime...

<line>Edgeworth:
She was given evidence, you say? That's an odd choice of words. It almost sounds... as if she did not possess them under her own will.

<line>Edgeworth:
You arrested Kay, even when you knew of the existence of the true culprit...? Don't toy with me! There is no way such an act would be tolerated!

If I had to say, maybe the P.I.C. And also, maybe me, y'know? Ah ha ha ha ha! When I heard your words just now, I could barely hold back my tears, y'know. It was just so splendid, y'see. And it burns me up inside! I'm not the most perfect piece of work, y'know. So I can't forgive such youthfulness. You say the truth is important. But y'know... Once you know the real value of the truth holds, I wonder if you can still say the same thing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Blaise:
When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.

Ngh...!

...Good, very good. That face. That expression! You were such a desperate one, y'see. That's why I really wanted to bully you, y'know? Y'see, even if you know the truth, there is simply nothing you can do. And that's the real value of truth. So shocking that it's to die for, y'know?

Why don't you pursue the true culprit!? How much of the truth do you know!?

<line>Blaise:
Ten members are present. The quorum has been met... From here on out, let the council begin! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A clear conscience... Don't make me laugh.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Courtney, please give us your report.
</line><line>Courtney:
On April 5th, Prosecutor Edgeworth carried out an illegal investigation and resisted arrest. He was arrested by two of our members who caught him in the act: myself and Blaise Debeste. Prosecutor Edgeworth disrupted the investigation of Attorney Jill Crane's murder. He claims that the culprit, Kay Faraday, was arrested without sufficient evidence. Even now, his claim remains unchanged.
</line><line>Blaise:
Tell us more... about the murder incident.
</line><line>Courtney:
On April 5th, the victim's body was found here, in the P.I.C. meeting room. Regarding the details...
</line><line>Debeste:
I, Sebastian Debeste, the best prosecutor, will enlighten you!
</line><line>Courtney:
The prosecutor in charge, Sebastian Debeste, will explain the rest of the details.
</line><line>Debeste:
The murder happened on the night of April 4th. The victim was one Jill Crane. On the same night, a black market auction was being held in this very meeting room. I guess Ms. Crane was taking part in the auction. Yup.
</line><line>Courtney:
The murder occurred in the middle of the auction, did it not?
</line><line>Debeste:
When Ms. Crane was found, she was dressed like the Conductor of the auction. However, based on the fact that the auction continued after the murder occurred... ...I deduced that Ms. Crane could not have been the Conductor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(You weren't the one who made that deduction...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian, please show everyone the basis for the arrest of the culprit.
</line><line>Debeste:
You got it, Justine. Kay Faraday was unable to bear the weight of her good conscience......
</line><line>Courtney:
I believe you mean her "guilty" conscience.
</line><line>Debeste:
Yes. It was her guilty conscience that drove her to confess the crime. According to her confession, on the roof of this building... ...she met a figure in a red raincoat on the viewing platform.
</line><line>Blaise:
So Crane was wearing a red raincoat?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes, that's correct. The culprit used the Conductor's clothes as a red herring to mislead us... At the time of the murder, Ms. Crane was wearing a red raincoat.
</line><line>Debeste:
It was I who discovered the raincoat near this building!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He did? I'm sure it was the forensics team who found it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
To be more precise, it was the forensics team under Sebastian's orders who discovered it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I thought as much!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
According to the blood analysis... ...the person in the red raincoat and Ms. Crane were the same person! The decisive evidence is the culprit's own confession. She testified that she killed her! That's right, the culprit is Kay Faraday! It couldn't have been anyone else but her!
</line><line>Blaise:
Well then, Edgeworth. If you have any objections, let's hear them.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....I have no objections.

I see, I see. It seems all the fight's gone out of you after your little overnight stay...

</line><line>Debeste:

Edgeworth, my boy. Despite how things may seem, I actually kinda like you. If...! And this is just an "if", y'see. If you were to withdraw your objection... ...you might be sitting on this side of the bench tomorrow.

I'll ask you one more time, Edgeworth. Do you have any objections?

I'd advise you to watch what you say!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This man is the one who should watch what he's saying! I'm talking about the case! Not about a chair! I demand a testimony! By all means, let me hear that! I want to know how the P.I.C. understands this case!
</line><line>Blaise:
A testimony from us, eh? Fine then. If that's what it takes to make you happy. Courtney, give him the materials from the investigation.
</line><line>Courtney:
Sir? But, that's...

<center><textEffects>-- Summary of the Case --</textEffects></center>
<line>Courtney:
Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.
The red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...
We believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.
The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.
Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.
That was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The red raincoat was up for auction...? Is that a fact?
</line><line>Courtney:
It is quite likely. The red raincoat had been a piece of evidence... ...in the assassination attempt on the President of Zheng Fa, as you well know. Originally, it should have been stored in an appropriate place... But when I asked about it... I learned that it went missing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And it somehow made its way to the black market auction... Certainly, a natural conclusion.
</line><line>Blaise:
My, my. Well done, Courtney. Your explanation is as clear as ever.
</line><line>Courtney:
...I am much obliged. Prosecutor Edgeworth, will you concede defeat now?

She is an eyewitness to this case. Isn't it only natural for her to be in attendance?
</line><line>Lotta:

</line><line>Courtney:
Perhaps I simply do not wish to be as tactless as you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears you have failed to get the witness to tell you the most vital information. Please look at this photo. This was taken by Ms. Hart.
</line><line>Courtney:
This photo seems to have been taken in the storeroom. And, what of it?

According to your reasoning, the incident took place on the viewing platform. However, Ms. hart encountered the incident in the storeroom! That's right, it had taken place just before this photo was taken!

W-Wait...! If that's true, then Justine's reasoning...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly, it does not hold up.
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart, allow me to ask you again. You saw the person in the photo with your own eyes, correct?
</line><line>Lotta:
I sure did. I seen 'em plain as day with my own two eyes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what did you think at the time?
</line><line>Lotta:
I figured I was about to get me a big scoop! ...Ya know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Debeste:
I guess that makes sense.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ahem. That's not what I meant. What did you think of that person?
</line><line>Lotta:
Huh? Well... I reckoned she'd help me bring home the bacon.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Are you mocking me?
</line><line>Lotta:
Aww shucks, don't make that scary ole' face. It was just a harmless little joke. The person in the red raincoat? I reckoned they were the culprit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I hope you understand now. The crime occurred in the...

</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, I cannot understand your argument if you do not say it out loud. If you had simply asked, I would have been more than willing to explain.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Explain what?
</line><line>Courtney:
The sounds Ms. Hart heard may not necessarily be related to the case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is impossible! Enough of your excuses!
</line><line>Courtney:
Was the voice that Ms. Hart heard really that of Ms. Crane?
</line><line>Lotta:
Such a shady conversation must've had somethin' to do with the case!
</line><line>Courtney:
What did her voice sound like?
</line><line>Lotta:
H-Her voice? Well... it beats me. How was I suppos'd to know!? They were both usin' voice changers.
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. The voices Ms. Hart heard had been altered by a device. We must therefore question whether or not they have any bearing on this case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
......Hmph.
</line><line>Courtney:
You need not object just because you wish to sigh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, it seems I have greatly overestimated you.
</line><line>Blaise:
No, no. Courtney is quite amazing, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You claim that the sounds Ms. Hart heard no bearing on this case? Even if they do not, it doesn't change the fact that the crime took place in the storeroom. At the very least, the crime must have occurred before the victim went up to the rooftop. The reason being... <textEffects>This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
At first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit.
</line><line>Kay:
Well... Ms. Hart's testimony certainly made it sound that way...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. It was because she saw that the person's hand... was covered in blood. Anyone who heard her testimony would have arrived at the same conclusion. The person in the red raincoat was the culprit... and the blood on their hand was the victim's. However, if the person in the red raincoat was the victim, then the situation changes completely. Since blood can be seen in this photo, it must have been taken after the crime occurred. It seems we've been under the wrong impression in regards to <textEffects>the victim's condition</textEffects>. This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom. Immediately afterward, the victim was seen with blood on her hand. That must mean... ...the victim was still alive even after she was attacked. The blood on her hand must have come from her own wound.
</line><line>Debeste:
No way! Are you saying that she died from a hand injury?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, that is not the case. I suspect she just held her hand against the wound. It can't be seen in the photo, but at this moment, she must have already suffered a fatal wound.
</line><line>Blaise:
Hoh, hoh. If that's true, then it changes a lot of things, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems you understand. This refutes the allegations against Kay. Kay encountered the victim after this picture was taken... I believe at that point in time, the victim was already on the verge of death. It's likely Kay just happened to be present when the victim reached the end of her strength.
</line><line>Courtney:
...That is quite the coincidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. I can only say that she was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, it seems you have forgotten a crucial fact.
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah, you mean that, right? He must be pretending that he hasn't noticed it, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did you say...? Are you implying that I forgot something?
</line><line>Blaise:
Courtney. I think it's about time you gave him his last rites.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey, pops! Justine's with me, you know! Don't order her around like that!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know... even though you're my son, you're so embarrassing.
</line><line>Debeste:
I'm not embarrassing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I'm sorry, but you're both rather embarrassing.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Justine! Give Mr. Edgeworth his... umm...
</line><line>Courtney:
Very well. I shall give him his last rites.

When the body was found, there were three wounds in Ms. Crane's chest.
I'm sure you're well aware what kind of wounds these were, right?
Yes, she was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra.
Is there any person who could survive such an injury?
Please take a close look at the autopsy report. Can you still say the same thing after reading it?

Well done, Justine! With this, Mr. Edgeworth will...

I will offer a rebuttal, of course.

Why would you do that!? Didn't you hear what Justine just said?

Of course, I did. And I still plan to object to it.

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Chairman Debeste, do you know what this is?
</line><line>Blaise:
It seems to be a red raincoat. How about it, Courtney?
</line><line>Courtney:
The victim... Ms. Crane was wearing this earlier. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Must I repeat my explanation to you all over again?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose it just might come to that. Judge Courtney, answer me this. This red raincoat was stained with blood... Do you happen to remember where specifically those bloodstains were located?
</line><line>Courtney:
Of course I do. They were on the hood... W-Wait, it can't be!
</line><line>Blaise:
Hm? What does this mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, were there any other bloodstains besides the ones on the hood?
</line><line>Courtney:
None... were detected.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't you think it's strange? The victim died from a stab wound to the chest. In that case, there should have been bloodstains on the front of the raincoat. However... the only blood they found was on the hood! This is a huge contradiction! The wound on the victim's head is no ordinary wound. After all, the victim sustained this wound before she was stabbed in the chest.
</line><line>Courtney:
...It does appear that way, doesn't it? The victim first suffered the head wound. If she had already been stabbed in the chest, the raincoat would have been stained with blood... Therefore, it is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she stuffed the head wound. So the order of the wounds would be: first the head, followed by the chest. However, does that really change the situation?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
With this, a contradiction is born. One that overturns all of our assumptions up until now...
</line><line>Courtney:
Is the change really that great? I look forward to hearing it. Well then, this contradiction, why don't you show it to me? With evidence!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Which piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young. According to this... ...the head wound was postmortem.
</line><line>Courtney:
But that's not what the raincoat shows...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly, it's the exact opposite.
</line><line>Courtney:
Bailiff! Hurry and summon Dr. Bonnie Young at once!  Until we hear what she has to say, we cannot close the curtains on this case!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Officer:
Yes, ma'am! Understood!
</line><line>Courtney:
Dr. Young is a busy person. It will take some time for her to arrive. In the meantime... let us try viewing this case from another angle. There's something that's been on my mind. One of the key figures in this case... The "Conductor". We still don't know who that person is.
</line><line>Debeste:
Now that you mention it! Even after our investigation, we still have no idea who it is.
</line><line>Courtney:
The Conductor has come up time and time again during this hearing. However, at this point in time, their identity remains a mystery. How about it? Do you have any ideas?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm still not sure at the moment. However... ...there is someone I have in mind. A certain individual involved with this case, who might know something about it.
</line><line>Debeste:
Who's that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! I demand your testimony!
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!
</line><line>Blaise:
........
</line><line>Debeste:
Don't say such a stupid thing! Why would you suspect pops!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Are you trying to cast suspicion towards the Chairman of the P.I.C.? Do you understand... what that means?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Status and prestige mean nothing before the truth. That man is trying to pin the crime on Kay! The evidence that was in Kay's possession: the ticket stub, the mask, the corsage... These items did not come into her possession out of her own volition. By some method, that man purposely planted them on her personage.
</line><line>Courtney:
........ It is hard to believe such a sudden accusation... but I'll ask just in case. Why... would he do that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Obviously, to direct suspicion towards Kay. I succeeded in drawing out those words from him earlier.
</line><line>Courtney:
Mr. Chairman, your response?
</line><line>Blaise:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you too shocked to speak?
</line><line>Blaise:
.....And what of it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Blaise:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said, "What of it?" You say that you drew out some words from me, but you don't have a shred of proof, y'know? No one else heard it but you. It just doesn't work like that, y'see. Or do you have something else? Y'know, some kind of basis for your argument?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This confidence... He also showed it at the cell...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I would like you to explain once more. I trust we have your permission, Mr. Chairman.
</line><line>Blaise:
But of course. I'm pretty interested in this matter myself, y'know. I'd like to know just what part of me semes criminal to Edgeworth. There's no one as honest as I am, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How can he say that with a straight face...?)</textEffects> Let's start from the top... The fact that the auction was held in this room is a cause for suspicion. This is the P.I.C. meeting room. I imagine it would be difficult for non-members to enter.
</line><line>Debeste:
That's why... all the members have keycards, you know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think we can assume that multiple auctions have been held here before. Therefore, suspecting a member of the P.I.C. would be...
</line><line>Debeste:
...Debeste!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-Yes. Because the Conductor had to have been a P.I.C. member.
</line><line>Debeste:
Wait! Nooooooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha... <textEffects>(What was that all about!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-What do I do, pops? I just helped the enemy!
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha. Sebastian really is an idiot, y'know. But y'see, Edgeworth, I'm not the only one with access, y'know?
</line><line>Courtney:
Indeed... There are eleven members in the P.I.C. Even if we rule out the victim, Ms. Crane... there are still ten potential suspects.
</line><line>It's not me!
</line><line>B-B-B-But, it couldn't be the Ch-Ch-Ch-Chairman, right?
</line><line>I don't know who it is, but whoever it is should just come forward!
</line><line>Blaise:
Yes, yes. Everyone, just calm down, y'know? Edgeworth, is that all you got? Where's the evidence to suspect me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Blaise:
Oh? So you've fallen silent. But you've gone too far, y'see. I won't forgive you anymore. It's too late for regrets, y'know? I'm a very important man, y'see. Former Chief Prosecutor and Chairman of the P.I.C.!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

It just doesn't matter, y'know. 'Cause y'see, none of that means anything, y'know.
Think about it. We've got the suspect herself saying she killed the victim.
That's all that matters, y'see. She'll even get a lighter sentence with her confession, y'know.

That person... He's very important, isn't he? Mr. Edgeworth... It's alright. Let's just give up... Surely, I must have killed her... I can even remember it...

Even if you say that, y'know, it still won't solve anything. What good will it do to deny her confession? Sounds like nonsense to me. Wanna try asking her again? I think she'll just say that she's the murderer again, though.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Very well. Let's try asking her again, one last time. I'd like to hear from Kay herself. Whether or not she is the culprit.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh...? From... me?

Will that be alright? If this goes poorly, it will be quite unfavorable for you...

Y-Yes!

I know what I'm asking of you is unreasonable, but please, I want you to answer me. It doesn't matter how tiny it is. Do you... Do you remember anything? Anything that would prove your innocence...!
</line><line>Kay:
...Why? Why would you go that far, for me...? I... I can't do it. .....I'm sorry. .....I'm too scared to remember. Because... I might have done something even worse. If that were the case... ...I would only make things worse for you, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay Faraday must have been a despicable criminal... Someone who betrayed your trust...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Don't worry. We've only known each other for a short while... but I know you very well. I'd even say that I know you better than yourself, now that you've lost your memories. <textEffects>You cannot possibly be the culprit. Because, your true identity is...!</textEffects>

There's no clear evidence to prove that you're the culprit, besides your own confession. Remember what I said? You must believe in yourself. Or perhaps... you cannot trust my words?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see now..... I thought it was strange. The reason you were acting like you wanted to be found guilty... ...was because you were concerned about me... That is just like you, Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
It's because... you're a good person, Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... I may fall short of your expectations. I am not trying to be a good person. No matter how much you may want me to give up... I'll keep trying to save you. That is the nature of who I am. Whether or not it is a burden for you is none of my concern.

</line><line>Blaise:
Nevertheless, y'know. Her vague memories cannot be trusted, y'know?
</line><line>Courtney:
Her memories are vague? That would be bad for us as well. Didn't you say this earlier yourself, Mr. Chairman? Since we have the suspect's confession, we don't need to worry about the trivial details. If we decide to doubt her memories... ...then we must also doubt her confession, which is the main foundation of our case. Are you willing to do that, sir?
</line><line>Blaise:
.....Aah. You're right. Well, never mind then. I shall leave it to you.
</line><line>Courtney:
Thank you very much.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(W-We did it. It was touch and go for a while there, though... ...however, those words of Judge Courtney just now... It almost feels as if... she is on our side...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, do you know anything about this stuffed animal?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The stuffed animal Kay spoke of must have been this. We found it in the storeroom. It is believed to be one of the items for the auction.
</line><line>Courtney:
This is...!
</line><line>Debeste:
Hm? Do you know something about it, Justine?
</line><line>Courtney:
N-No... It's just a bit different from what I imagined.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Indeed... it's certainly not what I would have expected the victim to be carrying. Let's examine every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off.
</line><line>Kay:
This horn... It looks like you can move it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...!
</line><line>...*bzz*...*bzzz*...
</line><line>Kay:

</line><line>Courtney:
We cannot verify when these voices were recorded. It's also possible that they aren't related to the case at all. If only we had some video as well...
</line><line>Lotta:
That's hogwash! I'm tellin' ya, that right there was the conversation that I heard! The victim was holdin' on to it, right? I reckon it must've been recorded when she got attacked!
</line><line>Courtney:
That certainly is a possibility... However, your testimony alone is insufficient. I require something with a little more credibility.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Again. Her words... It almost sounds as if she's trying to give me advice...)</textEffects> Judge Courtney. There's no mistake that those voices were from the incident. Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal. "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." If we compare this part of the recording with a certain piece of evidence... we can prove it. <textEffects>(This evidence shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
The autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I remember clearly what that voice said... "You can't hide that <textEffects>burn</textEffects> from me." On the victim's hand, there was a <textEffects>burn mark</textEffects>.
</line><line>Blaise:
Indeed... it just happened to match up, y'see. But, what of it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
According to Kay's testimony, the victim had been holding the stuffed animal. And, it just happened to record a <textEffects>characteristic</textEffects> of the victim. Namely, the <textEffects>burn</textEffects>.
</line><line>Debeste:
That's just a coincidence! I mean... it could happen, right?
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
I do not think so. It is hard to believe that all of this is simply a coincidence. The voices on the stuffed animal were most likely recorded during the incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
One of these voices must belong to the true culprit. From what we've heard, it must have been the one who was doing most of the talking.
</line><line>Debeste:
But what's the point? In the end, we still can't tell their gender or identity, you know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, because they had been using voice changers. It can't be helped.
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems the situation has become quite clear. The conversation Ms. Hart overheard was between the culprit and Ms. Crane.
</line><line>Lotta:
...That's what I've been tellin' you from the start.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And from this, we will understand a new fact.
</line><line>Courtney:
Please enlighten us then. I trust you have no objections, Mr. Chairman.
</line><line>Blaise:
...Do what you want.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
According to Ms. Hart's testimony, just before the incident... ...two people came up from the auction hall, using the lift. It must have been the Conductor and one of the auction guests. They probably went there to settle the payment after winning a bid. And then, it was there that the crime was carried out... Since the auction continued after the crime took place... ...we are led to a single truth! <textEffects>(This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Since the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going... ...we can conclude that the deceased victim could not have been the Conductor.
</line><line>Debeste:
...Umm, Justine...
</line><line>Courtney:
Please be quiet here. Okay?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If the Conductor was not the victim, then they must have been the culprit!
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
Please wait. That alone is insufficient.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course. Even I do not intend to rely only upon the process of elimination.
</line><line>Blaise:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Certain traces left at the crime scene led me to believe that the culprit is the Conductor.
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then, please show it to us.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>What were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room. In doing so, we were led to believe the meeting room had been the scene of the crime. It was a ruse by true culprit. To hide the blood that had fallen from the storeroom!
</line><line>Courtney:
So we wouldn't find out about the existence of the black market auction... Correct?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. If the culprit had been unrelated to the auction, there would have been no need to do such a thing. Ergo, the culprit could have only been the Conductor!
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then... Do you have any idea as to who the Conductor might possibly be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The auction hall is at the <textEffects>P.I.C. meeting room</textEffects>, and furthermore, there is a <textEffects>storeroom</textEffects> above it. The Conductor must have been, at the very least, a member of the P.I.C.!
</line><line>Blaise:
So..... ...in other words, you suspect me, I take it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isn't it natural to suspect you, the one with the most authority in the P.I.C.?

<line>Edgeworth:
Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
</line><line>Blaise:
Edgeworth. And what about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste, don't you understand? The meaning of this piece of evidence.
</line><line>Blaise:
Weeell. Y'know, I can't say I do. I mean, it doesn't look like it's related at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gwaaah! <textEffects>(So this wasn't it...! Blaise Debeste has to be the culprit. However, do I have any evidence to prove it?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(.....Somehow I feel uneasy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
Y'all sayin' the culprit was the Conductor, right? That means, the <textEffects>victim was a customer</textEffects>. Now, here's where it gets a mite strange. Ya see, there were <textEffects>11 people</textEffects> at the auction. When the auction continued after the incident... ...I went straight on over and snuck a peek down below.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-You don't mean.....
</line><line>Lotta:
That's exactly what I mean. All <textEffects>11 people</textEffects> were still there, present 'n acocunted for.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-aaaaaaaaaaaat!
</line><line>Courtney:
Are you sure about that?
</line><line>Lotta:
Sure I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.
</line><line>Debeste:
Umm... so it <textEffects>started with 11 people</textEffects>. And there were still <textEffects>11 people after the murder</textEffects>... Was it a ghost!?
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know, Sebastian. Normally, a prosecutor would call that a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>, y'know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-Were there really no changes in the auction at all?
</line><line>Lotta:
Really! I'm tellin' ya! The auction just went on like normal. Ah. But... there was one itty bitty thing, though.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What was it?
</line><line>Lotta:
Ya know those <textEffects>hammers</textEffects> ya always see at an auction? Like the one that lady is usin' over there.
</line><line>Courtney:
...An <textEffects>auction gavel</textEffects>... perhaps?
</line><line>Lotta:
Yup, that's the one! All of a sudden, I couldn't hear the sound no more. It'd been bangin' away just prior to it.

Please wait, Mr. Chairman. I believe it is still too early to make a judgment. There are still... a few mysteries left in this case. Until we have solved them all, we cannot call this a complete victory.

Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was expecting you to shout... ..."Hold it!" ...like you always do.

</line><line>Blaise:
Well then, what is it? What sort of mysteries are left?

Huh...? What's strange?
</line><line>Courtney:
This court has found an error in Dr. Young's autopsy report. Dr. Young, please tell the truth. Did you falsify the autopsy report?

That's terrible! How can you accuse her of that...!? "I have no idea what you are talking about. Why would I do such a thing in the first place?"
</line><line>Courtney:
To protect the true culprit... Of course.
</line><line>Karin:
"Watchu talkin' bout!? I would never do such a thing!"

How strange. In that case, why would there be an error in the autopsy report, I wonder. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you think?

</line><line>Courtney:
Oh? I expected you to press into her statement like you normally do.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why is she taking control of the situation and trying to help me...? I don't know what her goal is... but I must play along.)</textEffects> If the autopsy report you gave to Sebastian had been authentic... ...then the error should not have been there.
</line><line>Debeste:
W-Wait a minute! I didn't do anything!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is what we will figure out from this point on. Firstly... Dr. Young. I'd like to hear your testimony.
</line><line>Karin:
Why do you want to hear her testimony? It would be pointless!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I will be the one who decides whether or not it is pointless. Not you.
</line><line>Karin:
There are patients waiting for us! ...B-But Granny... Ouch! Anyways, we don't have time for this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is there any way I could convince you? This is of the utmost importance.

</line><line>Karin:
......Oooh! I, I...!
</line><line>Courtney:
With that, we've proven that the wound on her head came first, followed by her chest wound. Ms. Jenson, why did you falsify the autopsy report!?

</line><line>Blaise:
Hold on a second. She never said she falsified it, y'know? She just made a teeny tiny mistake when she wrote it down. "Postmortem" and "antemortem" sound kinda similar, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They are complete opposites! That is the very definition of falsification!
</line><line>Kay:
Ms. Jenson, why would you lie...?
</line><line>Karin:
Kay... Ouch! "I want you to tell me too. Why you would do something like that...?" Granny...! But, I.....!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because you falsified the autopsy report, Kay fell under suspicion. Tell me why you did it!
</line><line>Karin:
I, I... can't say! I just can't say it...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Not "I don't want to say", but "I can't say"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
You're all a bunch of bullies, y'know. Ganging up on this poor girl who loves her grandmother so... She is totally unrelated to this. I think we can forgive her for one tiny mistake.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That won't do. Aren't you the one with the most to lose if she testifies?
</line><line>Blaise:
Hmm? What are you saying? Y'see, as a "former" prosecutor, you'll have to speak a little more clearly, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. As you wish, I shall answer clearly. Ms. Jenson played an essential role in this case!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson falsified the autopsy report in order to assist the true culprit.
</line><line>Karin:
Ah... Owwwwwchhh!
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha! That girl is an accomplice? What's your basis for that claim?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It was impossible for a single person to commit this crime in the first place. The crime could not have been committed without at least two people. Namely because...!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
...if the Conductor was the culprit, and one of the auction guests was the victim... ...it would contradict the witness's testimony that there were eleven people after the incident.
</line><line>Lotta:
What now? Ya got a problem with my testimony!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Not at all. Rather, it is because I believe your testimony, that's why an accomplice must exist.
</line><line>Blaise:
So, you still won't admit that your reasoning is wrong?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Up until now, we had not even considered the possibility of an accomplice. However, if there had been an accomplice, it changes the entire story completely. If the accomplice took the murdered auction guest's place... ...then the number of people remains eleven!
</line><line>Blaise:
Oooh... I see now. So that's what you're thinking. But, y'know, wouldn't that have been quickly discovered?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ms. Jenson and the victim have similar physiques. If she wore the victim's mask, she could have easily taken her place. Ms. Jenson, did you switch places with the victim?
</line><line>Karin:
I, I...! ...I wouldn't...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who was the Conductor...? In other words, tell me who was the true culprit!
</line><line>Karin:
I-I can't! I mean... That would also cause trouble for Granny...! Ah... Ouch! But, Granny...! "I will accept whatever wrongs you may have done. Just tell me everything." G... Gr...... Gr... Gra-Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I thought... it appears you really were the accomplice.
</line><line>Kay:
Ms. Jenson... Why...?
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. Jenson. ...Would you please tell us?
</line><line>Karin:
Yes... It's OK, Granny. I'm fine now. I... switched places with the victim, Ms. Crane.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So you admit to being the Conductor's accomplice?
</line><line>Karin:
Yes... I helped out the Conductor. I don't really know why, but for some reason... ...the Conductor was expecting to be attacked by Ms. Crane.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The Conductor expected an attack from the victim...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
They were so sure it was going to happen, that they came up with a plan to counter it. A way to beat the victim at her own game. And that's when I was called in. I was told to wait in the storeroom before the auction begin.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lotta:
Whoa there! You ain't foolin' my eyes! If you were waitin' in the storeroom, I reckon I would've bumped into you! After all, I'd been up in that storeroom the entire auction!
</line><line>Karin:
I'm telling the truth!
</line><line>Blaise:
I wonder about that, y'know. Can we really believe a girl who would falsify a report?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... There should've been many places to hide in that storeroom.
</line><line>Blaise:
Then by all means, tell me. Where did our little nurse hide!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
She hid inside this costume drunk.
</line><line>Blaise:
A costume trunk... eh?
</line><line>Lotta:
Ah! Now that ya mention it, that box was already there before I snuck in! I figure I would hide in there myself, but it was wrapped up nice 'n' tight with a chain. And it was locked too, so I had to give it up.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suspect that when you sneaked into the room, Ms. Jenson was already inside the trunk.
</line><line>Karin:
Yes... it would've been bad if one of the guests from the auction had opened the bid. After instructing me to hide inside... ...the Conductor wrapped a chain around the costume trunk. I think they went downstairs using the lift shortly thereafter. It was right before the auction...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So then, when the auction began... ...only you and Ms. Hart were in the storeroom.
</line><line>Karin:
Yes, that should be right...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The auction had been going on as usual, but... ...when a certain participant made the winning bid, the Conductor committed the crime. Ms. Hart must have heard the altercation that occurred then.
</line><line>Lotta:
You betcha! I was tremblin' behind that there statue the whole time though!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Following the altercation, Jill Crane was murdered. After killing Jill Crane, the Conductor carried her body to the costume trunk... ...and Ms. Jenson, who had been hiding in the trunk, was made to take Ms. Crane's place. The victim's body was placed inside the costume trunk. The Conductor then took Ms. Jenson, who had been made to look like Jill Crane... ...and returned to the auction hall as if nothing had happened. Was this roughly what happened in the storeroom during the incident?
</line><line>Karin:
Yes... That's right.
</line><line>Lotta:
Pullin' the old switcheroo with one of the auction guests... Ain't that impossible? That gal and the murder victim are two completely different people, ya know. Don't ya reckon one of the other participants would've noticed and caused a ruckus?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, not at all. The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique. Furthermore, there was a rule requiring a mask to be worn during the auction. If their clothes were the same, I doubt anyone would've noticed she was a different person.
</line><line>Karin:
...Yes. I blended right in. I borrowed Ms. Crane's clothes and... Ouch! "You mustn't embarrass the dead like that!" I know... I also thought it was pretty heartless to leave her exposed like that... So when the Conductor wasn't looking, I covered her up in the raincoat that was up for auction.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So she was the one who put the red raincoat on the victim...)</textEffects> And then, the auction resumed as if nothing had happened.
</line><line>Lotta:
I reckon I took the picture of her in the red raincoat after that. That'd make all the facts line up.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lotta:
After I took the photo, I went over to the lift to sneak a peek down below. I witnessed the 11 participants, and then I high-tailed it back behind the statue.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... You were hiding there the entire time until we found you?
</line><line>Lotta:
Nah, that's... How should I put it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...? What is it? Did something happen?
</line><line>Lotta:
I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
S-So something did happen!
</line><line>Lotta:
I-It ain't no big deal! Kinda embarrassin' to say, though. There was this huge *THUMP* sound all of a sudden... I was a liiiittle surprised by that. It was right after I had just witnessed a murder, so I was shakin' in my foots... My hear sorta tightened up, and I was off to la-la land... When I woke up, it was already the next day, 'round the time y'all came by the storeroom.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. So there was a large sound... Ms. Hart, I take it you do not know what transpired in the storeroom beyond this point?
</line><line>Lotta:
I-I guess. But after the auction, all the masks were properly returned... So I reckon the participants had exited through the storeroom, just like I done said!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... Ms. Jenson, what were your actions after the auction resumed?
</line><line>Karin:
I took the victim's place and participated in the auction. The Conductor instructed me to win the the bid for the costume trunk... ...because the body was inside it. It would have been bad if another auction guest won the bid for it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You didn't realize the box was empty?
</line><line>Karin:
No. We only found out when I came up to the storeroom to pay the bill. The Conductor was with me and told me to go search for her immediately. And then... I found another girl collapsed in front of the ladder!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay...
</line><line>Karin:
Yes. She probably fell down from the rood and lost consciousness.
</line><line>Lotta:
Maybe the victim left the hatch open when she went up to the rooftop.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I understand now. Kay was surprised at seeing the collapsed victim and did not notice the open hatch. She must have missed her footing and fell down into the storeroom. Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.
</line><line>Lotta:
That mighta been it. Though I reckon it'd be kinda pathetic to faint over something like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When Ms. Jenson found the unconscious Kay... ...Ms. Hart was also unconscious behind the statue. The situation is becoming clearer to me. Ms. Jenson, please continue your story.
</line><line>Karin:
After I found Kay and the victim, I... put them both in the trunk. If the customers at the auction found out, there would've been a huge commotion.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was this an order from the Conductor as well?
</line><line>Karin:
Yes, it was... But, since I secretly decided to put the raincoat on Ms. Crane... ...I had to dispose of the raincoat without the Conductor noticing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... So the Conductor didn't anticipate the raincoat becoming another piece of evidence.
</line><line>Karin:
And, finally... ...we dressed Ms. Crane in a spare Conductor's outfit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. In doing so, you made the victim appear as if she was the Conductor.
</line><line>Karin:
In the end, the auction ended without anyone noticing anything.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... Ms. Jenson. Your crimes have become clear. If you know anything else, please hold nothing back.
</line><line>Karin:
I want to help you more... but that is all I know... Umm, if I had to say, there is just one thing that bothers me. When I took Ms. Crane's place, I borrowed her clothes... ...but there was no way for me to borrow her hair... Ouch! "What kinda coroner's assistant goes around stealin' a corpse's hair?"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I would think that robbing the deceased of their clothes would be questionable enough...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Both the color and the length of our hair is different, so I was worried about how to disguise it. However, the Conductor even had a wig prepared for me. In fact... he had two of them. Inside the costume trunk, there was both a straight wig and a wavy wig.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Two wigs...? Why were there two?
</line><line>Karin:
Who knows...? Maybe it was a precaution, in case the victim had changed her hairstyle...? I ended up using the straight wig to match Ms. Crane's hair.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So that means the wavy wig was left unused...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Karin's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is that really all you know?
</line><line>Karin:
Yes... Yup, that's really all I know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So that means you don't know who the Conductor is?
</line><line>Karin:
...I'm sorry. I only knew that person as the auction conductor... I never saw that person without a mask on. The Conductor seemed to be on guard... towards everybody.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Nngh! <textEffects>(At this rate...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth, is that all you've got? Even if that little nurse is an accomplice, it changes absolutely nothing, y'know? In the end, the true culprit is still Kay Faraday. All you did was add another criminal, y'know. The rule of law cannot be overturned. At least, not for your sake.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is this as far as I go? Am I unable... to save Kay...?)</textEffects>

Didn't I tell you, Miles Edgeworth? Wherever there is a case, I will follow.
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor von Karma... Your hard work is most appreciated.
</line><line>Franziska:
However... Don't get the wrong idea. I only came here to find out the truth behind what happened to Kay Faraday. ...I don't plan on forgiving you for abandoning the prosecutor's path!

Yes. Well, just a few minutes ag- AARRGH!

You should've told me sooner!

<textEffects>(You're the one who barged in here and started talking!)</textEffects>

Well, then... does that mean you've found out what the murder weapon was already?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, not yet.
</line><line>Franziska:
Hmph... Is that so? In that case, listen well. The victim was struck on the head with a blunt cylindrical object. The wound on her chest was suffered postmortem.

</line><line>Franziska:
Interpol is after the black market auctions. And I'm the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The victim particpated in the auction. Therefore, it is only natural for me to investigate. Especially now that she's been murdered.
</line><line>Blaise:
.....I see, I see. Clever girl, little Von Karma.

<line>Franziska:
Unfortunately... the murder weapon has yet to be found.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Just knowing the shape of the murder weapon, gives me an idea as you what it might be.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey, hey! In my investigation, we didn't find any other murder weapons, you know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you consider the Conductor's possessions and the crime scene, the answer should be clear. The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction... Namely, an auction gavel.
</line><line>Debeste:
An auction gavel? We didn't find anything like that!
</line><line>Courtney:
If the culprit is the Conductor, it is possible that the gavel may be murder weapon. However... that alone is not reason enough, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course, I have proof to back it up! <textEffects>This piece of evidence proves that the murder weapon is the auction gavel...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
According to Ms. Hart's testimony, after the victim had been murdered... ...it seems she suddenly stopped hearing the sound of the gavel during the auction. However, she had been able to hear it up until then. Why was that... you ask? It was because it had been used as the murder weapon and was covered in the victim's blood... ...it became necessary to dispose of it. Isn't that right? Blaise Debeste!
</line><line>Blaise:
.........
</line><line>Franziska:
...I'll have a search for the murder weapon performed immediately.
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha! Well... Good luck with that, y'know. You've gotta work as hard as you can while you're young, y'see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Kh...!

...That is most unfortunate. It seems... I am left with no choice, but to pronounce a verdict.

Well... it sure seems that way, y'know. Normally, you wouldn't commit a blunder like leaving behind the murder weapon, y'know. The best criminals would never do something like that, y'see.

Documents... you say? Why would you suddenly...? Wait... you don't mean...! On the day of the crime, the record of your keycard being used was because...!
</line><line>Courtney:
I came to this room to fetch these documents, of course. Although... when I entered the meeting room... ...it seems it was before the black market auction had begun. At first I told you that I came to gather documents about you, Prosecutor Edgeworth... At that time, I simply could not tell you the truth.
</line><line><textEffects>IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
What are you doing, Justine!? Why are you indicting Pops!? Without any basis... th-this is slander!
</line><line>Courtney:
That was a wonderful remark, Sebastian!
</line><line>Debeste:
...Huh? R-Really?
</line><line>Courtney:
Of course there is a basis. During the case 18 years ago... ...Prosecutor Manfred von Karma "<textEffects>fabricated</textEffects>" information regarding the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That was because the body of the sculptor, Isaac Dover, had been stolen...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Papa "<textEffects>fabricated</textEffects>" information about a body? What do you mean...!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Detective Lacer, who handled the initial investigation, reported that the body had gone missing. However, in order to deceive Prosecutor von Karma... ...there is a person who purposely did not report to him that the body had disappeared!
</line><line>Franziska:
What...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did you say...!?
</line><line>Courtney:
That person would not forgive those who defied him, nor would he allow others to hold power. He would use any means necessary, in order to bend others to his will. And then... also 18 years ago... ...Director Young, was ordered by a certain individual to write a <textEffects>fake autopsy report</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Dr. Young was the one who wrote the autopsy report for the IS-7 Incident!?

P-Please wait! Granny didn't do anything wrong! She was ordered by that person... She had no choice but to obey!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That person...?
</line><line>Courtney:
<textEffects>That person</textEffects>... was the <textEffects>Chief Prosecutor</textEffects> at the time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Chief Prosecutor... 18 years ago... Y-You don't mean...!
</line><line>Franziska:
The Chief Prosecutor... who gave Papa his first penalty...
</line><line>Courtney:
It was none other than you! Blaise Debeste!

</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian. We do not need your opinion right now. ...Blaise Debeste. Do you have a rebuttal?
</line><line>Blaise:
Fabricating stuff about the body, Von Karma did all that on his own, y'know. Falsifying the autopsy report? Young. You would actually do something like that? Maaan... Y-You really did some terrible things behind my back, y'know...?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Seeing as how all the parties concerned are here today, we should ask them directly.

</line><line>Karin:
P-Please wait! Granny is... Ouch! Granny... I'm sorry! I... knew. That's why I...! Yup... Because if I didn't... He said he would expose you! If I didn't assist in the crime, Granny would be prosecuted! That's what that man... the Conductor... told me!
</line><line>Blaise:
...............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So Ms. Jenson... was being threatened. Was the Conductor who threatened you... Blaise Debeste?
</line><line>Karin:
Th-That... I don't know. The person who threatened me was the auction conductor. They do have similar physiques, but I never saw the person's face...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Any trivial thing is fine! Give us a characteristic that could be a clue...!
</line><line>Karin:
......Th-That's right! The Conductor's mask, it <textEffects>exposed just a tiny part of his face</textEffects>. There was a <textEffects>tattoo</textEffects> there. I'm sure of it!
</line><line><textEffects>Conductor's Clothes data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A tattoo... you say?
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Blaise:
I really have no idea what you're talking about, y'know. As you can see, there are clearly no tattoos on my face, y'see. So that person doesn't match me at all, y'know. The person who threatened her, this so-called Conductor... I wonder who it is, y'know. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Courtney:
You have incurred the wrath of the Goddess of Law. I suggest you watch what you say.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hasn't he incurred your own wrath, rather than the wrath of the Goddess...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Jill Crane had been pursuing you, just as I have. ...And I will not let her death be in vain.
</line><line>Blaise:
Crane was... y'know. You say she was pursuing me? My, my. I didn't really know her that well, y'know. I don't mind girls chasing after me, y'know. But I don't recall her ever falling for me, y'see.
</line><line>Courtney:
...You didn't know the victim well? That is a testimony we haven't heard up until now. Before the eyes of the Goddess of Law, you shall give us an official testimony!
</line><line>Blaise:
...I see, I see. Everyone is bullying me. I-If you're gonna go that far... That's fine, y'see... I'll just have to make you disappear.......... Every last one of you.
</line><line>Courtney:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall cooperate with you as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Courtney:
If we let this opportunity slip by, I doubt we will ever get him to stand in court again. Please. do not let this chance go to waste...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes..... I promise I will live up to your expectations.
</line><line>Courtney:
Now then, Blaise Debeste, you shall testify regarding the victim!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Regarding Jill Crane --</textEffects></center>
<line>Blaise:
The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.
Personally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.
Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.
I have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...You intend to deny your guilt until the bitter end, don't you?
</line><line>Debeste:
Of course he does! There's no way Pops could be the criminal! I mean, he's my pops, you know! He's the very best, like no one ever was!
</line><line>Blaise:
Yes, yes, Sebastian. If you're gonna stick up for me, be sure to have a clear basis, y'know.
</line><line>Debeste:
A-Alright... I got it! I'll clear you of these false accusations, Pops. I believe in you, Pops! We won't lose to someone like Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Blaise:
Yes, yes. ...You really are pure, y'know?
</line><line>Kay:
That person... he really loves his father, doesn't he...?
</line><line>Franziska:
However... one must be able to accept the mistakes of their father... ...no matter how much they may look up to him...
</line><line>Courtney:
...Each person must atone for their crimes, no matter who they are.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..... <textEffects>(This is going to be hard for Sebastian, but... ...I simply cannot overlook his father's crimes!)</textEffects>
</line>

<center><textEffects>-- Regarding Jill Crane --</textEffects></center>
<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>Personally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Blaise:
<textEffects>I have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I will have to organize my information about the victim...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
...If there's anything you don't understand, you should look over the evidence again. Perhaps you'll find a new fact this time around.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! Franziska... You're willing to help me?
</line><line>Franziska:
I told you, I'm doing this for Kay Faraday... not you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Franziska seems to be worrying about Kay in her own way.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... If that is true, then it creates a huge contradiction.
</line><line>Blaise:
Oh? A huge contradiction, y'say...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would like you to listen to the voices recorded on this stuffed animal one more time.
</line><line>...*bzz*...*bzzz*... *bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...
</line><line><textEffects>I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>........</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Silence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!</textEffects>
</line><line>AAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We were under the impression that this was the moment when the victim was murdered. <textEffects>"I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me."</textEffects> ...We thought that this statement was said by the culprit.
</line><line>Blaise:
I-Isn't that fine? What's the problem, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... There is a huge problem with that. If the victim had been wearing gloves from the start... ...it would have been impossible to see the burn on her hand!
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Blaise:
Gloves come off very easily, y'know? She could have taken them off during the auction.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! That's...!

</line><line>Karin:
That's not true! Ms. Crane had been wearing her gloves when I took her place! She must have been wearing them before she was murdered!
</line><line>Blaise:
Wh... What are you saying? You! Don't you understand the position you're in!?
</line><line>Karin:
I-I... I'm not scared anymore! I have Granny here with me! "Blaise... Your day of reckoning has finally come."
</line><line>Blaise:
...Somehow... it seems like you all want to disappear... permanently!

</line><line>Debeste:
Hey! How dare you say that to Pops! Does it really matter if the burn mark was visible or not?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It certainly does matter. If the burn mark was visible, then we'd have a complete turnabout of the situation!
</line><line>Debeste:
Wha... What are you saying!? If the victim's burn mark wasn't visible, what exactly does that tell you?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Sebastian. ...Turn your way of thinking around. If the victim was wearing gloves, then her burn mark could not have been seen. In that case, <textEffects>whose burn mark was seen</textEffects>?
</line><line>Debeste:
Someone else's... burn mark...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. The culprit must have had a burn mark as well. In other words... <textEffects>"I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me."</textEffects> The person who said this... was not the culprit, but the victim!
</line><line>Debeste:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Blaise:
...Sebastian. Could you please step aside? Edgeworth. All your reasoning up til now was just a figment of your imagination, y'know? The culprit had a burn mark? ...Where was it, y'know? If you can't answer that, then your logic doesn't hold up, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Where was the culprit's burn mark...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
...I wonder where the burn mark could have been...? During the auction... wasn't everyone wearing a disguise?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Indeed. During the auction, everyone should have been dressed in a particular way. <textEffects>(If the burn mark was still visible under those conditions, then...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Now, now. Why don't you show us? <textEffects>Where was the culprit's burn? ...You'll have to show me the proof, y'see!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It was what the Conductor was wearing the auction... In other words, the outfit you were wearing at the time!
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! What can you figure out from the clothes alone?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Conductor had been wearing a white suit, white gloves, and a mask... His attire had covered up most of his skin. However, according to Ms. Jenson's testimony... ...the Conductor's mask exposed a small part of his face. In addition, while she thought there had been a tattoo there... ...it's possible that she simply mistook the burn mark for a tattoo!
</line><line>Debeste:
! A burn mark... on his face...?
</line><line>Blaise:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blaise:
That's all very scintillating, but I'm afraid you're getting excited over nothing, y'know. None of the P.I.C. members have any burn marks on their faces, y'see. Naturally, that includes me as well, y'know!
</line><line>Debeste:
Huh...? P-Pops...? But.....!
</line><line>Blaise:
...Sebastian. Could you please be quiet? If you're an idiot, then act like one, y'know?
</line><line>Debeste:
......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Normally, Sebastian is a nuisance to everyone around him... ...but this time, I owe him my gratitude. That reaction from Blaise's own son... It reveals the truth more clearly than anything else. Thanks to him, I am confident that my reasoning is correct! I know who that unidentified piece of evidence belongs to!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
I wonder what's wrong with that prosecutor...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Usually, Sebastian is slower to arrive at the truth than anyone else. However, this time he has probably figured it out. His own father... is a criminal.
</line><line>Kay:
Since he knows the truth... He's... in pain, isn't he? ...If he didn't know the truth, he could have remained blissful in his ignorance...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Kay. We are here in order to pursue the truth. It doesn't matter what path my reasoning takes, the important thing is to arrive at the truth. Once before... when I lost faith in my reasoning, you said that to me and showed me the way. This time, I shall show you the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>. You are innocent!
</line><line>Kay:
...I..... ...I also... want to know the truth. Mr. Edgeworth... Please tell me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... That's the spirit.
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's impossible, y'know. For all of you. I mean, just where could I possibly have a burn mark? It's nowhere to be found, y'see! There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know.
</line><line>Debeste:
Th-That's right! There's no contradiction at all! There's no way there can be a contradiction! Not for my Pops...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Sebastian. I understand why you don't want to admit it. However... if you avert your eyes from the truth, you will regret it forever.
</line><line>Debeste:
! P-Pops... I... Just what should I do...!?
</line><line>Blaise:
......Hah. I really wonder... Why you're such an idiot, y'know? Sebastian. If you really wanna save me, you'll have to try a little bit harder, y'see... Gotta use your head, y'know? ...Honestly, you really are a useless idiot.
</line><line>Debeste:
N-No way...! But, I tried real hard... I tried my best, Pops! I went to the school you told me to go, reached the top of my class, just like you told me to! Just look at this jacket! Only someone who graduates at the top of his class gets to wear it! I did everything you told me to do! That's how I got to be the best at the academy! I even won all those awards, just so I could be like you, Pops...!

</line><line>Blaise:
You really are... such an idiot, y'know.
</line><line>Debeste:
...!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y'know those gold stars you got on your tests, I made the teachers give them to you. Every speech and debate contest, all of the judges were my friends. Y'know, Sebastian. If you weren't even able to notice something like that... ...you're really not worthy of being called my son. Don't you think?
</line><line>Debeste:
Ah... ah... ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAaaaaaaaahhh!
</line><line>Blaise:
Awww... Even my son has disappeared... Ah ha ha ha ha ha... Oh my... It's enough to make me cry, y'know. H-He was trying his best for me, and yet, he was totally useless, y'know...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You are truly a despicable person. As the Chairman of the P.I.C., and as a father...!
</line><line>Franziska:
...Even I feel sorry for that foolish prosecutor.
</line><line>Kay:
...Poor Mr. Prosecutor...
</line><line>Courtney:
Blaise Debeste! You... Just what do you think of your own son!?
</line><line>Blaise:
He's just a useless pawn, y'see. Whoa now. Maybe you should look in the mirror before you criticize me, y'know. I mean, even you... you also used Sebastian to get close to me, didn't you?
</line><line>Courtney:
...I cannot deny that. However... he is not a mere "pawn"! He always tried to do his very best, even if the results aren't up to par. I've seen just how hard he tries. ...And yet, you refuse to even acknowledge it...!
</line><line>Blaise:

</line><line>Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha! That kid is no good, y'see. No matter what he does... or is told to do!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning. <textEffects>(If there was a burn mark on the Conductor's face... ...then Blaise Debeste must be hiding it. What was he wearing during the auction? That is... key to revealing the truth!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then, allow me to hear your answer! <textEffects>Please show the piece of evidence that proves the culprit had a burn mark on his face!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
If you would recall Ms. Jenson's testimony. There's still one point that remains unexplained. Two types of <textEffects>wigs</textEffects> had been prepared, one of which was left unused.
</line><line>Courtney:
Do you mean the wavy wig...?
</line><line>Franziska:
...What are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It was something Ms. Jenson found when she switched places with the victim.
</line><line>Franziska:
What does something like that have to do with the burn!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Inside the costume trunk, Ms. Jenson witnessed <textEffects>two wigs</textEffects>. One of them had been used by Ms. Jenson to make her look like the victim. Now then, just what was the other wig used for?
</line><line>Franziska:
...It doesn't seems like it was a spare wig.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no need to overthink it. Just compare the attire of the true culprit, the Conductor, with that of Blaise Debeste.
</line><line>Blaise:
......! D-Don't stare at me like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't you think there's just one spot where there is a huge contradiction? Specifically, around his face.
</line><line>Franziska:
! So that's...!
</line><line>Kay:
...Not a wig at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. ...It was no wig. Blaise Debeste! It was your fake beard!
</line><line>Blaise:
A... Ah ha ha... This is... a real beard, y'know. Don't tease me like that, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Your son must have realized the truth before anyone else. That's why he was trying so desperately to protect you. You were also worried that he would tell the truth... Isn't that why you drove your son away from here? Because... he knew that his father was hiding a burn under his fake beard!
</line><line>Blaise:
G... Grr...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! How about you remove that fake beard of yours!
</line><line>Blaise:
Y... YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHITBURNSITBURNSTHEGOGGLESDONOTHING!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... A burn mark...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Justice has been served before the Goddess of Law... For that, I give you my thanks.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I should be the one thanking you.
</line><line>Courtney:
Blaise Debeste! I hereby announce my verdict! You shall be taken into custody for the murder of Jill Crane!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 6, 9:44 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room</textEffects></center>
<line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... Thank you very much. I am so happy that you believed in me to the very end!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...There's no need to thank me. As a prosecutor... No, as a friend, I simply wanted to save you.
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I bring good tidings. It seems that former Chairman Debeste has been safely detained in the detention center. However, the search for the murder weapon, the auction gavel, continues... Blaise Debeste is a shrewd man. There is a good chance that he has already disposed of it. There is also... one piece of testimony that concerns me. Blaise Debeste mentioned that the only thing he did not fake were the letters.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Courtney:
First, he found this letter in Jill Crane's clothes... Then, he also found this letter on Kay, who was unconscious in the storeroom. The contests of the letters seem to suggest that the two had been corresponding with each other... Which is why Blaise Debeste assumed that the two were working together.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ridiculous. That can't be right.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
After reading the two letters, he decided to pin the crime on Kay Faraday. In order to cast suspicion on her, he planted one of the letters in a noticeable spot... ...the deceased Jill Crane's left breast pocket.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isn't that just an excuse?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. That is what I thought as well. It may have simply been a last-ditch effort to save himself. However, before the stern eyes of the Goddess of Law, these are all trivial matters. His crime shall certainly not go unpunished. With this, I have finally fulfilled one of my long-standing missions.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. Will you tell me what you know? Why did Blaise Debeste murder Jill Crane? And what lies hidden behind this case?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. I don't mind. You have the right to know everything. Long ago, Jill Crane was in love with a cameraman. That man was pursuing the black market auction as a journalist. And then... before he could reach the truth, he was erased.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise. ...Although in the end, she was the one who was murdered instead...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... So that's what happened.
</line><line>Courtney:
While the Goddess of Law cannot condone her actions... ...we have succeeded in her goal of bringing Blaise Debeste's crimes to light.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So, Judge Courtney's goal was to expose Blaise Debeste... ...and reveal the <span style="color:#E16935">dark secrets</textEffects> of the P.I.C.)</span>
</line><line>Kay:
Umm... By the way, what happened to the young prosecutor...?
</line><line>Courtney:
...We have been unable to contact him for some time now.
</line><line>Kay:
Do you have any idea where he might be...?
</line><line>Courtney:
I... had not been truly working for him, so...
</line><line>Kay:
I see... I feel very sorry for him.
</line><line>Franziska:
...What you should be sorry for, is the fact that he was kept in the dark until now. No matter how cruel reality is, he will have to accept it. If he can't... he won't be able to walk his own path in life. ...Ever.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...A father's influence is not something that is easily erased. However, I'm sure he will be able to change from here on out.
</line><line>Kay:
Yes... That's right. Surely... You must be right. Will I too... be able to walk my own path in life...?
</line><line>Karin:
Kay! Is your body alright!?
</line><line>Kay:
Y-Yes. Thanks to you...
</line><line>Karin:
I'm so sorry! Even though you're my patient... ...you ended up getting suspected because of me... Ouch! "You can't just take care of the patient's body. You gotta take care of the heart too." That's my Granny! Kay, how are your memories?
</line><line>Kay:
I feel like... I'm on the verge of remembering something...
</line><line>Courtney:
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That would be the trial for the murder of Horace Knightley... Who's in charge of the defense?
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. Crane was supposed to be her defense attorney, but now that she has passed away... ...we are currently arranging for a replacement defense attorney.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Jill Crane had been in charge of Patricia Roland's defense!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
I'll also have to get in contact with Sebastian quickly, since he's the prosecutor in charge... Well then...
</line><line>Kay:
Ah...! P-Please wait! What about Mr. Edgeworth's prosecutor's badge? What will happen... to his prosecutor's badge?
</line><line>Courtney:
With the chairman's arrest, the P.I.C. is no longer functional... ...so I cannot answer that question easily. Perhaps one should say... Only the Goddess of Law knows?
</line><line>Kay:
B-But that's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You don't need to worry about me. This is the path that I have chosen.
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems you have no plans to change it either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course not. I chose this path to seek the truth.
</line><line>Courtney:
...With the departure of Blaise Debeste, the Law has once again returned to our hands. If you truly desire to continue the prosecutor's path... ...I am willing to assist you in reclaiming your badge.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I appreciate the sentiment... but I must decline. I did not relinquish my badge with half-hearted feelings.
</line><line>Courtney:
I see... It seems that our paths of Law will continues to run counter to each other.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Heh. Until our paths cross once again, I shall have you hold onto that badge.
</line><line>Courtney:
That was my intention from the start.
</line><line>Franziska:
.....
</line><line>Courtney:
...However, on occasion, the Goddess of Law is quite generous. Please return this notebook to its proper owner.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay's "Promise Notebook"!
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems this was scheduled to be put up for bidding at the black market auction. The name "Kay" is written on the notebook. It seems Blaise Debeste quickly realized this belonged to the girl. Since the letters he found also contained the same name...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You speak as if he really did not know about the letters. Are you saying that Blaise really did not prepare the letters himself?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. That man said so himself... Kay Faraday's goal was to steal back the notebook. Jill Crane's goal was to get revenge. In order to achieve their goals, the two teamed up to infiltrate the auction... or so he says. 
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... this was all Blaise's misunderstanding. It was purely a coincidence. If the attorney from the P.I.C. and Kay really were acquaintances... ...it would be strange that she never mentioned it to me, considering her personality.
</line><line>Courtney:
Ha ha. You really do trust her, don't you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.......
</line><line>Courtney:
In the end, the notebook was used as another red herring, but... It's something that is very important to that girl, isn't it? I'll make a special exception and return it. I'm sure that's what the Goddess of Law desires.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's... Um.... I appreciate it.
</line><line>Courtney:
I shall pray that she recovers her lost memories.
</line><line>Kay:
Umm... Is something wrong...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Kay. I am returning something very important to you.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... This is...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Always greet people with a smile, even people you don't know. Never cry in front of strangers. Look, Daddy! I wrote them all down! Yup! I'll be sure to follow all of our promises, and become a hero just like you, Daddy! ...Ah! That's right! There was one more... I forgot to write down the most important promise! Promise number five... Always try your hardest to learn about things you don't understand! Eheheh... I'll be sure to remember. I'll never, ever forget them!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
...Always try your hardest... to learn about things you don't understand... That's right... I'm... "I" am...! I am...! ...the "Great Thief" who steals the truth, Kay Faraday! I'm the Second Yatagarasu, and Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay... You remember!?
</line><line>Kay:
Eheheh... It's kinda embarrassing, though. Thank you so much! It's all thanks to you, Mr. Edgeworth! Even when I lost my memories, you were still always trying to save me, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... It seems you're back to normal.
</line><line>Karin:
Wow! Kay! You've gotten better! Your health comes first! Now you can relax! "Just make sure you don't run off and lose all your memories again."
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... Ms. Jenson, Dr. Young! Thanks for worrying about me.
</line><line>Karin:
"Hey. If you're feeling all better, how about changing back into your own clothes?" I washed your clothes for you, Kay, so they're nice and clean!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
These clothes... Wasn't Detective Gumshoe holding on to them?
</line><line>Karin:
He said forensics was done with them, so he gave them back to me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Have they revealed the results of the analysis yet?
</line><line>Karin:
Hmm... To be honest, I actually didn't think to ask about that... Now, now! More importantly, let's hurry up and get you changed, Kay!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. Still... Isn't it better if we do not remove her bandages?
</line><line>Karin:
Ah. She should be fine now. Kay just bumped her head. She didn't really have any other major injuries.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then... Why was she so heavily bandaged?
</line><line>Karin:
Better safe than sorry! A pound of prevention is worth an ounce of cure! That's my motto!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What a troublesome motto...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Come on, Kay! Let's get you dressed up over there!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Now, this is definitely what a Great Thief should look like!
</line><line>Franziska:
...A smile certainly suits you best. In the past... and now as well.
</line><line>Kay:
Ms. von Karma... Thank you for coming too!
</line><line>Franziska:
I-I... I only came because Scruffy asked me to. That Scruffy, he also wanted to see your energetic self again.
</line><line>Kay:
Gummy...! What happened to Gummy!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Who knows... Maybe he was disgusted with the man who willingly threw away his prosecutor's badge?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! <textEffects>(Detective Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
...I must be going soon. I'll be taking these ladies in for questioning.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... What's going to happen to the two of them?
</line><line>Franziska:
One aided in the murder of an attorney, the other forged an autopsy report 18 years ago... Those crimes definitely won't disappear. Of course... I will mention in court that they were being blackmailed by Blaise.
</line><line>Karin:
We'll be just fine! As long as Granny's by my side, we're invincible!
</line><line>Franziska:
...Well then, take care.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then... Kay. Sorry to ask so soon right after you regained your memories, but I have some questions.
</line><line>Kay:
Sure! Ask me anything you want!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What were you doing on the day you lost your memories?
</line><line>Kay:
On that day... I was asked to come to Gourd Lake. I don't know who called me there, though. As I was watching the moon at Gourd Lake... ...a person in a red raincoat approached me! All of a sudden, he used some kind of drug to knock me out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...! <textEffects>(What is she saying? The place where Kay saw the moon was at Gourd Lake?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
When I woke up, it seems I somehow ended up on the roof of the Grand Tower. My mind was still in a daze, so I stumbled around for a bit... That's when I found the person in the red raincoat, collapsed! I was startled. And when I stepped back in panic... ...I fell from a high place and got knocked out cold again! And, when I woke up, all my memories were gone. The person in the red raincoat... Who exactly was that person? Oh yeah... I was certain that I saw them walking in mid-air... Hmm... Somehow, this is all starting to make my head hurt!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Please calm down. You're just a little confused because you've only recently gotten your memory back. Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
This is probably the main cause of your confused memories... You saw the moon at both the Gourd Lake Park and the Grand Tower rooftop... ..which led you to confuse the two places.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? But... aren't they totally different places? Even if I was in a daze, do you really think I'd get them confused?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Most likely, there was something at the Grand Tower which led to your confusion.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The Grand Tower rooftop and Gourd Lake have two points in common. They both have a cherry tree and a food stall.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Now that you mention it...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your memories were confused because you had been in two similar locations. The person that you first saw could not have been walking in mid-air. They were simply walking on the ground at Gourd Lake Park. You must have gotten that scene confused with the Grand Tower rooftop.
</line><line>Kay:
S-So that's what happened... How dare they steal the memories of a Great Thief! They'll pay for this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nevertheless... I wonder who the person that assaulted Kay was? The person in the red raincoat, who appeared at Gourd Lake...)</textEffects>
</line><line>...*beep beep beep*...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm. What's that noise?
</line><line>Kay:
It sounds like it's coming from the storeroom! Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!
</line><line>Lotta:
Wh-What's this!? My shutterbug sense is tinglin'! I smell me another scoop!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(! Y-You're still here...!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 6, 9:53 AMGrand Tower51st Floor Storeroom</textEffects></center>
<line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! This walkie-talkie thing here is what's beeping!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm...! <textEffects>(This transceiver... Why do I feel like I've seen it somewhere before...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>...*beep beep beep*...</center>
<line>Kay:
I-It's still beeping, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'm not particularly familiar with this sort of evidence...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
C'mon, we have to answer it! Here goes!
</line>
<center>...*click*...</center>
<line>Kay:
Hello! Edgeworth speaking!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
K-Kay. Please don't just answer it on your own.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I am speaking with Mr. Miles Edgeworth, I presume?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Th-This voice is...!)</textEffects> ...Shelly de Killer!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Are you aware of the mastermind who is pulling the strings behind this incident?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You...! Why do you know about the incident!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...That's not important right now, wouldn't you agree? Right now, we're discussing the mastermind behind this case.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I've had an inkling that such a person existed, even before you said anything. After all, there was evidence to suggest that someone had used Kay to disrupt the investigation.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? There was...? So... who's this mastermind?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter. Would you kindly show me the evidence that indicates the existence of a mastermind?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It was the letter that Kay allegedly sent to the victim.
</line><line>Kay:
C-Come to think of it...! I don't remember writing that letter at all!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...Who could have prepared this letter...? I, too, am quite curious to know.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you're not the one who wrote the letter?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>What could I possibly gain from doing such an act? ...Is it not necessary for you to stand in court in order to make the truth clear? What can you possibly do, now that your badge has been taken from you...? I look forward to finding out from the shadows.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This man... How does he know that!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Do we have an understanding? Please ensure you do not betray my trust. Now then, if you'll excuse me.</textEffects>
</line>
<center>...*click*...</center>
<line>Kay:
He said the case wasn't solved yet. What did he mean by that? And why would Mr. de Killer even bother telling us that? Ugh... Nothing makes sense anymore!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This case... has not reached its true conclusion yet. However... although I've lost my prosecutor's badge, who I am still has not changed. While I don't know where this may lead me, I shall reveal the truth... I swear it!)</textEffects>
