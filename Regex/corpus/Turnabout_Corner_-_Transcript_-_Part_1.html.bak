Apollo:
<textEffects>(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary <span style="color:#E16935">Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices</textEffects>. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)</span>
</line><line>???:
Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>???:
Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome!
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh... Ah... <textEffects>(What's with this girl!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Well now, shall we begin?
</line><line>Apollo:
Begin... what?
</line><line>???:
Right, first things first... Any special talents?
</line><line>Apollo:
Erm, talents?
</line><line>???:
Yes, well, you must have at least one!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well... Uh... I guess... Defending?
</line><line>???:
"Defending"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course.
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-You think so...?
</line><line>???:
Let's give it a go, shall we?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>???:
Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just "defend" here!
</line><line>???:
First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Thanks.
</line><line>???:
We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.
</line><line>???:
What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do?
</line><line>Apollo:
What? Um, defend... No?
</line><line>???:
... Excuse me, but do you know where you are?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh!? The Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, right?
</line><line>???:
...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first.
</line><line>Apollo:
Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...
</line><line>???:
Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!
</line><line>???:
Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again?
</line><line>Apollo:
What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say "Wright Talent Agency"...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've "always come to the Wright place!" I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.
</line><line>Apollo:

Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?

Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!

Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen!

N-Noodle...?

You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?

That's the saddest thing I've heard all day.
</line><line>Guy:
You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck!
</line><line>Apollo:
Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request?
</line><line>Guy:
My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense!
</line><line>Apollo:
Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective...
</line><line>Guy:
This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make!
</line><line>Apollo:
Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves.

Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo.

Huh? <textEffects>(I have a bad feeling about this.)</textEffects>

Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel!

I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen.

Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!?

Ah, er, right. Panties.
</line><line>Guy:
That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll.
</line><line>Trucy:
I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. "Give those back!" I shouted. "Wait!"
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, that was certainly brave of you.
</line><line>Trucy:
...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...
</line><line>Guy:
A darn cryin' shame, yup.
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!
</line><line>Guy:
I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Er, right.

And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear?

Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!

I... I guess.

Let's see where we stand!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Not in a courtroom, that's where.)</textEffects> Well, the first item on our list...
</line><line>Trucy:
Phoenix Wright... Daddy's <textEffects>hit and run</textEffects> accident. We have to find the one who hit him!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Who's going to pay us for this again?
</line><line>Trucy:
And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his <textEffects>stolen stand</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...
</line><line>Trucy:
And the last request is mine! To find my <textEffects>stolen panties</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.

Let's go, Polly! To the streets!
</line><line>Apollo:
Aren't you enthusiastic.
</line><line>Trucy:
How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A <span style="color:#E16935">hit and run</textEffects>... a <textEffects>stolen stand</textEffects>... And last but not least... <textEffects>stolen panties</textEffects>.)</span>

</line><line>Trucy:

</line><line>Apollo:
What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, OK. <textEffects>(I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?

You want something?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...
</line><line>???:
Whoooh. "Money" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh.
</line><line>???:
You, kid with the hair. You want something?
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!

Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!

B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! <textEffects>(They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)</textEffects>

Excuse me, coming through.

Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin!
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(Who's this guy...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr.... Gavin?
</line><line>???:
Ah, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help?
</line><line>Trucy:
... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!
</line><line>???:
You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oooh! R-Really!?
</line><line>???:
...By your leave, Officer.
</line><line>Officer:
Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir!

Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein...

Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.
</line><line>Trucy:
Wow. It sure got me.
</line><line>???:
Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...
</line><line>???:
Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off limits.
</line><line>Apollo:
Excuse me? We have a letter of request!

...Hmm. One moment.

<line>???:
.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Thanks. <textEffects>(It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?)</textEffects> So... what's up with the mannequin there?
</line><line>???:
It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(The body... was <span style="color:#E16935">pulling the stand</textEffects>!?)</span>
</line><line>Ema:
So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.
</line><line>Trucy:
She doesn't seem that happy about it.
</line><line>Apollo:
...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.
</line><line>Ema:
I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.

Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.

What's this? So there is a problem?
</line><line>Apollo:
No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A defense request! That is a problem.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.

"White powder"...? <textEffects>(I hope it's not what I think it is.)</textEffects>

<line>Ema:
Right! Let's get detecting!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. Just touch the screen, like this. See? The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off!
</line><line>Trucy:
B-Blow?
</line><line>Ema:
It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...
</line><line>Trucy:
Wow! Amazing! It's like magic!
</line><line>Ema:
Heh heh. Isn't it though?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Right, let's give it a shot!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder.
</line><line>Ema:
Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to.
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print.
</line><line>Ema:
OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already.
</line>


<line>Apollo:
So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.
</line><line>Ema:
Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life.

My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice?

You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life.
