<title>The Return of the Great Departed Soul - Transcript - Part 1 | Ace Attorney Wiki | Fandom</title>

<line>
<i>Anime cutscene</i>
The grand, end-of-the-century Great Exhibition of London - surely, there is not a soul who has failed to hear of it. Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light.

<center>We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment!
<line>
</line>
Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you!</center>

</line><line>Iris:
...Runo! Runo, are you listening?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris?
</line><line>Iris:
Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again?
</line><line>Iris:
Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. .........
</line><line>Iris:
You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
</line><line>Iris:
Oh gosh! You're even more down!
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together.
</line><line>Sholmes:
What?! Why didn't you mention it before?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Thanks.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Thanks again.)</textEffects> ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now.
</line><line>Iris:
Six months?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned.
</line><line>Iris:
Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ah...back to moping...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me.
</line><line>Iris:
I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Why not?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley.
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.)</textEffects>

Well, I must be leaving now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The thought hadn't crossed my mind! <textEffects>(But now I'm wondering where you're going...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
Alright then, Runo! Let's get going!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing?
</line><line>Iris:
I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court...
</line><line>Iris:
Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you?
</line><line>Iris:
Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition!

Ryunosuke:
It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. <textEffects>(It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. <textEffects>(The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well?
</line><line>Stronghart:
Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space.
</line><line>Stronghart:
...Good to know.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.)</textEffects> Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status.
</line><line>Stronghart:
As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...I've not heard about that.
</line><line>Stronghart:
Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stronghart:
So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! <textEffects>(I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something.
</line><line>Stronghart:
That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...)</textEffects> Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now?
</line><line>Stronghart:
I would assume he's at his office.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...)</textEffects>

Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands.

Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

What are you doing here?

Agh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...)</textEffects> Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...I am.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No punishment is taking place here.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I didn't know you had an apprentice. <textEffects>(It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms...

</line><line>Van Zieks:
Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! What's that?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
That Nipponese man. Is he faring well?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean?
</line><line>Iris:
...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. <textEffects>(I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? <textEffects>(Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.)</textEffects>

What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne!
</line><line>Harebrayne:
...! Who are you?

I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
A LAWYER!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh! <textEffects>(Was it something I said?!)</textEffects>

A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't-
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah...

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please!
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you for that, Professor.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court!
</line><line>Iris:
Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Iris:
Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it?

Yes, I suppose that's true. <textEffects>(Time to investigate at last!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Iris:
There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. <textEffects>(We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.)</textEffects>

Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there?
</line><line>Gregson:
......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Does that make her three times a lady?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue.
</line><line>Gregson:
Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. <textEffects>(But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
Watch it, sunshine!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
S-Sorry...
</line><line>Gregson:
What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm acting for the defence.
</line><line>Iris:
So we're here to investigate!
</line><line>Gregson:
Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Is it really that troubling?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is!
</line><line>???:
Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court.
</line><line>Gina:
Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground.
</line><line>Gina:
That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's <textEffects>Inspector Lestrade</textEffects> now!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In... Inspector?! <textEffects>(That badge is homemade, surely...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us.
</line><line>Iris:
What's that supposed to mean?
</line><line>Gregson:
Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright?
</line><line>Gina:
Right...sir.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This... This raises a LOT of questions!)</textEffects>

You don't know it?! It's the most popular <textEffects>attraction</textEffects> in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like?

No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow!

Yes!

Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share.

You've seen things like this before, you mean?
</line><line>Iris:
Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!'
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs.
</line><line>Iris:
One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

Yes, 'beamed' not '<textEffects>blasted</textEffects>'. That's the point.

Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here.
</line><line>Iris:
So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it.
</line><line>Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's just like old times, this is...)</textEffects> We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene!
</line><line>Gregson:
Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, that special dispensation... <textEffects>(The professor mentioned that, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes.

But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we?

Eh?
</line><line>Iris:
Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy?

Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo?

I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
About what?

About Mr Reaper!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? <textEffects>(Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.)</textEffects> Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he?

Here, this is what you need!

What's this? <textEffects>(Some kind of entrance ticket?)</textEffects> 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me?

You don't know it?! It's the most popular <textEffects>attraction</textEffects> in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like?

No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow!
</line><line>Iris:

What? At, at this popular London attraction?

Yes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

Hurley told me. But he told me to <textEffects>keep it a secret</textEffects> from you, Runo.

</line><line>Iris:
They're all <textEffects>wax models</textEffects>. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere!

...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif-

AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Iris:
What now?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display.
</line><line>Iris:
None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them!
</line><line>Iris:
Oh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait.

</line><line>Sholmes:
Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Temporary waxwork? What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me!
</line><line>Iris:
But Runo has something he needs to ask you.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah...a question?
</line><line>Iris:
And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Thank goodness we arrived in time.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss!
</line><line>Iris:
Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you?

<textEffects>(He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.)</textEffects>

Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now.

Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust?
</line><line>And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together.

<line>Ryunosuke:
So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person.

I was sure that you'd know, Hurley.

You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about.

I hope...you are appreciating my museum?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- <textEffects>(Not again!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tusspells:
My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Is that significant somehow?
</line><line>Tusspells:
I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right...
</line><line>Tusspells:
Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tusspells:
I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble.
</line><line>Iris:
She sounds deadly serious.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?)</textEffects>

Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean.

Yes, I know, but...

<line>Ryunosuke:
Um, I wonder...could I ask you something?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Bien sûr...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. <i>[sic]</i> Some kind of incident, perhaps?
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! <textEffects>(He's disappeared!)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Th-There you are!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down?
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead!
</line><line>Tusspells:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Why ever not?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(She's turned as white as a sheet...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance!
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain?
</line><line>Tusspells:
That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Nothing amiss, madame? What about <textEffects>the arm</textEffects> protruding ominously from under the curtain?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens.
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sholmes:
I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak <textEffects>graveyard</textEffects> scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is <textEffects>nowhere to be seen</textEffects>. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Why...? Why would you say that?
</line><line>Sholmes:
And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime!
</line><line>Tusspells:
AAAAAAH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(She looks as pale as candle wax...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tusspells:
I, I don't understand...
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.

<center><b>The Great Deduction</b>
The game is afoot!</center>
<line>
<b>Topic 1</b>
Waxwork's Fate
</line><line>Sholmes:
To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.
</line><line>Tusspells:
That, that is all my own money!
</line><line>Sholmes:
So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that <textEffects><b>public notice</b></textEffects>! '<textEffects>Waxwork for sale</textEffects>'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold <textEffects>the infamous killer</textEffects> - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Nooooooooon!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?
</line><line>Tusspells:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <textEffects><b>two hundred pounds</b></textEffects>! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively.
</line><line>Tusspells:
What are you suggesting?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret...
</line><line><b>Topic 1</b>
Waxwork's Fate
</line><line><b>Conclusion</b>
Sold for cash
</line><line>
<b>Topic 2</b>
Waxwork Location
</line><line>Sholmes:
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
</line><line>Tusspells:
You, you cannot possibly...
</line><line>Sholmes:
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <textEffects><b>neckerchief</b></textEffects>. Such as is worn by policemen as <textEffects>a secret sign</textEffects> to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay.
</line><line>Tusspells:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Sholmes:
The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards.
</line><line>Tusspells:
But...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah! But, but you...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <textEffects><b>price tag</b></textEffects>! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame?
</line><line>Tusspells:
I, I do not...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon!
</line><line><b>Topic 2</b>
Waxwork Location
</line><line><b>Conclusion</b>
Discovered already
</line><line>Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Iris:
.........
</line><line>Tusspells:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
I see I've stunned you all into silence.
</line><line>Iris:
You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly <textEffects>ruthless murderer</textEffects>, wouldn't it?
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... The killer policeman, Ottermole.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether.
</line><line>Iris:
And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
S-So...it is quite a lot then.
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions...
</line><line>Iris:
Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
She definitely looked in this direction, it's true.
</line><line>Iris:
But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh?
</line><line>Iris:
She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.)</textEffects> W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance.
</line><line>Iris:
Let's follow that <textEffects>furtive glance</textEffects> again and see if there's anything else that could explain it!
</line>




<line>
</line>




<line>The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that <textEffects><b>public notice</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Iris:
Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...)</textEffects> But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure.
</line><line>Iris:
...Then let's have more of a look around!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that <textEffects><b>ransom note</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Agh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it.
</line><line>Tusspells:
The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have...
</line><line>Sholmes:
In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is <textEffects>ransom money</textEffects>! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?
</line><line>Tusspells:
.........

Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <textEffects><b>two hundred pounds</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is?
</line><line>Iris:
We could just ask him when he comes around.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris.
</line><line>Iris:
Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around...
</line>




<line>
</line>




<line>What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <textEffects><b>two hundred pounds</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious.
</line><line>Iris:
Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. <textEffects>(Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <textEffects><b>waxwork hand</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow.
</line><line>Tusspells:
How, how could you...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's <textEffects>a left hand</textEffects>.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model!
</line><line>Tusspells:
KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you mean, that arm...?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, no small keepsake.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms...
</line><line>Tusspells:
I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our <textEffects>conclusion</textEffects>: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped!

<b>Topic 2</b>
Waxwork Location
</line><line><b>Conclusion</b>

</line><line>Sholmes:
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
</line><line>Tusspells:
You, you cannot possibly...
</line><line>Sholmes:
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <textEffects><b>neckerchief</b></textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is <textEffects>a sign</textEffects> to other policemen that some crime is underway.
</line><line>Iris:
A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away.
</line><line>Iris:
Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly.
</line>



<line>
</line>



<line>Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <textEffects><b>neckerchief</b></textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible.
</line><line>Iris:
But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <textEffects><b>shoulder stub</b></textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes.
</line><line>Tusspells:
He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Naturally! What other explanation could there be?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Ah! But, but you...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <textEffects><b>price tag</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known?
</line><line>Iris:
It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...)</textEffects> So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really?
</line><line>Iris:
Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up!
</line>



<line>
</line>



<line>The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <textEffects><b>price tag</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Iris:
If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think?
</line><line>Iris:
Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <textEffects><b>twitch</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence?
</line><line>Sholmes:
No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! <textEffects>The secret sign</textEffects> used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such <textEffects>criminal activity</textEffects> happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective.
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The waxwork of the especially <textEffects>ruthless killer</textEffects> from the special exhibit has been kidnapped.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!

<line>Tusspells:
All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe.
</line><line>Sholmes:
It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted?
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Yes. Tragically, it was...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please.
</line><line>Tusspells:
...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work.
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish...

<line>Tusspells:
It was <textEffects>a series of gruesome murders</textEffects> that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to <textEffects>the victims</textEffects> he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest.
</line><line>Iris:
What do you mean, Hurley?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with <textEffects>noble blood</textEffects>!
</line><line>Iris:
Oh gosh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit.
</line><line>Tusspells:
I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you.
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Tomorrow the court will decide.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I must warn you...
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Yes.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.
