Athena:
Good morning, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good morning. Chipper as ever this morning, I see.
</line><line>Athena:
I'm just thankful we actually get to have a trial for Orla. As a matter of fact, I just ran a few laps around the courthouse to get extra pumped!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And I just splashed my face with some water to get the sleep out of my eyes...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, I also cued the Swashbuckler video so we can watch it any time.
</line><line><textEffects>Swashbuckler Video added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks. It just might help our case. By the way, you have some serious dark circles. Did you stay up late watching this?
</line><line>Athena:
What?! M-Me? No, I, uh, just woke up early, that's all. ...Guess I need to cover them up. I get ragged on enough as it is by Prosecutor Blackquill.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Speaking of being pumped, I'm pretty fired up for this trial, too. It's been a while.
</line><line>Athena:
Hee hee. That explains why your hair is spikier than usual. I mean, look at it! It's all super pokey and prickly and stuff. It's amazing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...That was a compliment... right?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Good luck, Mr. Nick! I'll be cheering you on from the gallery.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks, Pearls. It's been so long, I'm actually a little nervous.
</line><line>Rimes:
Good morning, Mr. Lawyer!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Mr. Rimes! You came to watch the trial?
</line><line>Rimes:
Yeah. Sasha is back at the aquarium with the orca... ...so I thought I'd better come here to watch for her.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, don't you worry! We're going to win for Orla! Isn't that right, Boss?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Right. One unprecedented trial, coming right up!)</textEffects>
</line>

District Court - Courtroom No. 4</textEffects></center>
<line>
</line>
<center><b>Day 1</b><b>Court Is Now In Session</b><b>All Rise</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Orla Shipley.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ Must we waste words on this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Prosecutor Simon Blackquill... Known as the "Twisted Samurai," he's a prosecutor who's also a convicted felon. They say he never conducts a trial without his loyal hawk Taka by his side.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Mr. Wright, it's been quite a while since I've seen you like that. The lawyer image suits you. You look younger somehow. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. And you look as young as ever yourself. 
</line><line>Judge:
Ha ha ha. Well, I have to keep up with you folks, after all. By the way, has the defendant arrived in court yet?
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Surely you jest, Your Baldness. Did you not receive the memo? The defendant, Ora Shipley, is an <textEffects>orca</textEffects> at Shipshape Aquarium. 
</line><line>Judge:
A-An orcaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Arrangements for this trial were made only yesterday, so I didn't have time to review. But an orca as a defendant? It's patently absurd!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph......... Direct your comments to the defense. He's the absurd fellow who insisted on <textEffects>defending the orca in court</textEffects> in the first place.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Absurd or not, I will carry out my duty to defend my client. 
</line><line>Judge:
Your duty to defend your "crying ant"? Don't you mean your "crying orca," Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Blackquill:
If we are to proceed, we must treat the orca as we would any other defendant. Every soul -- be it of man or beast -- is of equal value. The question is whether that soul is painted in black or white. Take Taka for example. He is as human in spirit as you or I. 
</line><line>Taka:
*Screech!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The real question is, am I in for more pain... as always?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Orca or not, I suppose the defendant is still a defendant. And I vow to render my verdict fairly and impartially! *ahem* Now then, Prosecutor Blackquill, your opening statement, if you would.
</line><line>Blackquill:
I suppose I can hardly leave it to someone who knew nothing of the defendant... Very well. Listen carefully. The orca murdered the owner of Shipshape Aquarium in the aquarium's orca pool. The orca apparently toyed with the victim mercilessly as he died.
</line><line>Judge:
A sadistic orca... What a chilling thought. And where exactly is this defendant now?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Inside this.
</line><line>Judge:
A-A cell phone, Prosecutor Blackquill?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... Time marches on, Your Baldness -- with or without us. I borrowed this TV phone from the aquarium, which will allow us to interact with the orca.
</line><line>Judge:
A "TV phone"? Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>TV Phone added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
We will be able to view the defendant in question on this large monitor. Fool Bright, prepare for transmission.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! You've got it, Prosecutor Blackquill!
</line><line>Blackquill:
We will proceed with the defendant on telecast.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Buckler:
Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweeeet!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, it's quite cute, isn't it? And this adorable creature is suspected of killing a man...?
</line><line>Athena:
Orla's really pouring on the charm, huh!
</line><line>Blackquill:
She is far from "cute." She is a violent, reckless animal. 
</line><line>Fulbright:
That's right! The name's Bobby Fulbright, and I'll take over the explaining from here. Now, if I could direct your attention to this diagram of the crime scene. Following the report of an orca attack, we the police raced on over to Shipshape Aquarium. There, we found a guest who says she saw the orca and the victim from the visitor's corridor. As the witness was watching, the orca suddenly went crazy and attacked the victim. The orca was the only one there; therefore, no one else could have committed the crime. It's not quite finished, but I have a portion of the autopsy report here.
</line><line><textEffects>Shipley's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I can't imagine the terror of being attacked underwater by such a large creature...
</line><line>Blackquill:
But attack it did. Prepare yourself for the grisly details, Your Baldness. The prosecution moves to introduce our witness. ...Fool Bright.
</line><line>Fulbright:
You got it, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust! One brave lady whose fine sense of justice compelled her to speak, coming right up!
</line><line>DePlume:
How dare you make me wait? Don't you know I'm a busy woman?! I could have written an entire book for all the time I spent in that lobby!
</line><line>Judge:
Um... Prosecutor Blackquill?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Well?
</line><line>DePlume:
I am Norma DePlume, and I'm a nonfiction writer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Am I the only one who isn't telepathic here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Looks like she can read into people's words just as well as I can read into people's hearts.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not everything needs to be a competition, Athena...
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Norma DePlume?! The great nonfiction writer, Ms. Norma DePlume herself?! I've read all of your works and enjoyed them immensely. Your million seller, "The Great Grief of the Great Thief," is one of my favorites.
</line><line>DePlume:
Oh, are you a fan, Your Honor? I could give you my autograph, if you'd like.
</line><line>Judge:
Wait a second... I could swear you looked much different in the photos in your book......
</line><line>DePlume:
Well, I use ones from ten years ago in my books so that paparazzi won't harass me.
</line><line>Judge:
...! 
</line><line>Athena:
The judge seems to be shocked.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The visual disconnect must really be doing a number on His Honor's head...
</line><line>DePlume:
Could we get started, please? If I find you to be lacking as a judge... ...you will see your debut in my books!
</line><line>Judge:
Such harsh comments...! You really MUST be the real Norma DePlume.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who knew Ms. DePlume was so famous?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Enough jabbering. Tell the court what you saw, and keep it brief.
</line><line>DePlume:
I would thank you to not order me around. I am perfectly willing to tell everyone what I witnessed. It was the <textEffects>moment of the murder</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well, then. Please proceed with your testimony.

<line>DePlume:
I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.
As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!
I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!
Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately. 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The adorable defendant really did all that?! Hmm... It must be much more vicious than it looks...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Now, deliver your judgment so I may carry out the sentence. 
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... the defense would like to do some defending first, if that's all right...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... Must you drag this out with your tomfoolery?
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
The defense always has the right to cross-examine the witness, you know!
</line><line>Blackquill:
A fellow inmate told me just this morning... "If you want something signed, all you need is the document and a witness."
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Let me guess. They were convicted for contract fraud, right?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............ All we need in this case is the evidence and a witness to convict. It's as simple as that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like I guessed right.)</textEffects> Sorry, but as Ms. Cykes said... ...the defense has every right to cross-examine. Isn't that correct, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, of course. You may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........I shall relish the sight of you thrashing around in vain.

<line>DePlume:
<textEffects>Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The important thing here is, did she really see the "<span style="color:#E16935">moment of the murder</textEffects>"?)</span>
</line><line>Athena:
You're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.
</line><line>DePlume:
I beg your pardon?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The autopsy report does indeed say, "Death thought to be result of orca attack"... ...but the actual cause of death is "<textEffects>contusion from head trauma</textEffects>," not "being bitten"!
</line><line>DePlume:
What?! B-But...! But... I'm sure the victim was bitten!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't believe that can be true. The security footage doesn't show anything of the kind.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ Just as I suspected. I knew you would peek at the footage behind Fool Bright's back.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Well, what did you expect when he wouldn't play nice and share?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
But, unfortunately for you... ...the footage you saw was only one small part.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Yesterday, after I decided to take this case to trial, I re-reviewed all of the evidence. Taka, the evidence I gave to you for safekeeping.
</line><line>Taka:
*Screech!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Guess that hawk is higher up on the pecking order than Fulbright in Blackquill's book.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Let's view the footage. Wh-What's this?! The orca is biting the victim!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No waaaaaay!
</line><line>Judge:
I have to say that this appears to be very damning evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Security Footage updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
No... I can't believe Orla really bit him!
</line><line>Blackquill:
And there is more... Look at this. This photograph was taken while the body was being examined.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... There seems to be a <textEffects>strange bruise</textEffects> on the victim's right wrist.
</line><line>Blackquill: 
I'll have the crime lab examine the bruise and calculate its relevance to the case at hand. What's important right now is evidence that points to the orca as the killer. Look at the left side of the body. See <textEffects>the orca's tooth marks</textEffects> in the victim's clothes?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes! They do appear to suggest that she did, in fact, bite the victim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line><textEffects>Photo of the Body updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
I told you so! And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
H-However! In the autopsy report, the cause of death is "contusion from head trauma"!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
You are much too impetuous, Wright-dono. Granted, the orca biting the victim was not the cause of death. The witness was mistaken about that.
</line><line>Judge:
Then what explanation is there for what the witness saw?!
</line><line>Blackquill: 
Did I not say in the beginning, "The orca toyed with the victim mercilessly"?
</line><line>Judge:
M-My goodness!
</line><line>Blackquill: 
After killing the victim, the defendant swam around with his dead body in her mouth. Just like any other predator toying with its prey!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Nrgh...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! The hearts of the people in the gallery are suddenly filled with fear -- fear of Orla!
</line><line>Judge:
So the defendant bit the victim after she had killed him... But if that's the case, then we must still figure out how the defendant killed the victim. Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have a sound theory to give to this court?
</line><line>Blackquill: 
I wouldn't be standing here if I couldn't prove whether the orca's heart was black or white.
</line><line>Athena:
But Orla is <textEffects>black AND white</textEffects>! ...Her body, I mean.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena, please try not to provoke Prosecutor Blackquill.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The witness also observed the actual <textEffects>moment of the murder</textEffects>. Think back, Word Mistress. Think back to what you observed before the orca bit the victim.
</line><line>DePlume:
...Ah, I see what you're driving at. So that was the true <textEffects>moment of the murder</textEffects>, was it?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Now, explain it in a way that even these simpletons can understand.
</line><line>DePlume:
There you go again, ordering me around! Stop that this instant! But whatever... I don't mind telling my story. I saw the killer whale before it toyed with the body as well. I saw it the moment it killed the victim by <textEffects>head-butting</textEffects> him!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Orla killed the victim by head-butting him?!
</line><line>DePlume:
That's right. It rammed the victim over and over again.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Recall that the autopsy report stated that there were <textEffects>bruises all over his body</textEffects>. Recall as well, how persistent the defendant can be when she's attacking her prey.
</line><line>DePlume:
And we all just saw the killer whale head-butting the victim in the footage, don't forget.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... That footage backs up Ms. DePlume's testimony... But there's also something very important it does NOT show...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
Now do you see what a menace this killer whale is?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but I can't allow your testimony to stand unchallenged. Looking at this footage, the orca certainly seems to be head-butting something... ...but you'll note that the "something" is not the victim!
</line><line>DePlume:
Oh! ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I want to look away... but I can't...)</textEffects>. Even if it was the victim, you couldn't have seen him from where you were, could you?
</line><line>DePlume:
............What? O-Oh. Well... I suppose not...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume, did you actually witness the victim getting head-butted by the defendant?
</line><line>DePlume:
Ah, let's see... Oh, I remember now! As I recall, a rock in the shape of a skull was obstructing my view.
</line><line>Judge:
So are you admitting that you couldn't see the victim?
</line><line>DePlume:
Yes... Yes, I suppose I am. However! Immediately after the head-butting, the victim came floating up! He came up from behind the skull-shaped rock, and his body was all limp. What else could I think except that the killer whale was head-butting the victim?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But if you didn't actually see the moment of attack itself, then it's pure conjecture!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
*sigh* Must I do everything around here?
</line><line>DePlume:
H-How dare you speak so rudely to me?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
There's no need for hysterics. Clear your mind and recall how you reached your conclusion. Though you couldn't see what the orca was attacking, you didn't need to, did you? Because you knew she was behaving exactly as she had only <textEffects>one year prior</textEffects>.
</line><line>DePlume:
Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(One year ago...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
That's right! Yes, that's it! That's how I knew the killer whale was head-butting the victim! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but could someone explain exactly what happened a year ago?
</line><line>Blackquill:
If you must know, a very similar incident occurred only last year, in which... ...the defendant murdered her trainer. 
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! The orca murdered her trainer, you say?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Is this really true?! <textEffects>(This is not looking good for us!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
It's all in this book. 
</line><line>Judge:
That book... "<textEffects>The Killer Killer Whale</textEffects>"...! That's Ms. DePlume's latest work! I was just thinking of picking that up.
</line><line><textEffects>"The Killer Killer Whale" added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Last year, the defendant killed her trainer in the middle of a show. The orca <textEffects>head-butted</textEffects> and <textEffects>bit</textEffects> the victim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The same thing she's accused of in this case!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woman:
</line>
<center>That orca killed two people?!</center>
<line>
Man:
</line>
<center>That thing is a menace! Guilty! Guilty, I say!</center>

<textEffects>(We were doing so well, but now... Now everyone in the room has a bad impression of Orla. I don't want to think she did it... ...but it's hard to keep on believing in somebody who can't even tell me her side...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet?
</line><line>Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe in Orla! There's no way she killed anybody! You gotta save her! Please, I'm begging you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sasha... <textEffects>(What am I doing, doubting my client like this? This is the time to be strong!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
I believe in Orla! And I'm ready to fight for our clients! I'll take everybody in this courtroom on if I have to!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't you worry, Sasha. We won't give up on Orla. We'll defend her to the very end!
</line><line>Buckler:
Thank you! Thank you, both of you!
</line><line>Orla:
Fweet, fweet!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(We are Orla's lawyers. Who else but us can save her?! We can't give up on her now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... For an instant there, you were afraid of the orca, weren't you, Wright-dono. When you saw the photograph of the victim from a year ago, you turned paler than me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
! <textEffects>(He saw right through me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
It's obvious you have neither the guts nor the determination to defend the orca.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's true that Orla can't speak, and I don't know her thoughts... ...but there's a certain someone who believes in Orla with all her heart. I respect the trust she has in Orla, so I'm willing to believe in Orla, too.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. And what do you know about orcas? Nothing, that's what. So, allow me to fill you in. Do you have any idea why orcas are also called "<textEffects>killer whales</textEffects>"? Because they are cunning and merciless predators that hunt and kill even true whales.
</line><line>Judges:
So "killer whales" really are "<textEffects>killers</textEffects>"! What terrifying creatures indeed...
</line><line>Blackquill:
I can't bear to hear any more of such rubbish as "trusting a killer." Can you, Your Baldness?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No matter what you say, I will continue to believe. I don't give up that easily, you know.
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Dullard. You don't know when to give up, do you? Very well. I shall give you a chance to prove just how determined you are. Witness, spare no quarter and lay the full truth on them.
</line><line>DePlume:
Oh ho ho! But of course! That is what I do, after all. 
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, what will you have the witness testify about?
</line><line>Blackquill:
I shall have her testify about what she saw, and <textEffects>what she heard</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What she heard...?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Ms. DePlume, please tell the court what you saw and what you heard.

<line>DePlume:
The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago. 
As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing.
I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.
But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream! 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So the orca displayed the same behavior as during the incident a year ago...
</line><line>DePlume:
That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was <textEffects>singing</textEffects>! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the <textEffects>Swashbuckler Spectacular song</textEffects>! That's right. It was singing the same song it sang in the aquarium's stage show back then. It was singing while it was head-butting! Oh, it was perfectly horrible! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... I don't see a single obvious inconsistency in this testimony. It's clear I won't be able to take her apart her statements with evidence alone.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! Now would be a good time for me to put my skills to work! It's time to show what analytical psychology can really do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You seem pretty confident. Let me guess. You noticed a contradiction between the testimony and her emotions?
</line><line>Athena:
You bet I did! And once we expose it, we just might be able to crack her. No, scratch that. Make it, "we'll definitely be able to"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then let's give your knowledge of analytical psychology a try!
</line><line>Athena:
You got it, Boss! A complete analysis of Ms. DePlume's heart, coming right up!

Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how <textEffects>strong</textEffects> they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume, Orla really <textEffects>frightened</textEffects> you with her head-butting, didn't she?
</line><line>DePlume:
Don't be absurd! I certainly was NOT frightened by the likes of any killer whale!
</line><line>Athena:
It must've been something else that scared her, then, Boss.
</line><line>DePlume:
However... I do remember being very afraid for some reason while it was doing that. 
</line><line>Athena:
It sounds like maybe you saw something we haven't discussed yet. Take your time and try to remember what it was... What did you see?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is practically turning into a counseling session.)</textEffects>

Okay, good! Now, if you could please tell the court what you saw!
</line><line>DePlume:
I saw... I saw... I saw... <textEffects>bright red blood</textEffects>! The killer whale's ramming caused the victim to bleed. There was a great cloud of blood!
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>DePlume:
Yes, that's it! That's why I was so sure! That's when I knew that killer whale had killed a person for a second time!
</line><line>Judge:
Well! That was a very compelling statement indeed. Looking at this again, there does appear to be something that could be a cloud of blood.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So her terror was a reaction to <span style="color:#E16935">blood</textEffects>, was it? That would certainly explain what happened yesterday...)</span>
</line>

Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.
</line><line>DePlume:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of man shows a lady blood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk. <textEffects>(She doesn't have to get so worked up...)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>DePlume:
I was badly injured during an interview once. Ever since then, I've been terrified of blood. The very sight of it dreadfully upsets my delicate sensibilities.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is a bad turn... If Ms. DePlume saw blood... ...then does that mean Orla really did attack the victim...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
It would appear that orcas are even more vicious than I am. So, how does it feel to be thoroughly rammed by your own cross-examination, Wright-dono?
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What do we do now, Boss?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Argh... That testimony was not at all what I expected to hear...
</line><line>Athena:
Wait a minute... There's still some discord left in Ms. DePlume's heart. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? You mean there's more?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, but there's no telling what it is. It could be something even more damaging...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh... Is there even anything left of our case to damage...? Well, whatever it is, we have to face it head-on.)</textEffects> Athena, you believe in Orla, right? If so, there's no reason for us to shy away from the truth.
</line><line>Athena:
...Yeah, you're right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know we can handle the truth, whatever it is, so let's delve a little deeper!
</line><line>Athena:
You've got it, Boss!

</line><line>DePlume:
My, that's a very good question. I was shaken after witnessing a murder, yes, but then... the blood seemed to <textEffects>disappear</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Disappear? And why do you suppose that was?
</line><line>DePlume:
Simple! It was because of the pirate hat! After the killer whale put the hat on, the cloud of blood disappeared!

<textEffects>(Wait a minute... From whom was this <span style="color:#E16935">blood</textEffects> that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Consider this. Maybe the one who was bleeding wasn't the victim.
</line><line>DePlume:
I beg your pardon? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? There was no one else in that pool beside the victim!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I wouldn't say there was <textEffects>no one else</textEffects>. It IS an orca pool, after all.
</line><line>Blackquill:
What?! Then where is this alleged injury on the defendant?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not sure. But if simply wearing the pirate hat made the blood "disappear"... ...then the blood must've been coming from somewhere on Orla's head!
</line><line>DePlume:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca's head? What are you prattling on about now?!
</line><line>Athena:
Please think about it again, Ms. DePlume! Think back to what you really saw!

Well! This is a surprise! The blood the witness saw was the defendant's, not the victim's!

</line><line>Blackquill:
I thought you were unarmed, but it turns out you were concealing a sword all along. Nevertheless... it is far too dull to cut to the bone. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Meaning...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
I grant that what the witness saw was not the victim's blood, but it proves nothing. After all, being rammed doesn't always result in a wound that bleeds, does it? Death from internal hemorrhaging is also a possibility.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(He has a point there.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
If you wish to challenge me to a duel, you'll need a sharper blade than that, Wright-dono. I demand <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that proves the witness <textEffects>did not see the moment of the murder</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! <textEffects>(There must be something. Think, Phoenix! If I'm correct, then the victim's death occurred...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would mean he died sometime before Ms. DePlume was watching her.

<textEffects>(We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM. Which means... there's still footage going further back that we need to check!)</textEffects> Your Honor, I request that ALL of the security footage be played for the court.
</line><line>Judge:
All of the footage?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume witnessed the cloud of blood at <textEffects>around 10:10 AM</textEffects>. But I believe the victim was already dead by that time. 
</line><line>Judge:
So your assertion is that the murder took place <textEffects>before</textEffects> Ms. DePlume arrived?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. The security camera footage starts at 10:00 AM when the aquarium opened. And I believe there is vital evidence in the <textEffects>ten minutes before</textEffects>!

Hmph............ You are quite the gambling man, Wright-dono. Are you honestly willing to risk everything on those mere ten minutes?

</line><line>Fulbright:
Huh? What do you mean by that?

In this ten minutes of footage, something important that SHOULD be there isn't there! Detective Fulbright, this footage should have been submitted as evidence.
</line><line>Fulbright:
What? Are you questioning the way I carry out my duty to justice?!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Explain yourself, please! <textEffects>What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley. I don't know about you, but I didn't see him get in the pool in that footage.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Aaaaagh! That's right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the victim is not shown entering the pool in this footage... ...it means that he must have been there by the skull rock during those ten minutes. But no human being can hold their breath underwater for that long. 
</line><line>Fulbright:
W-Wait a minute... Are you saying...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
When the security camera started up at 10 AM, the victim was already dead!
</line><line>Fulbright:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! If that's the case, then when was the victim murdered?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know, Your Honor, but we now know it had to have been sometime before 10 AM. Therefore, this footage can no longer be called decisive evidence against my client!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. But there is no one else who could have killed the victim. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not necessarily. The defense believes that the true culprit may have been human. And we have evidence to back up our theory as well!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Do you, now? I would be very interested in seeing this evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The defense's trump card -- that thing we found during our investigation yesterday... I wouldn't go so far as to call it "decisive," but... ...now's the time to play it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please submit your evidence. <textEffects>What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
What's this? A coin...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, a fake coin used in the aquarium's pirate show. We found it beside the pool. This coin is quite possibly the real <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
This tiny little coin... is the murder weapon? Mr. Wright! If this is another one of your bluffs...!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. As they say, the bolder the presentation, the less confident the solicitor. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is no bluff, and this isn't the only coin. There are 300 of these coins all together, weighing a total of about seven pounds. This one just happens to have <textEffects>blood</textEffects> on it. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Did you have the blood analyzed to see whose it is?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not yet... ...but there were coins scattered all around the body, and the victim had a head wound. Taking these things into account, I believe it has to be the victim's blood. So, to put it together, we have about seven pounds of coins by the side of the pool... ...one of them with a bloodstain on it. I think the answer is pretty clear here. Your Honor! The defense proposes that the victim was killed beside the pool! 
</line><line>Judge:
The side of the pool?! But if the murder took place there, it would be difficult to say the orca did it...
</line><line>DePlume:
I realize you are trying to defend your client, but that theory is preposterous! How could 300 coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It'd be pretty easy if they were in a bag or something of that nature.
</line><line>Judge:
And so where is this bag the coins were in?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unfortunately, Your Honor, we recovered nothing of the sort from the scene. It's possible the culprit took it with them.
</line><line>Judge:
They took it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The true culprit used the coins as a blunt instrument to commit murder. They then threw the body into the pool before the security cameras started up. And then they left, taking the bag the coins were in with them. They got rid of the evidence that points to a human culprit to pin the blame on Orla!
</line><line>Athena:
That was brilliant, Mr. Wright! You found a way to introduce the possibility of a human perpetrator!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, somehow... <textEffects>(Let's hope my luck holds out... Hmm... I wonder why Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't said anything...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The possibility of a perpetrator other than the defendant has now been suggested. But if we hold this possibility to be true, then what did Ms. DePlume witness?
</line><line>DePlume:
Th-That's right! I saw the killer whale attack the victim! Just like it did a year ago, singing a song!
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... I guess there still is that... Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seem <i>[sic]</i> pretty bizarre. I wonder why did she <i>[sic]</i> was doing the same things she did a year ago?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But are they REALLY that bizarre...?
</line><line>Athena:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
To explain the inexplicable, all we have to do is <textEffects>turn our thinking around</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Turn our thinking around, huh? Sounds good to me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Time to give the ol' "<span style="color:#E16935">turn my thinking around</textEffects>" method a try! Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider <textEffects>the results that were produced</textEffects> by her behavior this time around. Orla sang a <textEffects>song</textEffects>, did some <textEffects>head-butts</textEffects>, and <textEffects>bit</textEffects> the victim. If the real culprit wanted to shift the suspicion onto Orla... ...then they would've needed to give people a reason to <textEffects>think Orla did it</textEffects> in the first place!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, as her lawyer, how do you explain your client's actions?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe we should think of it in this way, Your Honor: <textEffects>What kind of effect did Orla's actions have on the case?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Then why don't you explain it for the court. <textEffects>How did the defendant's actions affect the case?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song. The orca's act of singing a song created a <textEffects>witness</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Judge:
Created a witness...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Isn't it possible... ...that fabricating a witness was the real culprit's true intention? After all, Ms. DePlume witnessed two things: She saw Orla <textEffects>head-butt</textEffects> something over and over, and she saw the orca <textEffects>bite the victim</textEffects>. Those two actions of Orla's might have been... ...the true culprit's plot to make the witness think the orca was attacking the victim!
</line><line>Judge:
Are you saying... that the defendant was being manipulated by the true perpetrator?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. And that would explain Orla's actions perfectly.
</line><line>Judge:
But the defendant is an orca. Is it even possible to manipulate her?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Is this... a whistle?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Trainers at the aquarium use whistles to issues commands to Orla. But in truth, anyone can do it, provided they know the right signals.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, that must be how they get Orla to do tricks for their pirate shows.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The true culprit hid the body in a spot that couldn't be seen from the visitor's corridor. Then, when Ms. DePlume appeared, they gave Orla the commands! In other words, Orla was manipulated by the culprit to perform a series of "tricks"!
</line><line>DePlume:
Wh-Whaaat...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And, as for you, Ms. DePlume... ...you were manipulated by the true culprit to play the part of the witness!
</line><line>DePlume:
I-I, Norma DePlume, was set up...?! I, Norma DePlume, writer extraordinaire, was used...? N-No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Ms. DePlume...! Please do something about your attire!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh... That was one wardrobe malfunction I did NOT want to see...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I-It would appear we need to shift our suspicion toward someone other than Orla. Prosecutor Blackquill, please have the bloodstained coin analyzed. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. You waste your breath.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess even Prosecutor Blackquill can't refute the possibility of a human suspect.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
You did it, Boss! If the crime happened beside the pool, there's no way an <textEffects>orca</textEffects> could have done it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, if only we could find the bag the coins were in...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... In light of the new discovery, it would appear that the orca couldn't have done it. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. If the blood on the coin proves to be that of the victim... ...we can unequivocally overturn Orla's accusation.
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Overturn the defendant's accusation...? Hmph. I think not.
</line><line>Phoenix:
ACK! <textEffects>(M-My hair! My beautiful hair!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Yesterday, a new inmate was brought into the prison. He said, "The moment you relax is when you're most vulnerable."
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... And what did this man go in for?
</line><line>Blackquill:
...He is merely a sneaky thief who enjoys a spot of fishing now and again. But Wright-dono here would be easier to hook than any fish... 
</line><line>Taka:
*Screech!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That hawk sure does love the judge's head.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What's this? That coin from before and... some sort of <textEffects>bag</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A b-bag...? <textEffects>(I don't think I'm gonna like this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
This is the <textEffects>coin bag</textEffects> the 300 coins were in. I believe you were looking for this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-How did you get that?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
I never said we didn't find it at the crime scene. The bag had blood on it, so naturally, I had it sent to the crime lab.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And... does the blood belong to the victim?
</line><line>Blackquill:
It does indeed, as does the blood on the coin.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I knew it! So the blood on the coin DID belong to the victim!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
The bag was open and the coins had all spilled out. But the bag alone wasn't proof enough to say that it was used as the murder weapon. ...However, thanks to the defense and their coin, I am more than satisfied that it was.
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill! Are you conceding that the true culprit committed the murder with the bag of coins?
</line><line>Blackquill:
I shall concede that the victim was put into the pool after his death. However, even with the bag... ...it doesn't change the fact it was the orca that killed the victim!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! How can you still suspect Orla?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
You said that <textEffects>the true culprit manipulated Orla's behavior</textEffects>. But Orla isn't the kind of orca that would let someone control her. If anything, <textEffects>Orla used the victim's behavior against him to murder him</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! But--
</line><line>Judge:
A-Are you arguing <textEffects>that the orca manipulated a human being</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... To prove it, I have summoned another witness. Marlon Rimes, take the stand!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(M-Marlon Rimes?! Is a witness...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Well, don't just stand there. State your name. 
</line><line>Rimes:
............I told ya I didn't wanna be a witness.
</line><line>Blackquill:
I thought one witness would be quite enough to prove the defendant's guilt... ...but apparently Wright-dono won't be satisfied until every stone is turned.
</line><line>Rimes:
Well, son of a... All right, fine! If I gotta talk, then let's get this over with!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Rimes doesn't seem like a willing witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wonder what Prosecutor Blackquill is going to have him testify about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Um... So could we have your name and occupation for the record, witness?
</line><line>Rimes:
............ Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! People of da law! Time to testify! Chillin' with my crew at the Shipshape. Orcas, penguins, and da seascape. Cleanin' n' feedin', there ain't no end. But dem bratty kid's tours, I shall transcend. Noob animal keeper, from the house of Rimes! I'm da master keeper, Marlon with the rhymes!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my... I'm afraid I couldn't understand a word you said! Is that that "flip-flop" music young people nowadays like?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...So close, Your Honor, so close... and yet so far.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony, witness. Without the flip-flop.
</line><line>Rimes:
Okay, fine. But I don't wanna do this, I tell ya. I feel like I'm sellin' Sasha out.

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<line><textEffects>-- The Man-Manipulating Orca -- </textEffects>
</line>
</center>
<line>Rimes:
At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.
I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.
I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.
The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.
I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... So that gives us a little more info about the area around the orca pool.)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.</textEffects> 
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defendant made the stuff fall down...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Overturned crates and assorted props were scattered all over the pool room floor. There is no doubt that it was the orca that caused the mess. 
</line><line>Judge:
But could she really have done that from within the pool?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've perform <i>[sic]</i> such a feat. The pool and its room were tidied the night before, including its various odds and ends. But when our rhyming marlin checked on the scene, over 400 pounds of props had fallen. To move it all in one go would challenge even the brawny prisoner in the cell next to mine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...What is he? The jail gossip?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
So, how did 400 pounds of items fall all at once? I'll tell you how. The orca pulled on the cloth that was underneath them. A weight that would be all but impossible for a human to move... ...was child's play to an orca. During a friendly game of volleyball, the defendant made the crates fall... ...and the bag of coins that was among the items fell on the victim's head and killed him! The orca then toyed with the victim's body underwater, which is what Ms. DePlume saw. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But the witness only said he "heard a loud noise." That doesn't automatically make it the sound of Orla making the items fall! Also, why did you only "look in" on the pool room, anyway, Mr. Rimes?
</line><line>Rimes:
That orca sometimes makes a loud noise to summon her trainer. But I'm still a newbie, so I don't have a <textEffects>security card</textEffects> to get into the pool room yet. So even if she tries to summon somebody, there isn't much I can do about it. 
</line><line>Judge:
I see. So the witness couldn't enter the crime scene...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
If Mr. Rimes couldn't enter the room, there's at least one thing he can't be sure about! His statement that the orca was playing volleyball is purely speculation!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Whether the orca was actually playing volleyball or not is not the issue. Traces of the orca's saliva were found on the cloth that was underneath the crates. The important point is that <textEffects>the orca is the only one that could have moved the items</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! I have to discredit that statement somehow! If I don't, it'd mean that Orla was the culprit, even if the victim died beside the pool!)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
You say you were in the staff room, but is that really true?
</line><line>Rimes:
Of course it's true. Why would I lie about a thing like that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, have you ever seen this calendar before?
</line><line>Rimes:
Hey! That's...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see you recognize it.
</line><line>Rimes:
Yeah, that's the Rifle calendar. It's a big hit at the Shipshape Aquarium gift shop. Thank you for shoppin' at Shipshape! 
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Rimes! Please refrain from scattering fish around the witness stand!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Not to worry, Your Baldness. Taka will have them cleaned up in no time.
</line><line>Taka:
*Screech!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...I guess that bird comes in handy now and then.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
All right, Mr. Wright. We have all seen your cute souvenir. Now, if you wouldn't mind...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, no, Your Honor! This isn't my calendar. It was originally the witness's, but it came into the possession of a certain young lady.
</line><line>Rimes:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes and this young lady first met each other in the food prep room. After a mishap, their calendars got switched around. They ran into each other at about 10:10 AM in the food prep room. So clearly, the witness was not in the staff room. In other words, there's no way he could have heard the noise in the pool room upstairs!
</line><line>Rimes:
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What's this? This is the first I'm hearing about any calendar! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's because Mr. Rimes and Pearls were keeping it a secret.)</textEffects>

You lied to ME?! This transgression will not go unpunished!
</line><line>Rimes:
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
</line><line>Judge:
So, Mr. Rimes, you didn't hear the noise of the equipment falling after all, did you?
</line><line>Rimes:
...Okay. I admit it. I didn't hear the noise in the orca pool room myself. But somebody told me about it. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who told you about it?
</line><line>Rimes:
............It was... uh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unless you tell the truth, Mr. Rimes, I can't save Orla. And I'm sure you know how sad that would make Ms. Buckler.
</line><line>Rimes:
............ ............I heard about it... from Sasha.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! From Ms. Buckler?!
</line><line>Athena:
B-But that doesn't make sense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is going on here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... Now it's the trainer's own words that drive the orca into a corner. How do you like being bitten by your own client, Wright-dono?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh! I certainly didn't see this coming!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
What perfect timing. There was something I wanted to ask Ms. Buckler about the orca. The prosecution calls the trainer, Ms. Sasha Buckler, to the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I suppose it would be a good idea to hear what the orca's trainer has to say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't know what Sasha is going to say... ...but I'll just have to meet it head-on, whatever it is!)</textEffects>

I guess "Nostache" refers to Prosecutor Blackquill this time.

I'm Sasha Buckler. I work at Shipshape Aquarium. I perform in our Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show alongside Orla, as her trainer.
</line><line>Judge:
Well! You seem like a completely different person now. 
</line><line>Buckler:
You r-EEL-y think so? Thanks! I was in my pirate show persona just then! Prosecutor Blackquill said I could introduce myself any way I like.

<textEffects>(I'd bet money he didn't think you were going to do it like THAT...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
And what will this witness testify about?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca manipulated the victim into playing volleyball and then knocked the items down. The witness will report about hearing <textEffects>the noise that caused the victim's death</textEffects>. 
</line><line>Buckler:
Now wait just a minute! Sure, Orla uses the ball to break props sometimes... She even spiked the ball at the giant octopus's leg yesterday when I was cleaning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...So Orla was the one who broke that leg, huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Buckler:
But she couldn't have knocked down that huge stack of equipment with her little ball!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. I thought you were paying attention to the trial over the telecast... ...but you apparently know nothing of what we have been discussing. The orca knocked down the equipment by pulling on the <textEffects>cloth</textEffects> that was underneath it. No one said anything about the orca knocking it down with a ball!
</line><line>Buckler:
Whaaaaaat?! I-Is THAT what we're talking about?! Ngh... I came in here to give Prosecutor Nostache a good keelhauling... ...but I'm the one getting the cat-o'-nine-tails! Ooh, he's as vicious as a tiger shark!

I admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.
But the aquarium guest's <textEffects>scream</textEffects> I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.
I talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.
The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.

<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Her story doesn't seem to be much different from Marlon Rimes's testimony. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Or does it...? The circumstances are different. The actual order of Orla's actions depend on the <textEffects>order</textEffects> the witness heard the two noises. If she heard the <textEffects>scream</textEffects> first, the prosecution's claims don't stand up!

I was distracted at the time... so I don't really recall which one I heard first... I was lost in thought until the guard brought me back to myself... Sorry I'm no help. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
As long as the order remains unclear, I shall not alter the prosecution's claims. After killing the victim with the bag of coins, the orca toyed with the body in the water.

Oh, you're right. It's written right here in the flyer for the new show. "Featuring the dashing Redstache, with a fluttering red scarf!" 
</line><line>Athena:
Although, I have to say, it just looks like a <textEffects>red scarf</textEffects> was added to his OLD costume...
</line><line>Buckler:
Yeah, well, the captain was never one to spend too much money on costumes... But, you know, the captain wasn't WEARING that red scarf...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But in this photo, I believe I see a red scarf...
</line><line>Buckler:
Yeah, but it's not wrapped around his neck. It's just draped on top of his neck. That red scarf was packed away with the rest of the new show's equipment. It must've fallen on top of the captain when the equipment fell down.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... I see...
</line><line>Judge:
It looks like your "discrepancy" wasn't really a "discrepancy" after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So the scarf doesn't have anything to do with the case? But there's something about the timing of the stuff falling that bothers me... Hold on. The <span style="color:#E16935">timing of the stuff falling</textEffects>... The <textEffects>timing</textEffects>... Maybe... my theory has been all wrong from the beginning! Maybe... the bag of coins isn't the murder weapon!)</span>        
</line><line>Blackquill:
Heh heh. And so your last cross-examination ends in failure as well. You should know that such a feeble slash will never hurt me.
As I said... the orca made the equipment fall and then toyed with the body in the water.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but based on the circumstances at the scene... ...the defendant couldn't have dragged the body into the water after the equipment fell. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmm? And why, pray tell, is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I'll tell you all right. <textEffects>(If my theory has been all wrong... then I'll just have to fix it!)</textEffects>    
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright. Please do tell the court. <textEffects>What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This red scarf <textEffects>fell at the same time as the bag of coins</textEffects>. But if the body was dragged into the pool after the bag of coins fell... ...then the red scarf wouldn't still be on top of the body! 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wh-What...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
In other words, the victim was already dead when the equipment came crashing down! Therefore, the bag of coins that fell with the red scarf was NOT the murder weapon!
</line><line>Blackquill:  
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
But it was the defense who claimed the bag of coins was the murder weapon to begin with!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... yes, that's true. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Do you intend to abandon your original argument?
</line><line>Phoenix:
After hearing the testimony, I realized my theory about the murder weapon was wrong. Please recall the facts we have learned so far. It's a fact that what Orla bit was the victim's dead body. 
</line><line>Judge:
After all, when we saw the victim on the security footage, he was already dead.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But then, Orla carried the victim's body to the side of the pool... ...and knocked down the equipment for the new pirate show that was piled up there. Maybe Orla was trying to alert the humans to the victim's condition. If Orla knocked the items down on the victim after he was <textEffects>already dead</textEffects>... ...then it means the defendant didn't kill the victim with those items!
</line><line>Blackquill:
BUT THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS! ............Even still, your argument is lacking... If neither the orca's head-butting nor the bag of coins were the manner of death... ...then how do you propose the victim was killed?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
A very good point. If the defense is now abandoning its original theory... ...then we would need a new theory as to what the murder weapon was.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh... A-All right... <textEffects>(I doubt "I have no clue" would go over well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
All right! Let's go over what we still need to find out about the victim's body.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What we don't know is <textEffects>how he died</textEffects> and <textEffects>why his body was at the bottom of the pool</textEffects>. I wonder if there's something that would explain both of those things at once?
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... How did the victim's body sink to the bottom of the pool...? On a diagram, it's easy enough to move the body to the bottom of the pool... ...but in real life, the <textEffects>water</textEffects> would just cause the body to float.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right... <textEffects>(Hold on... <span style="color:#E16935">Water</textEffects>? Okay. Then what if we flip that around? What if there was <textEffects>no water</textEffects>? Then the body would go right down in an instant. ...So could the real manner of death be...?!)</span> Thanks for the great hint, Athena. 
</line><line>Athena:
What? I helped you, and I didn't even know it?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! I think we know the real manner of the victim's death!
</line><line>Judge:
"I think" won't do, Mr. Wright. I expect a clear answer. Now then, what was the real manner of Jack Shipley's death?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's the manner of death that <span style="color:#E16935">moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant</textEffects>?)</span>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at this diagram of the pool. If there was no water in the pool... ...then it would be very easy to move the victim's body to the bottom of the pool. 
</line><line>Judge:
He would drop straight down... Oh, my! Could that be the true manner of death...?! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
The orca pool is about 65 feet deep. If the victim were to go from the top of the pool to the bottom when there was no water... ...then he would, without question, have <textEffects>fallen to his death</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
...Death from a fall...!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Ngh... And that's your answer...?
</line><line>Athena:
It all makes perfect sense! If he fell, that would explain the "signs of blunt force trauma all over the body," too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The culprit pushed the victim into the pool when there was no water in it. After doing something to keep the body from floating up, they filled the pool with water. The pool water washed away any signs of blood, so no one would realize that he fell!
</line><line>Judge:
S-Surprisingly, that actually makes sense! Order! Order in the court! I'm just as surprised as you are, but I must have order! If falling was the manner of death, then does that mean the defendant's behavior... ...was the result of being manipulated by the true culprit, as the defense claimed?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, it would have to be. All that needs to be explained now is how the real culprit commanded Orla! Ms. Buckler, is there a way to instruct Orla to bite someone? 
</line><line>Buckler:
What?! What kind of trick would that be?! Of course not!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then could you tell us about the tricks Orla does know?
</line><line>Buckler:
Well, there's jumping, dancing, and playing volleyball. And she can spin, do the rock 'n' roll trick, and sing the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Those sound like pretty nice tricks, but I doubt they're related to this case.)</textEffects>  
</line><line>Buckler:
She's also practicing two new, top-secret tricks. There's the "<textEffects>human rocket</textEffects>," where she shoots somebody up into the air. And then there's the "<textEffects>lifesaver</textEffects>" trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey! One of these "top-secret" tricks might have something to do with the case! Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?)</textEffects>     
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct? 
</line><line>Buckler:
You cod it! Orla's still learning how to hold someone gently in her mouth... ...so she sometimes bites into their clothes, but she's never hurt a person's skin. 
</line><line>Athena:
She brings a drowning person to the surface?! Then that must be it...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>DePlume:
And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
That matches up perfectly with what Ms. DePlume said in her testimony!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The real culprit must have used the lifesaver trick command to manipulate Orla!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I still find this very hard to believe. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then let's see it for ourselves. Let's have Orla show us her trick using a practice dummy.
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. As you wish. 
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution doesn't appear to have any objection. Ms. Buckler, please proceed.
</line><line>Buckler:
Okay, sure! I'll show you Orla's fin-omenal trick! Hey, Marlon! Are you ready over there?
</line><line>Rimes:
Okay, lemme just go get the practice dummy... ...There! It's in the pool! Ready and standin' by, Sasha!
</line><line>Buckler:
Here goes! Orla's secret new trick, the lifesaver!
</line><line><i>Anime cutscene</i>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rimes:
The clothes got torn up a little, but the dummy doesn't have any new marks on it!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet! Fwee, fweeeeet!
</line><line>Buckler:
And there you have it! Orla's secret new trick!
</line><line>Man:
</line>
<center>Wow! That orca is really something!</center>
<line>
Woman:
</line>
<center>A cute thing like that wouldn't hurt anybody!</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sounds like the gallery loved Orla's performance!)</textEffects>   
</line><line>Athena:
That was great! That awesome trick captured everybody's heart!
</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho ho! Wonderful! I wish I could see more!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............
</line><line>Athena:
Looks like we silenced Prosecutor Blackquill!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Orla and Ms. Buckler. And thank you, too, Mr. Rimes. And so now you can clearly see that Orla was manipulated. The bottom of the orca pool needs to be examined immediately! We might still find some evidence of the victim falling to his death!
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, please have that taken care of at once!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Uh, excuse me, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I am requesting further investigation...
</line><line>Blackquill:
............ GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Tsk, tsk, Prosecutor Blackquill! You have to answer the nice judge politely! Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! The thing you asked for just came in.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Ngh... And you couldn't be bothered to think of a less violent way to deliver it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What did Prosecutor Blackquill ask for?)</textEffects>   
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ I've been waiting for this.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh? And what is that?
</line><line>Blackquill:
............An updated autopsy report.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Why did it have to come now?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
During the recess, I ordered the body to be re-examined. Something started nagging at me during the course of the trial, you see. ............Here. 
</line><line>Judge:
I take it you'd like me to read it? Very well. "Cause of Death: Thought to be from 65-foot <textEffects>fall</textEffects>"!
</line><line><textEffects>Shipley's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>      
</line><line>Judge:
B-But this...! But this is decisive evidence that substantiates Mr. Wright's theory!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! <textEffects>(It's something... GOOD for a change?!)</textEffects>      
</line><line>Judge:
If the manner of death was falling into an empty pool, the orca can't be responsible. It seems Orla's complete innocence has been proven. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph............ I suppose I can't deny that. 
</line><line>Athena:
This is fantastic! You did it, Mr. Wright! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't even trying to refute it! Orla is saved!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... <textEffects>(Is it really safe to celebrate...?)</textEffects>      
</line><line>Judge:
It would appear more investigation into this case is necessary. But first allow me to render my verdict. The court finds the defendant Ora Shipley...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>
Buckler:
You did it! Thank you so much, Phoenix! Thank you, Athena! Orla and Marlon thank you, too!
</line><line>Rimes:
Congrats, Sasha!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
</line><line>Rimes:
Time to celebrate! Go on! Eat up!
</line><line>Orla:
Fwee, fwee, fweet!
</line><line>Athena:
Hee hee! Glad to see everybody so happy! And I'm absolutely thrilled about the verdict!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............ ...Thank you, Wright-dono. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?! For what?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... The drained pool... Thanks to you, the truth is finally clear. Fool Bright............ Arrest this woman. 
</line><line>Fulbright:
Certainly! Right away, Prosecutor Blackquill! Sasha Buckler, you are hereby under arrest for the murder of Jack Shipley!
</line><line>Buckler:
WHAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about?! What reason could you possibly have?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Come now. You must have had some idea in the back of your dull, little mind. The true culprit <textEffects>manipulated</textEffects> the orca in order to have false charges brought upon her. ...And who is the only one with the ability to accomplish that? It can only be the orca's trainer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I'm sure there's some other explanation!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420131502" class="image"><img alt="Silence Official" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="173" data-image-name="Silence Official.png" data-image-key="Silence_Official.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d6/Silence_Official.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420131502" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
I don't need any of your baseless counterarguments... Have you forgotten? In order to enter the orca pool room, a <textEffects>security card</textEffects> is necessary. A security card that only the victim and Sasha Buckler possessed! Ms. Buckler is the only one who could have caused the victim to fall to his death!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Athena:
No! I don't believe it! Ms. Buckler was so upset by Mr. Shipley's death! She couldn't have done it!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Fool Bright. 
</line><line>Fulbright:
We asked the security company yesterday to check their security card logs. Their report just came in during the recess. The night before the incident, Sasha Buckler used her card to enter the orca pool room. After that, not a single person entered the pool room! Not until the incident was discovered, when Ms. Buckler and the guard ran in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But no one would commit murder where their card usage was being recorded!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Apparently, the aquarium employees don't know that their card usage is tracked. What's more, Ms. Buckler was seen arguing with the victim before the incident. So, Ms. Trainer, what were you arguing about?
</line><line>Buckler:
It was... a private matter... But it wasn't anything I would kill him over! That's ridiculous!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Ms. Buckler is the only one who entered the room, and she knows how to command Orla. Besides, I thought her suspicious from the very beginning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You suspected Ms. Buckler from the start?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The orca did tricks because someone commanded her to do so. Possibly someone with a heart so black as to make her own partner the murder weapon! The possibility the orca killed the victim... The possibility a human manipulated the orca... I looked into both.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So he suspected both Sasha and Orla all along...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph... My gratitude to you. After all... ...you were the one who drew out that information about the lifesaver trick. The orca you saved was an unwitting <textEffects>victim</textEffects>. A victim made to look like <textEffects>the weapon that killed Jack Shipley</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ungg... N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Fulbright:
All right, come along, then. Let's have a good, long talk...
</line><line>Buckler:
Wait! I didn't kill the captain! And I would never try to frame Orla! Why would I hurt the ones I love like that?! 
</line><line>Athena:
Sasha...!
</line><line>Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe me! I--
</line><line>Athena:
Sasha didn't kill him! I believe that with all my heart! There's gotta be something we can do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I feel the same way... Could I have done something differently? But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine things turning out like this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It would appear that this case has taken on an entirely new suspect. But this trial is only concerned with a ruling on the defendant, Ora Shipley. So I'm afraid this concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!
