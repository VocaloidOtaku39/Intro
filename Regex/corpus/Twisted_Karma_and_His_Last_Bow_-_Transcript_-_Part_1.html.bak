<i>Anime cutscene</i>
Pipe in hand, Sholmes looked down at the thick, rolling fog outside our window. 'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that "other side" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!'

<hr />
<center>Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel.</center>

Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! .........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
The truth about Kazuma-sama's father...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
Do you suppose my father knew?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That <textEffects>he was actually</textEffects> the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? <textEffects>(I knew that's what she was thinking about.)</textEffects> There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, that's true...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well?
</line><line>Susato:
That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up <span style="color:#E16935">here in London</textEffects> with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>Ah, there she is!</center>
<line>
Susato:
Oh... Father!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Hello, Susato! How are you?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mikotoba:
Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure.
</line><line>???:
We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It, it has?
</line><line>???:
I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! <textEffects>(Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it.
</line><line>???:
Yes...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(A, a firm tap? What?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Y... Your... ...Your Excellency!
</line><line>Susato:
Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time.
</line><line>Jigoku:
Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jigoku:
So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro?
</line><line>Jigoku:
What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's <span style="color:#E16935">the third</textEffects> visiting scholar.)</span>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you?
</line><line>Jigoku:
Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Ministerial status?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal <textEffects>insistence</textEffects> that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour.
</line><line>Jigoku:
Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh. Well, thank you very much. <textEffects>(He's really every bit as important as he looks.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, you did?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy.
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Could you tell us any more about it?

<line><i>After clearing all Converse options:</i>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, if you'll excuse us now...
</line><line>Jigoku:
Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long.
</line><line>Susato:
I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Susato-san's gone off at a run!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mikotoba:
I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I heard.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Susato:
It was a rather turbulent time at home...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mikotoba:
...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain.
</line><line>Jigoku:
I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I...completely understand, Professor.
</line><line>Mikotoba:
......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have <textEffects>a favour</textEffects> to ask you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you?
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, the thing is, I-
</line><line>Susato:
I'm so sorry that took so long!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato!
</line><line>Susato:
Now then...allow us to take your bags!
</line><line>Porter:
Allow me to take your bags!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
One moment, if you please, porter.
</line><line>Porter:
Of...of course, sir!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe?
</line><line>Porter:
Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir!
</line><line>Mikotoba:
Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense.
</line><line>Porter:
......... Ah! Yes, yes of course!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Susato:
...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. <textEffects>(But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, let's go. <textEffects>(I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...)</textEffects>

Van Zieks:
Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard.
</line><line>Stronghart:
I see. Excellent work. Thank you.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...You're welcome, My Lord.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stronghart:
My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure.
</line><line>Susato:
From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here!
</line><line>Stronghart:
Now then, Mr Naruhodo...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here!
</line><line>Stronghart:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(Ugh... Kill me now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stronghart:
Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature!
</line><line>Stronghart:
If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stronghart:
As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited.
</line><line>Stronghart:
I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I will attend at once.
</line><line>Susato:
He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I know. But I haven't done anything...have I?
</line><line>Stronghart:
These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service?
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! <textEffects>(Of course...)</textEffects> I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um...
</line><line>Stronghart:
Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stronghart:
Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
O-Oh... <textEffects>(Missing...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
What's become of Kazuma-sama now...?

Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon...

Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea!

Whatever is going on here today?

In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today.

As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure!

Excellent! And what did you make of it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, so you noted that?
</line><line>Susato:
Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Drebber:
Lowgate Cemetery as at <textEffects>the rear</textEffects> of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by <textEffects>the ghosts of condemned convicts</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Susato:
Barclay Prison is where <textEffects>that notorious man</textEffects> was incarcerated!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The Professor...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And now a warder from the prison has <textEffects>mysteriously disappeared</textEffects>, it would seem.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's all very peculiar...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...aren't you going to go yourself?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with <textEffects>this hair</textEffects>!

Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe.
