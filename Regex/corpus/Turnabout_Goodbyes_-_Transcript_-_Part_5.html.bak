We have our own questions for him! Let's come back later.

Gumshoe? He won't be coming back today.

Oh... really?
</line><line>Police:
He said there was some guy he had to arrest by tomorrow.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The boat shop caretaker...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Police:
He shouted something about "catching him if it's the last thing I do, pal!"

Nick! We have to save Mr. Edgeworth if it's the last thing we do, okay?

Right. <textEffects>(It very well may be...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is!

I'd settle for who. <textEffects>(I guess I can clean out some of this evidence I no longer need... ...)</textEffects> Okay, let's go!

</line><line>Phoenix:
You look grim as always.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph.
</line><line>Maya:
Um, Mr. Edgeworth? I heard the story about the class trial...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Class trial? What do you mean?
</line><line>Maya:
You... don't remember?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, I don't.
</line><line>Maya:
Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway.
</line><line>Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Ridiculous!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gee... thanks.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a fault, even.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Perhaps.

Hey, pal! Long time no see!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh! Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Close one today, eh! I got so worked up, I snapped my tie in half!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... Sorry about that.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No prob, pal! Thanks to you, we now know who really did it!
</line><line>Maya:
You mean, the boat shop caretaker?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Look, I'll make you a promise. I'll have that scoundrel in my custody by trial time tomorrow! Come what may! It's my duty to you as a police officer! Now, I'm off to catch me a criminal!
</line><line>Maya:
... Detective Gumshoe sure is... active today.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh, one other thing!
</line><line>Maya:
Eek!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No one can go into the woods today.
</line><line>Maya:
The woods?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Where Lotta was camping?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The woods are off-limits to camping, and apparently the park ranger found out. He got pretty mad. No one can go in for a while.
</line><line>Maya:
I guess Lotta's in a 'lotta' trouble...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Anyway, I'll be seeing you tomorrow!

Looks like the hotdog stand is closed, too.

</line><line>Maya:
Mr. Grossberg! This is no time for idle reminiscing! Mr. Edgeworth's trial ends tomorrow!
</line><line>Grossberg:
Er... that is true, yes. But, from what I saw of today's trial, Edgeworth should be fine, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... I'm not so sure about that.
</line><line>Grossberg:
Ho ho! What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... I'm not sure.
</line><line>Grossberg:
Hmm... If you find anything out, come by my office at once. I may be able to offer you some assistance.

Thanks... <textEffects>(Bye...)</textEffects>

What do you think Mr. Grossberg was doing here anyway?

M-Mr. Grossberg!
</line><line>Grossberg:
Ah, hello there. What's wrong? You look troubled.
</line><line>Maya:
No kidding! I can't believe you're not!
</line><line>Grossberg:
M-my my my... Just calm down and tell me what's happened, hmm?
</line><line>Maya:
It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Grossberg:
I see... So, Edgeworth dreamt he shot his own father?
</line><line>Maya:
It's o-only a dream! Only a dream!
</line><line>Grossberg:
... I wonder...
</line><line>Maya:
W-what...?
</line><line>Grossberg:
If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm?
</line><line>Maya:
W-well...
</line><line>Grossberg:
Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ...
</line><line>Maya:
N... No! I don't believe it!
</line><line>Grossberg:
Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought <textEffects>revenge</textEffects> on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close.

Hmm... could it be Manfred von Karma?

von Karma? Why would he have something to do with this?

Um, well, I'm not sure...
</line><line>Grossberg:
... Hmm? von Karma... von Karma... W-wait! You're right, my boy! This is <textEffects>von Karma's handwriting</textEffects>, I'm sure of it! I used to see it all the time on court reports...
</line><line>Maya:
Whaaaaaat!? But... but that means...! Th-the one who told Mr. Yogi to kill was...
</line><line>Grossberg:
Correct. <textEffects>Manfred von Karma</textEffects>, himself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What does this mean, then? Why would von Karma want to frame Edgeworth...?

What do we do, Nick? von Karma is going to bring up <textEffects>DL-6</textEffects>, you can bet on it! What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads guilty to DL-6!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I won't let him!
</line><line>Grossberg:
Erm, yes, Mr. Wright... I hate to say this... But even accidental murder is murder, you know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know that! ... I... I just believe in Edgeworth's innocence! I can't believe he'd kill someone!
</line><line>Maya:
B-but, Nick! Mr. Edgeworth admits it himself! His father must have lied to protect him, beyond the grave...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't care! I know he's not guilty!
</line><line>Grossberg:
... Mr. Wright... If you say so, I suppose I could go check again. The police files might hold something of interest.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... thank you!
</line><line>Grossberg:
I can't promise anything. In fact, I think the chances of finding something are slim.

Ah, it's you. I don't think Gumshoe'll be coming back today. He's staying out late looking for someone.
</line><line>Maya:
Sounds like Detective Gumshoe is pounding the pavement for real! Um, we were wondering if we could check out the Records Room again...
</line><line>Police:
Well, now, I can't have just anyone wandering around in there. But... I guess Mr. von Karma is in there now, anyway. You can go in as long as he's there.

von Karma...?

Yes. He just arrived actually.

Defense team...?  Ahem. I beg your pardon, you see, I rarely remember defense attorneys. They are like bugs to me. Needless things, to be crushed.

Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.
</line><line>Karma:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder.
</line><line>Karma:
... Yanni Yogi... How many years has it been since I've heard him called by that name. He's a fool. I told him to burn it after he read it.
</line><line>Maya:
...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter!
</line><line>Karma:
Yes, my dear defense attorney. Thank you for taking the trouble to bring it to me. You've saved me from a lot of needless hassle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! What is that thing!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A <textEffects>stun gun</textEffects>. For self defense... usually.
</line><line>Karma:
Indeed. 600,000 volts will course through your body like a dog touching an electric fence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Six hundred thous...!?
</line><line>Karma:
Oh, don't worry. People don't die from it, usually. Now, give me the letter.

<textEffects>(No!!!)</textEffects>

Nooooooooooo!
