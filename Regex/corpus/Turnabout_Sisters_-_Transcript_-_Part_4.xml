<line>Maya:
Well... I guess this is it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.
</line><line>Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.
</line><line>Phoenix:
?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?)</textEffects> So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.
</line><line>Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... court will be opening for session soon.
</line><line>Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll be defending myself.
</line><line>Maya:
Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1</textEffects></captions>
<line>Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.
</line><line>Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.
</line><line>White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Er... your name?
</line><line>White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Name!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(These two are great together...)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?
</line><line>White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?
</line><line>White:
Correct.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?
</line><line>White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!

<line>White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

<line>White:
<textEffects>I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>White:
<textEffects>Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!</textEffects>

<line>White:
<textEffects>Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.</textEffects>

<textEffects>Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!
</line><line>White:
What is this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!
</line><line>White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running <textEffects>directly away from the door!</textEffects> She would have been running into a <textEffects>dead end!</textEffects> Don't you find that odd?
</line><line>White:
! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.
</line><line>Maya:
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.
</line><line>Phoenix:
True. <textEffects>(Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, what do you mean, he was not "viewing the crime from the hotel"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In the law offices of Fey &amp; Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! <textEffects>(Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the "left."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?
</line><line>White:
R-r-rapscallion!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...
</line><line>White:
... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What now!? He's... laughing!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)</textEffects>

<line>White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
That is what Miss May saw.
You see? You hit her twice!
Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.

I think we've got him right where we want him! He slipped! Let him laugh for now. I'll soon wipe that smile off his face!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. White! The victim died from a "single" blow!
</line><line>White:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you have to say to that?
</line><line>White:
Er... Erp!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!)</textEffects> Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were "abso-posi-lutely perfect"?
</line><line>White:
Mmph. I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...

The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!
</line><line>(Yeah! We want justice...!)
</line><line>(Don't let him get away!)
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. If the witness would care to revise his testimony...

Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.
Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!

Umm... and then...
She turned, and ran for the door!
Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm. "Thwap" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.
</line><line>White:
Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...

</line><line>White:
Huh? W-what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're saying you saw the glass light stand?
</line><line>White:
Y-yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then change your testimony to reflect that!

S-sorry. My bad...

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Look at this!
</line><line>Judge:
These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Correct, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?
</line><line>White:
Er... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!
</line><line>White:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what!? <textEffects>(Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. White...
</line><line>White:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?
</line><line>White:
W... what?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The w-wiretap!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Distinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I really don't like the way this is headed...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.
</line><line>Judge:
What does that have to do...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! You wouldn't!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?
</line><line>White:
...&#160;! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Give me a break!
</line><line>White:
Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Now I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: At the very moment of the murder! Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!
</line><line>Judge:
I see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! He went to place the wiretap! He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretap!
</line><line>White:
Ahem. Leave it to me!
</line><line>Phoenix:

<line>White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
I had entered the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.
That is when I saw this glass light stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?
</line><line>White:
Correct! That is right.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)</textEffects>

Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.

So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?
</line><line>Mia:
That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.

Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote "Maya" on...?
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... so what do I do with it?
</line><line>Mia:
Look at the front of the receipt!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The... front? <textEffects>(It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. "$1,000.00"... wow, big spender! "Item"... "glass light stand"...! "Date of purchase"... "September 4"...)</textEffects> ...! September 4!
</line><line>Mia:
That's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoa!
</line><line>Mia:
Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?
</line>
<hr />
<line>White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!
</line><line>Mia:
There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right!

<line>Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright. Is the defendant... rather, are you alright, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, let's start where we left off.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his "last chance."
</line><line>Judge:
Very well! You may begin your cross-examination.

<line>White:
<textEffects>I had entered the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>White:
<textEffects>Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>White:
<textEffects>That is when I saw this glass light stand.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now I've just got to show him the proof Mia gave me!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Look closely at this. See the word "Maya" written in blood...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Bwah hah! You're grasping!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the other side of the receipt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-the other side?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. Would you tell the court what is written on the other side of that receipt?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well! A "glass light stand"! And the date of purchase... Why, that's the day before the murder!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You see! Mr. White. When you allegedly entered Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices at the beginning of September... The stand could not have been there!
</line><line>White:
Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. White? Can't get out of this one, can you?
</line><line>White:
No... It's impossachievable...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh... he's losing it.)</textEffects> ... Well, Your Honor. I understand there must be quite a bit of PRESSURE on you. But I think you'll agree you can't judge me "guilty" under these circumstances.
</line><line>Judge:
! ...... Very well. Then, that is all for the trial of...

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Eh? <textEffects>(What! No way he can worm his way out of this one! Oh wait... I forgot. It's Edgeworth.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is a certain thread of logic to the defendant's claims. However! There is no concrete proof that Phoenix Wright is innocent!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ergo! I would like to request one more day before Phoenix Wright is granted his freedom. I need time to make one more inquiry into this matter.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Another inquiry...!? This isn't going to be another one of those "updated autopsy reports"! This guy just makes up evidence as he pleases! This is bad...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
The completion of the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright will be postponed until tomorrow.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No! There's no telling what will happen if I can't end this now! Edgeworth is sure to come up with--or just make up--something! And after Mia showed up to help me and all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
Mr. Your Honor! May I go home?
</line><line>Judge:
Of course. Thank you for your time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gah!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
The witness will stay!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(M-Mia...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix! Read this note out loud.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia? What's this...?
</line><line><textEffects>Memo received from Mia.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. If I may...?
</line><line>Judge:
You're quite persistent today, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You bet I am! My life is riding on this one!)</textEffects> I have something I would like to read to the court!
</line>


<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The memo Mia had given me was a list of names. Many of them sounded strangely familiar. People in finance, famous celebrities... That's when it happened.
</line>
<hr />
<line>White:
S-s-stop! Desist! Halt! P-please, stop! Make him stop! How... how did you get that list!?
</line><line>Mia:
Mr. White. Admit your guilt, right here, right now. Or else this list will be released to the press!
</line><line>White:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">!!!</captions>
<line>White:
... I... I confess. I confess. I... I did it. I hit her. I hit Miss Mia with "The Thinker"! ...
</line><line>Mia:
Case closed, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I see no reason to continue this trial. Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
You've done it again! That was quite a spirited defense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I guess you could say that. <textEffects>(If only you knew how "spirit"-ed it was!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Well! This court finds the defense... Ahem! Rather, the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...

<line>Mia:
Well, I never thought I'd be saying this again... But, congratulations! You're lucky I was born a Fey!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm lucky I had both you and Maya on my side.
</line><line>Mia:
I'm glad you made it. ... Thank you, Phoenix. You risked a lot to help me... and Maya. I won't forget it as long as I live!

</line><line>Mia:
... My time here's running out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Mia:
Maya's powers are still weak. I can't stay here that long.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what!? No! There's still so much to say!
</line><line>Mia:
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll meet again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ch-Chief!
</line><line>Mia:
Hee hee. I'm not the "Chief" anymore. Phoenix? Can you come to the office tonight... say, 9:00?

I'll see you later.

You came!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia...
</line><line>???:
I was kinda worried you might not.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Of course I came...
</line><line>???:
Well then! I'm pretty hungry. How about a burger?
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mia...?

Mia!

What, did I look like my sister?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Look like... you WERE her!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm! I might be able to use that. "Oh, Phoenix! Go to the store and buy me lunch, would you?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhm, Maya... Why are you here?
</line><line>Maya:
Because of this! See? Mia wrote me a letter. "Take care of Phoenix for me."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take care of... huh?
</line><line>Maya:
She means the office! This office! Someone has to help with the new Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, right? And who better but me! Maya Fey, reporting for duty! Wait, no, on second thought, let's make this casual! Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready to get down to business! You... don't mind me calling you "Nick," do you? It's a great name! Mia said that's what your friend Larry calls you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Nick"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
You know what this means? We're partners!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You know, when I think about it... It is Maya's fault I'm here now. But... If it wasn't for her I'd probably be in jail! "Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices." It's got a good ring to it. Yeah! Thanks, Maya!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mia:
(Good luck, Phoenix. I'll always be here... watching.)
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Do... what?
</line><line>Maya:
Burgers, dummy! Burgers! There's a great burger joint just down the street. C'mon! Time's a wasting!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-okay! Wait up!
