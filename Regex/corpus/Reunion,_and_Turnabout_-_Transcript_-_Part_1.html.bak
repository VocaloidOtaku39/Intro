<line>That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
I finally get to see you again, and...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not your fault. You didn't do it.
</line><line>Maya:
No, I... I did it... I killed that person.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But that wasn't you.
</line><line>Maya:
It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)</textEffects>

<line>???:
What depressing rain...Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, I guess...
</line><line>???:
But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. "I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it's the weather...
</line><line>???:
But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?
</line><line>???:
... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grey:
I'm here today because of this incident.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?
</line><line>Grey:
It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.
</line><line>Grey:
The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Grey:
Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?
</line><line>Grey:
That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.)</textEffects> So... what would you like me to do about it...?
</line><line>Grey:
I want you to help me prove I'm innocent.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?
</line><line>Grey:
No, this is something only you can do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Grey:
Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grey:
I heard you were working under her for a little while.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked <textEffects>UNDER her</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Grey:
Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.
</line><line>Grey:
Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!
</line><line>Grey:
She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Grey:
I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is Maya... really that famous...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grey:
And I've already set up an appointment.
</line><line>Phoenix:
For what?
</line><line>Grey:
What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Oh. <textEffects>(Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's what she told me...I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Grey:
Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A condition...?
</line><line>Grey:
The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me...?
</line><line>Grey:
And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Why, hello there.
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... What an odd little girl.
</line><line>???:
Hey! Wait up, Pearly!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Niiiiiiiick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.
</line><line>Maya:
No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.
</line><line>Maya:
Heh, heh...

</line><line>Maya:
Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, yeah...
</line><line>Maya:
I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Alright. Good luck, Maya.
</line><line>Maya:
Thanks!
</line><line>Phoenix:

<line>Grey:
Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?
</line><line>Grey:
No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. "It will rain cats and dogs today!" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grey:
...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grey:
I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.

<textEffects>(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Good sir! Who might you be...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...
</line><line>???:
Oh... You must be that good sir...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Good sir"...? Is she talking about me?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Is that so? <textEffects>("Mystic" Maya...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-Nice to meet you.
</line><line>Morgan:
Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Morgan:
Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for "How Not to Make a First Impression"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Morgan:
The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.

She is an adorable, angelic young girl.

Oh, that odd...
</line><line>Morgan:
She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...
</line><line>Morgan:
A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.

With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?

Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?

Yup, right here.

That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.
