<line>Now! The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our "Hero of Heroes"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope lady luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix...
</line><line>IS ME!!
</line><line>Whoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!

<line>Maya:
Alright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.
</line><line>Powers:
Ah, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.
</line><line>Pearl:
U-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?
</line><line>Maya:
Yup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? "The Nickel Samurai"!
</line><line>Pearl:
No. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
</line><line>Maya:
OK, that's it! From now on, it's "The Nickel Samurai"! All the kids watch it!
</line><line>Pearl:
Do you like "The Nickel Samurai" too, Mr. Nick?
</line><line>Maya:
Nah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. But I do like "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.
</line><line>Maya:
Aw, give it a rest, Pearly!
</line><line>Powers:
Looks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.
</line><line>Maya:
Aaaaah... It's like a dream!
</line><line>Powers:
Too bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?
</line><line>Pearl:
Different? What do you mean?
</line><line>Maya:
Um, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.
</line><line>Powers:
Hey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...)</textEffects> Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.
</line><line>Powers:
A-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.
</line><line>Powers:
And then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?
</line><line>Powers:
Uh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai <textEffects>confessing</textEffects> something.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Confessing...? Sounds pretty serious.
</line><line>Maya:
Argh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Yeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)</textEffects>

Wow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...

</line><line>Powers:
Sounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.
</line><line>Maya:
Alright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? "Nickel Samurai Smelting!"
</line><line>Powers:
Actually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.
</line><line>Maya:
You mean the "big confession" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?
</line><line>Powers:
Uh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.
</line><line>Maya:
Bah.
</line><line>Powers:
S-Sorry.
</line><line>Powers:
Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, of course!
</line><line>Powers:
If that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.

</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.
</line><line>Pearl:
It looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!

OK! For great justice!

<line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
They're using a compact stage, I see.
</line><line>Maya:
Ooh... I'm all ready to use my special "Samurai Power".
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)</textEffects>
</line><line>PA Notice:
<textEffects>Your attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
WHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!
</line><line>PA Notice:
<textEffects>We are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the <span style="color:#E16935">police</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Pearl:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Police? Did they just say the police?
</line><line>Powers:
D-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, wait, I'll come with you...
</line><line>???:
Freeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!
</line><line>Maya:
Th-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...
</line><line>???:
Honestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, "Beware, Bridge Out!" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the "in" part of the bridge since the "out" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!
</line><line>Powers:
This non-stop chatter...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Oldbag:
What is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?
</line><line>Powers:
Y-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...
</line><line>Oldbag:
You didn't get nominated last year either, did you? Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.
</line><line>Powers:
Ah, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...
</line><line>Oldbag:
I love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the "big brother" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face. What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... What are you doing here?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Look at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!
</line><line>Maya:
But that outfit...
</line><line>Oldbag:
Annoying, noisy brats get the blaster!

...Hey, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...
</line><line>Maya:
Let's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No way. The police told us not go anywhere, remember?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!
</line><line>Pearl:
Huh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
So listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.
</line><line>Maya:
Yay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!
</line><line>Pearl:
That's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.

Goody! I get to come! I get to come!

Are you looking for the "something" that the old lady was talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Doesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.
</line><line>Maya:
Alright! Then, let's try...
</line><line>Bellboy:
Excuse me.
</line><line>Maya:
Ack!
</line><line>Bellboy:
Are you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?
</line><line>Maya:
Um, yeah... That's me.
</line><line>Bellboy:
You have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.
</line><line>Maya:
A call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...
</line><line>Pearl:
What's wrong, Mystic Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?
</line><line>Pearl:
OK.
</line><line>Bellboy:
Right this way, Ms. Fey.
</line><line>Pearl:
Let's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, OK.
</line><line>Pearl:
This is a little exciting... And a little scary...

Hey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.
</line><line>Powers:
Wh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Powers:
Y-You're joking, right!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.
</line><line>Powers:
Ooogh... Not again... I feel sick.
</line><line>Pearl:
"Again"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.

I still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...

<textEffects>Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?</textEffects>

<textEffects>You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...</textEffects>

<textEffects>Heeelp! Niiiiick!</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
M-Mystic Maya!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya...?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>So, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?)</textEffects> Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?

<textEffects>Come now. Don't fall apart on me yet.</textEffects>

<textEffects>(Th-This... No! This can't be!)</textEffects>

<textEffects>Now that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable "<span style="color:#E16935">item</textEffects>" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
..."Kidnapping for ransom"...

<textEffects>Yes, that's it. This is a <span style="color:#E16935">kidnapping</textEffects>.</span>

<textEffects>Very good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.</textEffects>

Hurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya --
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Money is not what I seek.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>What I want is a certain <span style="color:#E16935">verdict</textEffects>. I would like a <textEffects>complete acquittal</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Complete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>I am not the person you will be representing.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
What...?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Juan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Matt Engarde? But why?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>He did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-However!? However what!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>However, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not. However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious "<span style="color:#E16935">item</textEffects>" is with me, in my possession.</span>
</line><line>Maya:
<textEffects>Mmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have <span style="color:#E16935">one chance</textEffects>. One chance, Mr. Wright.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Yes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aagh!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Oh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, "And don't even think about callin' the cops!" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?

N-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not your fault, Pearls.
</line><line>Pearl:
But it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Powers:
Mr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's <i>[sic]</i> going on...!

<line>Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Shhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wait, the deal is "complete acquittal" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously <textEffects>the killer</textEffects>, pal! No doubt about it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's too much evidence? Is that possible? <textEffects>(Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being "<span style="color:#E16935">set-up</textEffects>"...?)</span>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Anyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...A-Alright... <textEffects>(Isn't there another way...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
We've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.

You're right...

Yes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.

Calm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a <textEffects>business transaction</textEffects>.

A... A business transaction?

I am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.

</line><line>Pearl:
Th-That's you, Ms. von Karma! You're the one doing the following!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pearls...
</line><line>Pearl:
You're always following after that Mr. Detective with the little beard!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Me? Following after Scruffy...? Don't make me laugh. I'll show you something interesting... little girl.
</line><line><textEffects>...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Wh-What is that?
</line><line>von Karma:
An electromagnetic receiver. I planted a tracking device on that detective. And with this, I know that fool's every move.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that noise we heard was this receiver... I feel really sorry for poor Detective Gumshoe now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Now then... Let's stop wasting time. Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>Andrews:
Y-Yes...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?
</line><line>Andrews:
A-Alright... ...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What were those two talking about...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Ms. Andrews... She seems a little dazed, doesn't she?
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?
</line><line>Andrews:
... A silly third-rate tabloid article. If you even had half your wits about you, you wouldn't believe such rubbish.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story.
</line><line>Andrews:
Hmph. As to be expected in a world filled with crooks and liars.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Note to self: Stay on her good side.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
In any case, I despise interpersonal relationships like that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Didn't you get close to Mr. Corrida for this person's sake...?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Celeste Inpax, your mentor.
</line><line>Andrews:
Why do you know about Celeste!?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Inpax... She committed suicide, didn't she?
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But it looks like no one knows why. Right before her death, she was Juan Corrida's manager. So, I believe you got close to Mr. Corrida so you could find out more about her suicide.
</line><line>Andrews:
...Y-You have a great imagination. You may have a future yet as a slimy muckraker for a putrid third-rate tabloid!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Ms. Andrews...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None. It would be pointless for me to force myself into a relationship for nothing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that really true...? Was there really no mystery at all?)</textEffects> <textEffects>I don't believe you were completely at ease with the way her suicide was resolved!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
...Ms. Inpax's suicide note was never found, was it?
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like the police were under the suspicion that someone had hidden it. Like maybe the person who discovered her body, Mr. Corrida.
</line><line>Andrews:
J... Juan?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And, Ms. Andrews, I believe you thought the same thing! That is why you became intimate with Mr. Corrida!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Andrews:
I-I've sat by quietly and listened to your insulting ramblings long enough!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Andrews:
It's true that Celeste was my mentor, however, allow me to say this again: It had nothing to do with me! I didn't even know that her suicide note was never found! I'm a person who doesn't care about what goes on in the lives of others!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's the impression you like to give, however...)</textEffects> I don't think that's who you really are.
</line><line>Andrews:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have evidence that says otherwise. <textEffects>This is proof that Celeste Inpax was someone very special to you...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... You... You went through it too, didn't you?
</line><line>Andrews:
Went through what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A suicide.
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews, you look and act like a very strong woman who has it all together. You don't ask for anyone's help and you live by yourself.
</line><line>Andrews:
Y-Yes. I've been very independent ever since I can remember...
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, that is all just a lie. A façade.
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You've always searched out people on whom you can <textEffects>depend</textEffects> on.
</line><line>Andrews:
Th-That's...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were dependent on Ms. Inpax, weren't you? Which is why... When she passed away, you lost everything you had.
</line><line>Andrews:
S-Stop!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Andrews:
... When Celeste passed away so suddenly like that... I died a death of my own. But... No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about what had become of her note.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You must have heard about the police report... The one that said the police suspected Mr. Corrida of hiding Ms. Inpax's note... You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right?
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that's the case, then everything changes.
</line><line>Andrews:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What topic did we start this conversation on again?
</line><line>Andrews:
It was "why was the victim killed"...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. Somehow, Ms. Andrews... It seems that <textEffects>you</textEffects> have become the one most likely to want Mr. Corrida dead...
</line><line>Andrews:
<textEffects>M-Me</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Inpax was everything to you. ...And then she died. And you would do anything to find out why she killed herself. ...Even commit <textEffects>murder</textEffects>.
</line><line>Andrews:
Murder...!?

<line>Andrews:
It's true. I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth...
</line><line>Pearl:
Ms. Andrews...
</line><line>Andrews:
This one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... I'm sorry.
</line><line>Andrews:
You probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.
</line><line>Andrews:
After Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?
</line><line>Andrews:
... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.
</line><line>Andrews:
And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.
</line><line>Pearl:
...
</line><line>Andrews:
But as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.
</line><line>Andrews:
... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I understand.
</line><line>Andrews:
Oh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.
</line><line>Pearl:
Ms. Andrews...
</line><line>Andrews:
If... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! <textEffects>(Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the "always thinking" type... She never says anything carelessly, it seems...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
Thank you very much.
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Nick... Can I ask you something...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it?
</line><line>Pearl:
Ms. Andrews has been playing with that card in her hand since a little while back...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That card...? Yeah, I guess she has...)</textEffects> Ms. Andrews, what is that card you're holding...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Huh? O-Oh, this? I don't quite know. It just suddenly appeared in my handbag...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it? It looks like... A seashell?
</line><line>Andrews:
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? I honestly don't remember owning this card... I wonder where I picked it up from...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
Well, I must be off. I leave Mr. Engarde in your "capable" hands.
