      The Oblivion Crisis
      by Praxis Sarcorum, Imperial Historian
      A summary of the events stemming from <strong>the assassination of <span class="character">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span></strong>
      
      
      
      <p>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <strong>the <span class="character">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span> was
            assassinated</strong> and <strong>the <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span>
            was destroyed</strong>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
         down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong>The <span class="mythicdawn">assassins</span> first attacked the
            <span class="character">Emperor</span></strong> in the
         <u>White Gold Tower</u>. While the <span class="blades">Blades</span> held <span class="mythicdawn">them</span> back,
         <strong>the <span class="character">Emperor</span> made <span class="character">his</span> way down to the
            <u>dungeons</u></strong>, to a <u>secret escape
            route</u> built into <u>one of the prison cells</u>. For
         reasons known only to <span class="character">himself</span>, the <span class="character">Emperor</span>
         <strong>pardoned the fortunate <span class="character">prisoner</span></strong> in that <u>cell</u>. Some say the
         <span class="character">prisoner</span> reminded <span class="character">him</span> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <strong>moment of
            prophecy</strong>. Whatever the case, the <span class="character">prisoner</span> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
         <u>Empire</u> and <u>Tamriel</u> - surely a sign that
         the gods themselves were at work.</p>
      
      
      <p>The pursuing <strong><span class="mythicdawn">assassins</span> killed the
            <span class="blades">Blades</span> bodyguards</strong> in a relentless
         series of sneak attacks. Eventually <strong><span class="mythicdawn">they</span>
            struck down the <span class="character">Emperor</span>
            <span class="character">himself</span></strong>. Before <span class="character">he</span> fell, <strong><span class="character">Uriel Septim VII</span> gave the <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span> to
            the <span class="character">prisoner</span></strong>, who somehow
         <strong>made it out of the <u>Imperial sewers</u></strong> and
         into the light of day.</p>
      
      
      <p>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <span class="mythicdawn">daedric cultists</span> known as the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn</span>. (Those who still suspect the Dark Brotherhood should consider two facts: first, they would have only
         needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the Dark Brotherhood would never be so foolish as to
         <strong>effectively declare war on the Empire</strong> and thus ensure their
         complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic
            Dawn</span>.)</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>The <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span> next surfaced at <u>Weynon
            Priory</u> near <u>Chorrol</u>. <span class="character">Jauffre</span>, secret <i>Grandmaster of the
            <span class="blades">Blades</span></i> and head of the
         <u>priory</u>, <strong>took possession of the
            <span class="item">amulet</span></strong>. <strong>The <span class="character">messenger</span> was sent off to <u>Kvatch</u></strong> to find a lowly <span class="character">priest</span> named <span class="character">Martin</span>.
         Unbeknownst even to <span class="character">himself</span>, <span class="character">Martin</span> was the bastard son of <span class="character">Uriel Septim VII</span>, and the last heir to the Ruby
         Throne. <span class="character">He</span> alone could use the
         <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
         barrier between <u>Tamriel</u> and <u>Oblivion</u>, and save
         the world from the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn</span> plot.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong>The <span class="character">prisoner</span> arrived at <u>Kvatch</u></strong> to find <u>it</u> overrun by <span class="daedra">daedra</span> that had poured in
         from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
         the
         Oblivion Crisis. How <strong>the <span class="character">prisoner</span> closed
            the gate</strong> is not recorded. Once closed, <span class="character">Martin</span> and the surviving <u>Kvatch</u>
         guardsmen drove back the <span class="daedra">daedra</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now known as the <i>Hero of <u>Kvatch</u></i>, <strong>the <span class="character">prisoner</span> and <span class="character">Martin</span>
            returned to <u>Weynon Priory</u></strong>, only to find the
         <u>priory</u> sacked and the <span class="item">Amulet</span> taken.
         <span class="character">Jauffre</span> survived the attack, however, and
         <strong>the <span class="character">three of them</span>
            made their way to <u>Cloud Ruler Temple</u></strong>, bastion of
         the <span class="blades">Blades</span>. This secret <u>fortress</u> in
         the <u>mountains</u> outside <u>Bruma</u> is
         where <span class="character">Martin</span> was held safe while
         <strong>the <i>Hero of <u>Kvatch</u></i> searched for the lost
            <span class="item">Amulet</span></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic
            Dawn</span> was behind the <strong>assassination and theft of the
            <span class="item">Amulet</span></strong>, <strong>the <i>Hero of <u>Kvatch</u></i> was sent to locate
            the <span class="mythicdawn">cult</span></strong>. With the help of
         <span class="character">Baurus</span>, a <span class="blades">Blade</span> in the
         service of the <span class="character">Emperor</span>, <span class="character">they</span> somehow <strong>used the
            <span class="item">Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</span></strong>,
         esoteric works by the madman <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span>,
         to direct <span class="character">them</span> to the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn</span>'s secret <u>lair</u>. Scholars
         familiar with the <span class="item">Commentaries</span> claim the location is not directly
         mentioned in <span class="item">them</span>. How <span class="character">they</span> did this remains a mystery.</p>
      
      
      <p>No official records exist of how <strong>the <i>Hero of
               <u>Kvatch</u></i> penetrated the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn</span>'s <u>lair</u></strong>
         near <u>Lake Arrius</u>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <span class="character">Hero</span> used <strong>trickery and disguise</strong>, but
         that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span> was behind the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn</span>, and that the <span class="mythicdawn">group</span> worshiped the daedric prince <span class="character">Mehrunes Dagon</span>. <span class="character">Mankar
            Camoran</span> believed <span class="character">himself</span> to
         be a direct descendant of the <span class="character">Camoran Usurper</span>, the infamous
         pretender to the throne of <u>Valenwood</u>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Somehow <strong>the <span class="character">Hero</span> escaped with the
            <span class="item">Mysterium Xarxes itself</span></strong>, the holy book of
         the <span class="mythicdawn">Mythic Dawn cult</span>. <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span> fled to <u>Oblivion</u> with the
         <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span>. With some effort and great risk to
         <span class="character">his</span> sanity, <strong><span class="character">Martin</span> deciphered the Mysterium
            Xarxes</strong> and intended to use <span class="item">it</span> to open a gateway
         to <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span> in order to recover the
         <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Before <span class="character">Martin</span> could perform the ritual
         to open the gateway, <strong><span class="character">Mehrunes
               Dagon</span> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <u>Bruma</u></strong>. <strong>The <i>Hero of
               <u>Kvatch</u></i> saved the <u>city</u> and <span class="character">Martin</span>
            by entering the gate and closing it</strong> before a <span class="daedra">daedric siege engine</span> could destroy <u>Bruma</u>
         and <u>Cloud Ruler Temple</u>. Many songs and stories have been told of
         this battle and I will not retell them here. The <i>Hero of <u>Kvatch</u></i> was now also known as the <i>Savior of <u>Bruma</u></i>.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the <u>city</u> and <u>Cloud Ruler
            Temple</u> safe, <strong><span class="character">Martin</span>
            opened the portal to <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span>'s
            "<u>Paradise</u>"</strong>. The details of what transpired in
         this <u>place</u> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
         <strong>the <i>Savior of <u>Bruma</u></i> travelled to this <u>Paradise</u>,
            killed <span class="character">Mankar Camoran</span>, and returned with
            the <span class="item">Amulet of Kings</span></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the <span class="item">Amulet</span> in hand, <strong><span class="character">Martin Septim</span> presented <span class="character">himself</span> to the Elder
            Council to be crowned <i>Emperor of all
               <u>Tamriel</u></i></strong>. Once crowned <span class="character">he</span> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
         <u>Tamriel</u> from <u>Oblivion</u>. In a last-ditch
         attempt to stop <span class="character">him</span>, <strong><span class="character">Mehrunes Dagon</span> launched an assault on the
            <u>Imperial City</u>, opening several Oblivion Gates
            within the <u>capital</u> itself</strong>. Uncrowned,
         <span class="character">Martin</span> joined the battle in the <u>city streets</u>.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong><span class="character">Mehrunes Dagon himself</span>
            left <u>Oblivion</u> and entered
            <u>Tamriel</u></strong>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
         Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
         it was
         too late to relighting the Fires. <span class="character">Martin
            Septim</span> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <strong><span class="character">he</span> shattered the <span class="item">Amulet of
               Kings</span> to become the <span class="character">avatar of the god
               Akatosh</span> and do battle with <span class="character">Mehrunes
               Dagon</span></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
         <strong><span class="character">Mehrunes Dagon</span> was
            defeated and sent back to <u>Oblivion</u></strong>.
         <strong>The <span class="character">avatar of Akatosh</span> was
            turned to stone</strong> and can be seen to this day in the <u>Temple of
            the One</u> in the <u>Imperial City</u>. With the
         <span class="item">Amulet</span> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
         Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <u>Oblivion</u> is sealed
         forever.</p>
