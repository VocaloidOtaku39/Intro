Yeah, we just want your money, that's all.

And you'll give it to us, won't you?

<textEffects>(Wh-what... What is this place? The room is lit but it's still somehow dark. And the atmosphere feels...heavy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! What are we doing in a place like this...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-how should I know?! We're just a couple of bakers...but I don't think they brought us here to make bread... <textEffects>(Yikes... Is it me or is that guard staring daggers at us right now?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...Mr Wright! Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! Espella! What exactly's going on?
</line><line>Espella:
I'm sorry... I was the one who sent for you both...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You...sent for us?
</line><line>Espella:
I...I'm being put on trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait, what?! What happened?!
</line><line>Espella:
I don't know! I just don't understand what's going on... I-I didn't do anything wrong! I couldn't possibly...murder anyone...
</line><line>Maya:
M-murder?
</line><line>Espella:
I beg you, Mr Wright! Please, I need your help... Just one more time...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? You need MY help? What could I possibly do?! Espella, I'm just a baker... The only thing I know about law is how not to get on the wrong side of it.
</line><line>Maya:
............... Wait, hold on a sec! Espella... What did you just say? You said you needed Nick's help "<textEffects>just one more time</textEffects>"...
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>One more time</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Espella:
I'm not quite sure myself... But when the knights came and took me, a vision suddenly appeared in my mind. It was Mr Wright... He was fighting for me...defending me! That brave blue figure... It was clear as day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was..."fighting" for you? N-no way... That's impossible! I mean, it's like I already said... I'm just a baker! I have a hard enough time rolling dough, let alone defending someone in court!
</line><line>Espella:
I thought the same thing too, at first. But...I don't think that's quite true. You...and Maya... At some time, somewhere... you helped me. ...You fought for me, as a <textEffects>defender</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A "defender"...)</textEffects> ............
</line><line>Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wish I knew, Maya... But hearing Espella mention a "<span style="color:#E16935">defender</textEffects>"... I can't help but feel something inside of me just burning at the mention of it!)</span>
</line><line>Knight:
Accused! Defender! It is time. Head forth, you two.
</line><line>Maya:
"Head forth"...? Um... Where are we going exactly?
</line><line>Knight:
To the courtroom in which today's trial will be taking place...the <textEffects>Chamber of Fire</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
Ch-Chamber...
</line><line>Phoenix:
of Fire...?
</line><line>Knight:
Make haste! If you are but a moment late, <textEffects>a guilty verdict</textEffects> will be delivered immediately!
</line><line>Maya:
Whaaaaaat?! N-no way...
</line><line>Espella:
Mr Wright... I...I'm truly sorry, Mr Wright! I know this is all so sudden... It's a lost cause, isn't it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
......... Well then, let's head inside, Espella.
</line><line>Espella:
Huh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This overwhelming pressure...it feels so familiar somehow. Almost like déjà vu.
</line><line>Espella:
M-Mr Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's go, Maya. Maybe we'll get a better idea once the trial gets under way.
</line><line>Maya:
......... Aaaaall right! Let's do it to it, Nick!
</line>

Phoenix:
What is this heat? It's like an oven in here.
</line><line>Judge:
I will now pronounce the verdict. This court finds the accused... guilty of being a witch!
</line><line>Girl:
No, I'm no... I'm not a witch! Please! Please, I beg you to reconsider! I'm not...
</line><line>Man:
Witches are to be cast straight into the hellfire!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?!
</line><line>Maya:
Nooooo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-so this is the-the Witches' Court...
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>Witches' Court</i>
</line><line>Maya:
So? How are you feeling, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
......... I'd forgotten what this felt like up until now.
</line><line>Maya:
...Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The butterflies in my stomach...and tension so thick you could slice it with a knife... All of these feelings... <textEffects>(...These are all feelings that I'm definitely familiar with!)</textEffects> Anyway... We're here to fight for Espella...and get her out of this place!
</line><line>Maya:
...That's right!
</line><line>Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Espella Cantabella. ...Defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour?
</line><line>Judge:
Yours is a face I have not seen in any past trials... But no matter... Start by stating your name, defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour! My name is Phoenix Wright, ace baker!
</line><line>Judge:
A baker?
</line><line>Espella:
I asked him to come, Milord! I want him to represent me. This court dictates that the accused is free to assign a defender of their choosing... Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
......... Hmm, very well. At any rate, the result of this trial shall not change...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
That aside... I have not yet seen hide nor hair of the inquisitor assigned to this trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Inquisitor"... Oh, right. I should've noticed earlier. No one's there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Should the assigned inquisitor fail to appear in court, I will have no choice but to dismiss all charges. He is an inquisitor of high calibre. But if he does not come forward soon... this trial will end, and victory will then be declared in favour of this baker!

<line>Judge:
Knights of the Court, I have but one question for you both... Are you prepared to cross swords?
</line><line>Barnham:
I, Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham, am indeed prepared to do battle, My Lord!
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
...Something amiss, baker?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honour. I just didn't realise we could have swords here in the courtroom.
</line><line>Barnham:
It is the way of the Court Knight. A knight must always ensure that he rides with a blade at his side. Now then... State your name, Sir Blue Knight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh? My name is Phoenix Wright. I'm a baker. <textEffects>(How many times will they make me say it...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
......... A baker?
</line><line>Maya:
Nick, quit with the long face! You look miserable!
</line><line>Barnham:
No need to waste your breath. This trial will be over before you can utter a single objection.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
For the security of all of Labyrinthia... my blade shall rend your defences swiftly and without mercy!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">That's it, Barnham! Put another one out of their misery!This trial is pointless! Hand down the verdict already!Put that doughy defender on trial too, I say!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh boy... What's with all this excitement? You'd hardly think this was a courtroom... The crowd doesn't seem very interested in law, that's for sure. It's like they're all just hoping for a <span style="color:#E16935">guilty verdict</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin your opening statement.
</line><line>Barnham:
...As you wish, Milord. First, let us begin by recounting the events leading up to the murder. ...Is that acceptable, Sir Apprentice Baker?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhh... "As you wish"...
</line><line>Barnham:
The murder occurred this very evening. Yesterday, there was heavy rainfall in the area. Eventually it gave way to sunshine... which came just in time for today's parade. Although a few hours after the parade ended, the rain set in once more.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That must have been when Espella and the others were at the Great Archive...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
It continued to rain until just before the incident, which took place on a small path leading to the market. The accused had been out doing some shopping at the market. She returned home on that very same path. And on that forest path, two rogues, named Robbs and Muggs, are said to have accosted the accused. One could assume the accused simply acted in "<textEffects>self-defence</textEffects>".
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Robbs and Muggs...those two have appeared in court a number of times in the past.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Two rogues, huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
So far, it may appear that the accused was more the "<textEffects>victim</textEffects>". However, the situation soon changed. That's right. The accused, Espella Cantabella... knowingly and mercilessly murdered her two assailants!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">..."Cantabella"......That girl, isn't she...?I always knew she looked suspicious!Shh! Not so loud...</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Y-yikes... There's that weird excitement again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we now fully grasp what happened. It is getting late already. ...Let us begin the trial. Inquisitor Barnham, you may now begin.
</line><line>Barnham:
As you wish, Milord. The inquisition will now hear <textEffects>eyewitness testimony</textEffects> regarding the night of the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Eyewitness testimony", huh...? Looks like this trial is finally getting under way... I can't back down now... I have to fight! But I'm just a simple bread-making baker... living a simple bread-making life... Urgh... This situation is more twisted than a pretzel...and I'm smack in the middle of it. But I have to do this to save Espella! Okay, let's see if I can untwist this testimony and put this thing to bed!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Barnham:
Allow me to welcome you all. Now, would each of you please state your name and occupation.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait a minute! Wh-what's going on here?!
</line><line>Barnham:
As I already explained, Sir Apprentice Baker, this is the "<textEffects>eyewitness testimony</textEffects>".
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I understand that, but... There are four witnesses!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. This many people inside the courtroom could pose a health and safety issue...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honour... That's, err...not quite what I meant! Witness testimonies are supposed to be done one-by-one... As in, one witness at a time...
</line><line>Mary:
What are you talking about, child? We'd be here all night if we did that!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
That's right, young man. We have witnessed the very hand of fate reach out to us this evening!
</line><line>Kira:
Um... Could we hurry this along, perhaps? These flowers won't sell themselves... as much as my boss wishes they would.
</line><line>Knightle:
The path to knighthood is an arduous one, but I remain steadfast in my resolve, as I travel down this long road! I shall not falter! I will be victorious!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Who cares?! Just question them all at once!We already know the girl in the cage did it! Let's get on with it!Yeah! Finish this already! I'd like to go back home and get to bed!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</captions>
<line>
Judge:
...Witnesses. Again, state your names and occupations.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
I am known as Wordsmith. But what is a name? How doth one describe an occupation? Like the bubbling of a babbling brook... I flow gracefully around the rocks and debris that is life, nary a worry in my mind.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Right...so I guess that means he's jobless.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mary:
My name is Mary. And this darling kid is Snowy.
</line><line>Snowy:
Baaa!
</line><line>Mary:
Snowy and I often travel to the edge of town to sell delicious fresh milk. Milk like that doesn't happen overnight! I work my hands to the bone squeezing each drop out...literally!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That sounds pretty frightening...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kira:
I'm Kira... I'm a flower seller. If you would all be so kind, feel free to purchase one of my beautiful flowers at any time during the trial. There's no way I'll sell them all by morning. Oh, the life of a flower girl is so hard...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeesh, talk about a hard sell...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Knightle:
My name is Knightle! I aim to join our town's order of knights! I study night and day, though I am still but a mere squire... Joining the Knights of the Inquisition is my life's ambition! And I, Knightle, will do whatever necessary to join!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...So he's jobless, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Honourable witnesses, I ask that you show this court your best when delivering your testimonies. Now, tell us what exactly you all saw on this ill-fated eve!

</line><line>Mary:
Muggs grabbed the girl by the arm. It looked like he almost pushed her to the ground!
</line><line>Kira:
I heard a faint voice cry out. The next moment, those two villainous men burst into flames!
</line><line>Knightle:
There was not a trace of fire to be seen in the area! Without a doubt, "<textEffects>magic</textEffects>" must have been used!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
M-magic...
</line><line>Judge:
Sir Apprentice Baker, you may now begin your interrogation.
</line><line>Barnham:
I have but one piece of advice. I suggest you pay it heed. Do not waste the court's time by grilling these witnesses over irrelevant nonsense, Sir Apprentice Baker.
</line><line>Maya:
Are you all right, Nick? They sure love calling you an <textEffects>apprentice baker</textEffects>, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll be honest with you, Maya, I have no idea how I'm feeling right now. But... I know it's all up to me. As her "<textEffects>defender</textEffects>", Espella's fate is in my hands.
</line><line>Maya:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have to believe in her... And I'll need to start believing in myself. I can do this... I believe Espella is innocent... And I'll fight until the end to prove it!
</line><line>Maya:
...Yeah, that's the spirit! We can do this thing, Nick!

</line><line>Knightle:
Wh-wh-what's with the sudden pointing?! I-I am a soon-to-be member of the honourable Knights of the Inquisition! I accept your challenge! Have at you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You say that no <textEffects>fire</textEffects> was present at the scene of the crime, meaning the defendant must have used <textEffects>magic</textEffects>. Unfortunately for you, that is not the case.
</line><line>Barnham:
...What do you mean, Sir Apprentice Baker?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What I mean is that the defendant was, in fact, carrying a <textEffects>lantern</textEffects>. ...A lantern containing fire! Those two "rogues" were actually burned by the flame that was inside that <textEffects>lantern</textEffects>... That is the only logical explanation!
</line><line>Barnham:
My, what a startling conclusion you've come to, Sir Apprentice Baker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
</line><line>Barnham:
"The only logical explanation"...? Do you agree with this statement, honourable witnesses?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
It is <textEffects>presumptuous</textEffects> for a man that knows nothing to claim that he knows something about which he really knows nothing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh?
</line><line>Mary:
...Besides, how could one <textEffects>teeny-tiny flame</textEffects> be strong enough to set them both ablaze like that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Uh.
</line><line>Kira:
There were two of them. How could that flame <textEffects>engulf them so fast</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ah.
</line><line>Knightle:
Furthermore! If they did burn as you claim they did, do you mean to suggest that they were <textEffects>soaked in oil</textEffects> or something?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Oh.
</line><line>Barnham:
Well, Sir Blue Knight? It would seem you have <textEffects>bitten off</textEffects> more than you can chew.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaarggggh! <textEffects>(I definitely didn't see that coming...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
What say you, Milord? Do you have any thoughts on the proceedings thus far?
</line><line>Judge:
............ Given the testimony as we have heard it... this court has come to its conclusion. 'Twas a truly gruesome and merciless act. An act for which only one thing could be held responsible... The nefarious crime of <textEffects>magic</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait just a second!
</line><line>Judge:
...Is there something you have forgotten to mention, defender?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not exactly, Your Honour. It's just that... I mean... You just said..."<textEffects>magic</textEffects>"... That can't be right, can it?!
</line><line>Barnham:
What are you suggesting, Sir Apprentice Baker? Witches use magic, which in turn brings about disaster. ...Such is the way of this world, is it not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-well, yeah... <textEffects>(That may seem to be the case... but no way is that actually <span style="color:#E16935">possible</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
This court finds Espella Cantabella, the accused, charged with being a <textEffects>witch</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Espella...a witch...?
</line><line>Barnham:
A witch's existence in this world is a crime in itself.
</line><line>Judge:
The ability to use and control magic is a criminal offence, indeed... As such, any witch found practising magic will be sentenced to death by fire!
</line><line>Espella:
N-no! You're wrong! I'm not a witch!
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Apprentice Baker, I do not envy your current predicament. Milord! Hand down your guilty verdict against this witch immediately!

</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but! There's no evidence to prove that any "magic" was really used!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Put a sock in it, bread boy! We all heard her cast the spell!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh?
</line><line>Mary:
That's right! Snowy and I heard it! Isn't that right, precious? We heard that <textEffects>incantation</textEffects> quite clearly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Uh.
</line><line>Kira:
That frightening voice... There's no mistaking it! It was Espella's voice!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ah.
</line><line>Knightle:
These ears do not lie! I clearly heard an incantation most sinister! "<textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects>", it went!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>Incantation</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Maya:
<textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's no good! I just can't wrap my head around this topsy-turvy, other-worldly court.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Well then, it would seem the defence has no further objections.
</line><line>Judge:
...It appears so. The court finds the use of <textEffects>magic</textEffects> at the time of the murder to be an undeniable fact. Furthermore, the honourable witnesses have stated that they each heard an <textEffects>incantation</textEffects> being recited. The court finds no reason to delay its verdict any longer.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! We have to do something...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I know! But... What exactly can we say? Here, in this world, our sense of <textEffects>logic</textEffects> is completely useless!

I have something I believe will be of use to the defence... A <textEffects>weapon</textEffects>, of sorts.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-that's...
</line><line>Layton:
...The <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects>. All of this world's magic is contained within its pages. Without it, this trial cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion.

Of course! The professor always helps people in trouble! "It is the duty of every gentleman", right, Professor?
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Professor...?
</line><line>Layton:
...There is a saying that I find quite useful in situations such as this. "There is a time for words and a time for action."
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-right...
</line><line>Layton:
You have been working as a baker in this town up until now, have you not? I must say, I am a little mystified. I'd have expected you to be more familiar with this world and its "system" of magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, yeah... How can I put this... I guess that's not quite the full story.
</line><line>Layton:
Is that so...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I kind of had an epiphany just now. I remembered all sorts of things... Like how I'm not actually a baker... And, well...how magic can't really exist!
</line><line>Layton:
............ Then it would seem I was correct about you, Mr Wright. You are not, in fact, a citizen of this town... Is that correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Right. At least, it seems that way.
</line><line>Layton:
However, for now, we have no option but to accept this world and its <textEffects>rules</textEffects> as a reality. Without first understanding those rules, I'm afraid you will not be able to save Miss Cantabella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but...things like <textEffects>magic</textEffects> only exist in fairy tales and make-believe!
</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid, Mr Wright, it would seem magic does in fact "<textEffects>exist</textEffects>" in this world. Such a truth cannot be denied.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed...that is why the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects> is a weapon well suited for this witch trial. At the moment, you are tantamount to a knight without a sword.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I feel more like an attorney without a chance, actually...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Luke:
Right then, Mr Wright! I'll explain how the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects> works! Have a look at the Touch Screen! There, you'll see the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects> button! Touching the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects> button will open up the Grand Grimoire!
</line><line>Layton:
You will be able to <textEffects>present</textEffects> spells from the Grand Grimoire in much the same way you would present evidence. This book will surely be a most important asset for us in this trial.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Luke:
Oh, that reminds me. I've gone ahead and bookmarked the spell <textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects> for you!
</line><line>The spell Ignaize has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
<textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects>... That's the magic spell all of the witnesses said they heard, right? Nick, you should take a look at that spell!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(All I have to do is touch the <span style="color:#E16935">Grand Grimoire</textEffects> button, huh?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
The defender has been given more than enough time. It would seem this trial has reached its end.
</line><line>Barnham:
Is that understood, Sir Apprentice Baker? This case is quite straightforward, with very little room for doubt. The witnesses' testimony, coupled with the illustration of the time of the murder, makes it quite clear what must have occurred. This murder was the result of <textEffects>magic</textEffects>... And furthermore, the caster of said magic was none other than <textEffects>the accused</textEffects>. That, Sir Apprentice Baker, is the truth! Best you go back to baking, for I believe your days in the courtroom have crumbled!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaargh!
</line><line>Layton:
Is everything okay, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes!
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm... It would seem that photographs <textEffects>do not exist</textEffects> in this world.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Photos don't...exist? <textEffects>(I guess that makes sense... "ye olde" time period and all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
The <textEffects>sketch</textEffects> drawn by the Court Illustrator... Therein lies your final chance, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
My...final chance...
</line><line>Layton:
I understand the witnesses have already finished their testimony... However... If you could perhaps find a clear <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> within this illustration...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's another contradiction...? In that case, there's still hope that I can <span style="color:#E16935">turn this around</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Luke:
M-Mr Wright! You have to hurry! Look! The judge... He looks ready to deliver his verdict any second now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is it. This is my last chance... What...should I do?!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
One second, Your Honour. The defence requests permission to have another look at the court illustration. I think...there might be a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> in there!
</line><line>Barnham:

You are already out of time. All testimony and evidence given thus far has <i>[sic]</i> been proven to be accurate.

</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't be so sure, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's just one thing you've overlooked. A piece of evidence within this book...
</line><line>Judge:
Th-the Grand Grimoire...
</line><line>Barnham:
...Absurd! I overlooked something...? You are the defender here. You should have examined the tome earlier.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're right, I should have... But unfortunately, I was nothing but a simple baker until just now.
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Interesting. You've certainly begun to show your true colours, Sir Blue Knight. Let us see what type of knight you truly are. Have at you!
</line><line>Judge:
The defender will now show us this supposed <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">court illustration</textEffects>...and the <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects>... Somewhere there's a contradiction between those two, and I've got to find it! This is my last chance!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Defender, use this <textEffects>magnifying glass</textEffects> to locate the point of relevance. Then reveal to the court the location of this "<textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>"!
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The contradiction is...right here!
</line><line>Judge:
The <textEffects>hand</textEffects> of the accused? She seems to be holding a lantern...
</line><line>Barnham:
...What is your point?
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to this tome, using the spell Ignaize... requires the use of the <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects>, as well as an incantation...isn't that right?
</line><line>Barnham:
Correct. For witches to use magic, they must be in possession of a witch's sceptre, also known as a <textEffects>Talea Magica</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that's the case, then there's one thing that doesn't add up. Take another look at Ms Cantabella's hands. Tell me, do you see the <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects> in either of her hands?
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There we go! Let's see you point that sword at me now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Luke:
You did it, Mr Wright! But...wasn't that contradiction just a little too obvious?
</line><line>Layton:
............ You may be right, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
Eh?
</line><line>Layton:
It would certainly appear... that the good inquisitor is taking this particular oversight rather too well.
</line><line>Barnham:
That is correct, Sir Apprentice Baker. But you should not underestimate me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
This is perhaps your first time seeing this item, is it not? Right here is the very <textEffects>sceptre</textEffects> you mention. One of the witnesses found it tossed in the shrubbery on the side of the path.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Aha! Yes! Indeed, that was I! I located it! My feet found themselves ensnared in the blasted thing, and it sent me flying through the air!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Somehow...I'm not surprised to hear you fell, gramps.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... This sceptre does seem to carry a most sinister air...
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed, Milord. However, this sceptre will only work while in the hands of a witch, with the incantation being said aloud.
</line><line>Maya:
Aww... That's too bad... I wanted to try lighting some stuff on fire.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Please don't look at ME when you say that.
</line><line>Barnham:
You see, there are two <textEffects>magic gems</textEffects> set in this sceptre.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Magic gems... <textEffects>(Looks like a red gem and a white gem...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
These gems each contain a particular magic spell. By simply looking at these magic gems, one can easily determine which <textEffects>magic spell</textEffects> can be used.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Quick, look at this page!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that...the red <span style="color:#E16935">magic gem</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed. The red gem you see here is the spell <textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects>. And if you look carefully... you should notice that this sceptre also has <textEffects>one more spell</textEffects> that can be used.
</line><line>Phoenix:
One more spell... <textEffects>(That must be the white gem!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Wright, I've found it! Here's the spell for the white magic gem!
</line><line>The spell Dimere has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Causes anything the caster touches to vanish from sight"... Urgh!
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmph. I see you managed to work it out in that crusty head of yours.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-that's just... It can't be! The reason the witch's sceptre couldn't be seen is because the magic spell Dimere <textEffects>had made it disappear</textEffects>...
</line><line>Barnham:
That's right. In other words... The accused conjured a cowardly spell to <textEffects>camouflage</textEffects> her own use of magic!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no... Nooooooo waaaaaaaaaaaay!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Inquisitor Barnham, please submit the sceptre into evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
H-hold on! Please!
</line><line>Judge:
Is there a problem, Sir Baker?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, I understand this is a witch's sceptre. However! Whether or not the sceptre was in Ms Cantabella's possession has not yet been proven!
</line><line>Barnham:
What are you talking about, Sir Apprentice Baker?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Isn't it obvious? ...I'm talking about <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects>. Supposing Ms Cantabella did in fact handle this witch's sceptre, then her <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> should still be on it!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Judge:

</line><line>Maya:

<captions aligned="center">............</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-what's with this silence...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You said..."<textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects>"? Inquisitor Barnham, tell me... Just what is this baker blabbering about?
</line><line>Barnham:
I haven't the slightest clue, Milord. It is the baker's first time in court, after all...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh?
</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid it's no use, Mr Wright. In this world, it would seem the concept of fingerprinting does not yet <textEffects>exist</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! <textEffects>(I...I can't believe it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
As I have said already, best you head back to the bakery, lest you continue to serve this court more of your half-baked ideas.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They're about as <span style="color:#E16935">half-baked</textEffects> as your terrible puns, Barnham...)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
Forensic science does not exist here... Instead, this is a world in which "witches" and "magic" are accepted as fact. ...Truly fascinating.
</line><line>Talea Magica added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What the heck?! There are just...way too many things I don't know about this world!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright. I believe you may be able to take these things you <textEffects>don't know</textEffects> and use them to your advantage.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Barnham:
The inquisition believes there is no room for debate on this matter. The accused clearly attempted to conceal her magic. Better luck next time, Sir Apprentice Baker. Mayhap your next loaf will not leave such a bitter taste in our mouths. Now then, Milord! I believe it is time. I ask that you render your unwavering verdict!
</line><line>Layton:

</line><line>Layton:
Pardon the interruption. May I have a word, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
What's that...? Who might you be?
</line><line>Layton:
My name is Hershel Layton. I am a friend of the accused. Inquisitor Barnham, please allow me to confirm what you believe happened on the night of the crime. You claim the witch's sceptre was made to disappear through the use of magic, is that correct?
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed. Through the magic spell <textEffects>Dimere</textEffects>.
</line><line>Layton:
If possible, would you mind providing <textEffects>proof</textEffects> of this particular claim?
</line><line>Barnham:
What...?
</line><line>Layton:
You claim the sceptre was <textEffects>not seen</textEffects>... Indeed, that is one possibility. However, a wise man must always consider every possibility.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... What say you, Inquisitor Barnham? Can the inquisition fulfil the request presented by the gentleman with the...unusual hat?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ The inquisition cannot honour this request for proof. If you are asserting that the accused is not a witch, then the burden of proof lies at the feet of the defender.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(C'mon! It's the prosecu- ...err, inquisition's job to prove that a crime was committed!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
As I thought... Indeed, it would appear the accepted method of thinking in this world differs greatly from our own.
</line><line>Barnham:
How regrettable, Sir Apprentice Baker... and you, Sir Dark Hat.

</line><line>Mary:
Snowy and I will not be dismissed so easily! We came here to expose the identity of this witch! Isn't that right, precious?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
A witch's sceptre, you say? Yes, yes! I know of such a sceptre! Allow me to elucidate the matter!
</line><line>Layton:
What do you think, Inquisitor Barnham? Your witnesses appear to have something to say on the subject.
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Very well. Most honourable witnesses, I grant your request to testify once more! Tell the court all you know regarding this Talea Magica!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ulp... Well, we've somehow managed to keep the trial going. I owe you one, "Sir Dark Hat"...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Kira:
I got a good look at her hand, and it looked for certain that she was gripping something.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
The witch was holding a sceptre in her right hand! She did not drop it once before she was apprehended!

<hr />
<line>Judge:
I see. The accused's hand was "contorted in a <textEffects>strange way</textEffects>"... I do believe this is quite an important piece of testimony.
</line><line>Kira:
I saw it! I most certainly saw it! She was holding an invisible sceptre!
</line><line>Mary:
We saw it too! It was the girl up there! Without a doubt!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
I, as well. These old eyes don't see as well as they once did, but I witnessed the hazy, blurry form of the accused quite clearly!

</line><line>Barnham:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What I mean, Inquisitor Barnham, is that this lantern proves the defendant was not holding the sceptre!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Meaning she could have held the sceptre? I'm afraid that's not the problem here, Inquisitor Barnham. The problem is with the broken glass... and the mud plastered all over it!
</line><line>Barnham:
What...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The rain had ended just as the murder was taking place. That would make the path fairly <textEffects>muddy</textEffects>, don't you agree? When the thieves grabbed Ms Cantabella by the arm...the lantern must have fallen into the mud.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
The lantern...
</line><line>Knightle:
Fell into the mud...
</line><line>Mary:
Why, of course. That makes sense, doesn't it, my little Snowy-wowy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, what do you say, Inquisitor Barnham? If she was holding the sceptre at that time, that would mean that when she dropped the lantern, the sceptre would have fallen along with it!

S-so that you can...understand...? Well, I mean, it's pretty obvious just by looking at it...
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Wh-what is it, Mr Layton?
</line><line>Layton:
There is something about this witness...
</line><line>Kira:
...?
</line><line>Layton:
Miss Kira, was it? Tell me, Miss Kira... How good is your <textEffects>eyesight</textEffects>, exactly?
</line><line>Kira:
Huh...?!
</line><line>Layton:
As you just heard Mr Wright explain, the answer to your query is quite obvious at a glance. Tell me, are you able to see the <textEffects>mud</textEffects> present on this lantern?
</line><line>Kira:
...Mud...? What mud? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Layton:
Your Honour, did you hear that just now?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? Ah...yes, indeed. Wh-what does it mean...exactly?
</line><line>Layton:
It means that Miss Kira's poor eyesight is the reason she cannot see the mud present on this lantern. In other words, the validity of Miss Kira's testimony is questionable, at best.
</line><line>Kira:
...Urk... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Wh-what is the meaning of this?
</line><line>Barnham:
...What say you in your defence, witness? I highly recommend you give us nothing but the truth.
</line><line>Kira:
I-I'm sorry, Inquisitor Barnham! I-it's true. I need to wear glasses...all the time, in fact.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-you need to wear glasses?!
</line><line>Mary:
Ah ha! Now that you mention it, I did notice something odd about you today.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Oho! I thought you looked familiar! Gone is the mist that clouded my mind! In its place...clarity.
</line><line>Knightle:
Fair maiden, a pair of spectacles are as valuable as a shield to a knight. Make haste and procure another pair!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now then, Ms Kira, tell me... At the time of the incident, were you wearing your glasses?
</line><line>Kira:
............ No. No, I was not wearing them. The truth is, I... I lost my glasses a couple of days ago...
</line><line>Barnham:
You lost them...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So, her glasses were missing during the time of the incident...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, might I recommend that you keep note of this fact. It could prove useful later.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Got it!
</line><line>Glasses added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Am I to believe there is nothing left to prove on this matter? At the time of the murder, the accused <textEffects>did not have</textEffects> a witch's sceptre in her possession...

<line>Phoenix:
All of your testimonies have come to the same conclusion. The sceptre was not in her right hand with the lantern. Therefore, it must have been in her other hand, that was holding the bucket. However, that's not it. Not by a long shot.
</line><line>Barnham:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Contrary to what one of the witnesses stated, the milk bucket was in fact at the crime scene. And you'll also notice something about this bucket... Take another look at the court illustration. Something about the bucket seems a bit... odd, wouldn't you say?
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, Inquisitor Barnham... It's <textEffects>highly likely</textEffects> that this illustration is much less accurate than you think. In fact, there is a blatant contradiction present in this illustration! Admittedly, it does at first look possible that Ms Cantabella was holding the sceptre and the bucket at the same time. However, if you look at the real milk bucket, that <textEffects>possibility</textEffects> goes up in smoke! Here, let's have a look at the real deal... Notice the <textEffects>handle</textEffects>?
</line><line>Barnham:
...Ngh! Th-that...cannot be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, but it is. This particular milk bucket has two pieces of wood on either side of the handle. If you were to try and hold both the sceptre and this bucket... Well, let's just say that'd be a <textEffects>challenge</textEffects>. To put it simply... there is no way anyone could hold both the bucket and the sceptre at once!
</line><line>Knightle:
Wh-whaaaaaaaa?!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Th-that must mean...clearly you have the wrong bucket!
</line><line>Mary:
We never lie when it comes to milk! That is the very bucket I took!
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It looks like the witnesses are as surprised about this as Barnham...)</textEffects> The defendant couldn't have been able to hold the bucket and the sceptre at once. Also...we have already established that she was not holding a sceptre in her right hand. Therefore... the defendant, Ms Espella Cantabella... was not holding a witch's sceptre at any point during the incident!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! I said order! J-just what... What is the meaning of this?! In all my days as judge of this court, I have never heard such an argument! These are but a paltry set of words... And yet, they ring with such remarkable strength!
</line><line>Layton:
...Your Honour. What you just heard...was <textEffects>logic</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Luke:

</line><line>Barnham:
...Most intriguing. A knight allows his sword to speak for him during battle... You have spoken with a "sword of words". So be it... I, too, shall wield such a blade.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, there appears to be a hole in this..."logic" of yours.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A "hole"...?
</line><line>Barnham:
According to the earlier testimony, it was believed the accused had the lantern hanging from her wrist by the handle. However, she supposedly dropped it, hence it being covered in mud.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right.
</line><line>Barnham:
While that may be true... it does not necessarily mean the accused was therefore unable to use magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
It is merely a question of <textEffects>when</textEffects> she dropped the witch's sceptre...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what do you mean, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
It is very simple, Milord. The accused, while first holding the lantern and the witch's sceptre, cast her magic. Then, she dropped both the lantern and the sceptre.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... The witch's sceptre was dropped <textEffects>after</textEffects> the spell was cast... O-of course...yes, that must be it!
</line><line>Barnham:
...What say you? Sir Blue Knight? That is but a taste of the knightly knowledge of the Inquisition!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Wow! Sir Barnham cut through that baker's "witchery" like a hot knife through butter!Exemplary! I expected nothing less from the "Hand of Barnham"!Oooh, to be able to shake that powerful hand someday!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</captions>

Layton:
That inquisitor...isn't quite what he first appeared.

<textEffects>(I knew it. I caught her completely by surprise...)</textEffects> Mr Wordsmith just gave his testimony... He told us all about the sound he heard when the lantern fell to the ground.

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Huh...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mary:
Well, we'll try and explain...won't we, Snowy? The truth is, we did hear something. That is to say...we heard the <textEffects>sound</textEffects> of the lantern's glass shattering. We're sure of it! It was frighteningly loud.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Mary:
It quite startled us, didn't it, Snowy dear? I looked in the direction of the sound, but... I couldn't see anything, let alone the girl or those two thieves. It...was a tad dark, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
When the glass shattered, the flame inside must have gone out. Hence she could not see them. ...That seems to be the gist of it.
</line><line>Mary:
Th-then, as I peered into the darkness, I...h-heard it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You "heard it"...? What did you hear, exactly?

U-uh...yes. M-Maybe... I think.

H-how about my testimony?! Wh-what of my oratorical observation? That blasted spell, Ignaize, occurred first. Then the lantern plummeted to the ground!

</line><line>Phoenix:
I hate to disappoint you, but that's not quite the case. In fact, this testimony changes things a lot. Wouldn't you agree, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Let's go over what we know so far. In order for a witch to use any magic, they must be holding a witch's sceptre. And yet, none of the four witnesses saw the defendant holding a "sceptre" of any kind.
</line><line>Judge:
That's because the sceptre was made to <textEffects>disappear</textEffects> with the spell Dimere, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
At the time of the crime, the two victims grabbed Ms Cantabella's arm, causing her to drop the lantern on to the ground. If, at the time, she was in fact holding an "invisible sceptre"... then the sceptre must have fallen when she dropped the lantern. Now, let's say, hypothetically...that Ms Cantabella really is a witch... In order to use any magic, she would have had to recite the spell <textEffects>before</textEffects> dropping the sceptre. However! As our witness, Ms Mary, has just stated in her testimony... She heard the incantation for Ignaize <textEffects>after</textEffects> hearing the lantern's glass shatter.

Hmph! Such nonsense! Did any of you even listen to my testimony?
</line><line>Kira:
We did, but you're wrong! There was no "glass shattering"!
</line><line>Mary:
Are you calling me a liar, missy? You couldn't even see the mud on the lantern, when it was plain as day!

...Witnesses. This is a court of law... not a playground. Must I remind you of the importance of these proceedings? Witches and their magic threaten our fair town of Labyrinthia. Your words here today...could decide the fate of every single citizen within our walls. Do you understand? As such, I expect each of you to take your role seriously and testify honestly about what you saw!

I-in all my days as judge of this court, I have never seen such behaviour... Behaviour that leaves a cloud of doubt over the credibility of each of your testimonies!

Indeed, Milord... Quite a miserable set of witnesses, this lot.
</line><line>Layton:
...Hmm, I see. It would appear...this trial has come to a sudden halt.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? So...that must mean!
</line><line>Layton:
Quite right. It means you have <textEffects>won</textEffects> this trial, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(We've..."won"...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I-I can hardly believe the situation we have found ourselves in... I did not anticipate this trial ending...with such a strange turn of events. But due to these witnesses' dubious credibility, I can see no reason to continue. ...What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ As you wish, Milord.

Thank goodness you showed up!

<line>Judge:
Well, then... We will now continue with the trial of Espella Cantabella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh boy... A group of witnesses huddling up before a joint testimony in a witch trial... You can't make this stuff up.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Inquisitor Barnham. If I may ask you a question.
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes...Milord?
</line><line>Judge:
We now have five witnesses on the stand... So, I must ask... Why was this obnoxious-looking man <textEffects>left out</textEffects> of your initial group of witnesses?
</line><line>Some Guy:
Baldy's right, Barnham! That's just cold-blooded!
</line><line>Barnham:
There is but one reason, Milord. I did not know this "witness" even <textEffects>existed</textEffects>.
</line><line>Some Guy:
Eh?
</line><line>Barnham:
You, sir, failed to come forward... When we were asking for witnesses for this very trial, you were nowhere to be seen!
</line><line>Some Guy:
That's 'cos I didn't hear a peep about it! I ain't usually around at night, except for maybe at Rouge's tavern!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So...you're basically telling us that you were up all night drinking...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Some Guy:
Hmph, anyway. It's all water under the bridge now, s'far as I'm concerned! Just leave the rest to yours truly! Har har har har har har har har haaaaaaar!
</line><line>Judge:
During the last interrogation, the defender brought forth some surprising proof. Namely that there was little possibility the accused could have used magic... I have never heard such a claim. It must be the doing of this..."logic".
</line><line>Some Guy:
What rubbish! "Lodge...ick", y'say? I ain't got a clue what that is! But I do know that 'dis bread bakin'... BAKER oughta head back to the bakery!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Eloquently said...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Some Guy:
Oi! Gramps! Give me and my partners over here a chance to speak! You wanna know how this witch managed to be holdin' that sceptre, don't cha?
</line><line>Judge:
............ Oh! When you say "gramps"... you wouldn't mean me, would you?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
I fail to see anyone else meeting such a description!
</line><line>Kira:
We'll... We'll show you she's a witch!
</line><line>Mary:

<line>Kira:
It's clear as day...Espella is a witch! We are NOT backing down on this!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
When she dropped the lantern, the sceptre was not yet in her hands.
</line><line>Mary:
The sceptre must have been hidden by magic and carried on her back.
</line><line>Knightle:
The rogues grabbed her by the hand that held the lantern, so she must have had another way of holding that sceptre.
</line><line>Some Guy:
That's easy! The girl just put the bucket down on the ground and picked up the witch's scep...scept...magic stick!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...So, she had the witch's sceptre behind her back. She then dropped the lantern and reached for the sceptre after it fell. If that is the case...then it must have been possible for the accused to have used magic!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is bad... Thanks to this guy, now all the witnesses seem extra determined to pin this thing on Espella...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
They each harbour a shared anger towards witches and magic... Such is the cause of their strong desire to see a guilty verdict passed as quickly as possible. However, such confidence... is undoubtedly bound to cloud their better judgement and thinking.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, I think you're right. <textEffects>(I don't think these guys mean any real harm, but... they're all riled up, they don't even realise how distorted their idea of what happened tonight has become. At least, that's how it seems.)</textEffects>

Th-this isn't good, Professor! The witnesses aren't thinking straight! They're completely blind to the truth!
</line><line>Judge:
............ Sir Baker. Erm...rather, Sir Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes!
</line><line>Judge:
You do not appear to be a mere simple baker...that much is clear. On the other hand... you are no ordinary defender either.
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Never before... has a defender managed to clash and do battle with me here, on this battlefield, as an equal.

Sir Blue Knight. ...This trial has not yet been decided. If there is any doubt in your interrogation... I will not hesitate to strike your case down where it stands!

Excuse me, uh...mister?

</line><line>Phoenix:
U-um...earth to gramps?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Defender, when you say "<textEffects>gramps</textEffects>"... might you, by any chance, be referring to me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, no! Of course not, Your Honour! Mr Wordsmith, are you listening?!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
............ I heard you quite clearly the first time, young man. These ears hear all... The crackling of the fire...the whispering of the crowd...and now, your voice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that's the case, then allow me to ask you a question. You were clearly <textEffects>deep in thought</textEffects> just now... Do you have something to say about this man's testimony?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
............ Indeed so. I felt something was <textEffects>amiss</textEffects>. However...what that means, I cannot say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Amiss...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Witness, could you tell us... what precisely was <textEffects>amiss</textEffects> with this third-rate testimony from this third-rate witness?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What a burn, Barnham...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Wordsmith:
<textEffects>Five heads</textEffects> are better than one... <textEffects>Ten eyeballs</textEffects> are better than two... ...As I listened to this man's testimony, I could not help but become aware of something most odd. Tonight, when the crime occurred...we all made haste to that terrible scene. The delicious scent of mid-evening dinner permeated through the air, the shadows of those present cast through the dim light... And yet, there were but <textEffects>four figures</textEffects> standing in that vicinity, myself included.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Four</textEffects>...? H-hold on one second! You're saying that there were only... <textEffects>four witnesses</textEffects> at the crime scene tonight?
</line><line>Wordsmith:
............ These eyes may be old, but they know what they saw!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... Is something the matter, Ms Mary?
</line><line>Mary:
No...it's just that...Snowy and I are trying to remember what happened at the time. I remember the flames erupting into the air. That's when Snowy and I made our mad dash to save the precious milk... And when those two ruffians were set ablaze, the flame filled the area with light. In that sudden flash of light, we could see that there were other people around, besides ourselves. And that's when I saw them... The other people that scrambled to the scene along with us. I'm quite sure of it. There were only <textEffects>four</textEffects> of us there at the scene of the crime.

</line><line>Barnham:
H-hold it, madam! Y-you... This... What in blazes is going on?! We have <textEffects>five witnesses</textEffects> on the stand, all claiming to have witnessed tonight's events first-hand. That means we have...one witness too many!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Don't be stupiiiiiiiiid!</captions>
<line>
Some Guy:
Oi! You lot better stop speakin' outta turn! "All for one and one for all", remember? We all promised to take this witch down together, didn't we?!
</line><line>Mary:
It's not quite that simple! We saw what we saw!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Well, I say it's all about the numbers! And I counted! I counted, I say! I'll have you know my counting is flawless! On nights when sleep eludes me, I can count sheep from moonrise to sunrise!
</line><line>Kira:
Four witnesses, five witnesses... What difference does it make?! Things all started getting muddled when YOU showed up!
</line><line>Some Guy:
Wh-what the...?! You sayin' it's MY fault?! I was there, you fool! Didn't I just finish sayin' that?!
</line><line>Knightle:
My testimony is strong as steel! ...Even if it's not completely stainless!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! I said order! Wh-what... What is going on here? You claim the number of witnesses does not add up?! I have never paid witness to such an outrageous conflict!
</line><line>Layton:
There is but one answer to this puzzle. A single possibility...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what do you mean...?
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
Without a doubt, "magic" must have been used at the scene of the crime. Furthermore, it would indeed appear that there were only four witnesses present at the scene... And yet, currently, we are faced with five witnesses testifying to the court. That certainly is quite a fatal <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>... with only one possible answer. Would you not agree, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(The answer...it can't be...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Well, out with this supposed "answer", Sir Blue Knight! What is your explanation for the current number of witnesses?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
While it might seem far-fetched, the reality is actually rather simple. The real witch...and the real murderer in this case... is actually <textEffects>one</textEffects> of these <textEffects>five</textEffects> witnesses!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wha...
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Barnham:
You're telling us that the witch is amongst this group of witnesses?! What utter rubbish! ...There is no possible way that such a claim could be true!
</line><line>Some Guy:
Th-tha's right! You've got a lotta nerve accusin' one of us of bein' a witch!
</line><line>Mary:
We have told you nothing but the truth... yet you still have the gall to bat around such an outrageous accusation?!
</line><line>Knightle:
Behold! Behold, as my trusty shield deflects your petty words like...the petty words that they are!
</line><line>Judge:
............ Inquisitor Barnham...
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes, Milord?
</line><line>Judge:
I would like to see a sketch of the crime scene at the time of the incident. Do you have one in your possession?
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes... Certainly, Milord. I have one here. I requested it from the Court Illustrator, just in case...
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. Witnesses! I would like each of you to mark your location at the time of the murder... here on this crime scene sketch! ...Quickly, now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The number of witnesses doesn't add up... It looks like we're getting somewhere now. But we haven't even scratched the surface of this case yet! And it's all thanks to this top-hat-wearing gentleman...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...The court accepts this crime scene sketch into evidence!
</line><line>Area Map added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If one of the witnesses is the witch... That could only mean one thing. Somebody here <span style="color:#E16935">isn't telling the truth</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
That would indeed appear to be the case, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Barnham:
...Listen well, Sir Blue Knight. The path you tread now is a dangerous one. Claiming that a witch is among these most honourable witnesses... is a serious accusation. Should it prove to be a false one... you will find yourself at the other end of my sword. Do I make myself clear?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? But, that...that wasn't so much my suggestion... I mean, the gentleman here with the lovely top hat was the one who urged me to say it.
</line><line>Barnham:
It is the same thing, Sir Blue Knight.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. It is the same thing, Sir Baker.
</line><line>Layton:
It is the same thing, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh boy...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
...Now! <textEffects>Ready</textEffects> your sword!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-ready...?
</line><line>Barnham:
...Were you listening? You claim the witch is not the accused and that someone else <textEffects>at the crime scene</textEffects> was the true culprit. If what you say is true, then surely you can tell the court exactly <textEffects>where this person was at the time of the crime</textEffects>...can you not? Come now, Sir Blue Knight. Only you can <textEffects>enlighten</textEffects> us as to who this "real witch" actually is!
</line><line>Judge:
Sir Doughy Defender. Show us where the witch was at the exact moment the <textEffects>murder took place</textEffects>!
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The witch must have been standing...here!

</line><line>Phoenix:
...Inquisitor Barnham, I suggest you try taking a look at this.
</line><line>Barnham:
The <textEffects>Grand Grimoire</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to this tome, Ignaize summons a circle of flame...within a <textEffects>one metre</textEffects> radius of the caster. In other words, the witch had to have been within one metre of the flame when casting the spell!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
...Of course. You needn't say any more, Sir Blue Knight. First off, notice that there is no one else in that area other than the accused! It should also be quite obvious from the sketch that there is clearly nowhere for anyone to hide!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
True. There aren't any hiding spots... However... there is one other possibility, if a witch wanted to stay <textEffects>hidden from sight</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Most intriguing... Since you seem to love showing evidence... prove it! How was the witch able to hide in plain sight?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
...This Talea Magica contains two <textEffects>magic gems</textEffects>. Ignaize and one other spell... That's right. The spell <textEffects>Dimere</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Dimere... Ah! I-it cannot be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's right. There was most certainly a witch present at the crime scene. Only...they were completely invisible... All thanks to the magic spell <textEffects>Dimere</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what FOOLISHNESS is this?!
</line><line>Judge:

</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the Grand Grimoire, under the entry for <textEffects>Dimere</textEffects>... It "causes anything the caster touches to vanish from sight". In other words... Supposing the witch were holding the staff in one hand, while touching part of their <textEffects>body</textEffects> with the other... They would be able to make themself disappear.
</line><line>Barnham:
A-are you... Are you implying that is the reason for the conflicting number of witnesses?!
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, it is! Which means, witnesses... someone amongst you is not disclosing the entire truth, and that person is the witch we seek. I believe this is the most probable scenario.
</line><line>Judge:
Honourable witnesses... You will testify to the court one final time. Tell us exactly <textEffects>what you saw and what you did not see</textEffects> at the scene of the crime...
</line><line>Wordsmith:
H-how absurdly absurd! The purpose of this trial is to convict THAT girl of the crime, is it not?!
</line><line>Mary:
That's right! W-we...are NOT witches!
</line><line>Layton:
...Witnesses, I ask that you listen.
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Layton:
There is a witch mingling among you. ...That's right. I'm afraid you are all no longer "brothers in arms". The true <textEffects>opponent</textEffects> here...is <textEffects>within your own group</textEffects>.

Um, excuse me, mist- ...I mean, Emeer!
</line><line>Emeer:
Ah, don't sweat it, Bluey. "Mister", "Hey You"... it's all the same to me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You stated that you heard your name being called from <textEffects>behind</textEffects>... Are you absolutely sure about that?
</line><line>Emeer:
Ah...well, right or wrong, it sure sounded like me name. I mean, what else could it have been? I wouldn't have remembered it happenin' if I hadn't heard somethin', right? Still... Maybe there's a chance I just imagined it, huh? But anyway, I remember it came from somewhere behind me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(From <span style="color:#E16935">somewhere behind</textEffects> you...?)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
...Is something the matter, Mr Wright?

Mr...err, Emeer's memory isn't the most accurate, but if what he says is true... then there's definitely <textEffects>something</textEffects> there.
</line><line>Layton:
"Something", you say...? Might you mean... A <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I think so. Although... I don't know. There's just...something <textEffects>strange</textEffects> about his testimony... <textEffects>(I don't see any decisive <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</textEffects> in the Court Record that can help...)</span>

</line><line>Barnham:
Milord, this line of interrogation is a complete waste of the court's time.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Defender, I must warn you. From here on... any unnecessary questioning will be dealt with accordingly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(If I don't answer <span style="color:#E16935">correctly</textEffects> here... it's curtains for the trial and for Espella!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:

<textEffects>(There's not one single piece of decisive evidence in the Court Record... ...What do I do now?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mr Layton!
</line><line>Layton:
I have an idea. I believe...there is a <textEffects>weapon</textEffects>, of sorts, with which you may be able to expose this contradiction without the need of evidence.

</line><line>Layton:
...If I may interrupt for just a moment, Inquisitor Barnham. Allow me to ask you this: what need is there for common sense in a world that foregoes using it? Accordingly, I must humbly ask that you discard such a manner of thinking.
</line><line>Barnham:
Whatever do you mean...?
</line><line>Layton:
You have my utmost thanks for placing your trust in me, Mr Wright. Let us discuss the one <textEffects>remaining weapon</textEffects> in this cross-examination.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...The "<span style="color:#E16935">remaining weapon</textEffects>"...?)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
This trial has taught us a valuable new technique to be used in the courtroom, has it not?
</line><line>Luke:
You mean...<textEffects>questioning</textEffects>... Right, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed it is, Luke. Each of the witnesses in this trial has given their own account of what occurred. Therefore...whenever one witness has testified, the other remaining witnesses have listened. ...That gives me an idea. In addition to catching a witness off guard and questioning them about another's testimony, there is...one more thing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's something else we can get from a five-person cross-examination...?)</textEffects> ...! Th-that's right, of course!
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Mr Wright...<textEffects>contradictions</textEffects>. Should <textEffects>one witness' <i>[sic]</i> testimony differ from another's testimony</textEffects>, then... I suppose that in itself can also be considered a contradiction, can it not...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Testimony contradicting testimony... I never would've thought of that until now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Enough. Sir Blue Knight, are you prepared to present to the court... evidence proving the contradiction within this witness' <i>[sic]</i> testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witness' <i>[sic]</i> testimony...does not contradict any evidence. It contradicts a <textEffects>testimony</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what are you talking about...?
</line><line>Layton:
It is time, Mr Wright! Have a look at the <textEffects>Touch Screen</textEffects>. There, you will see the testimony of the witness in question, as well as those of other witnesses. Keep your eyes peeled and identify the <textEffects>contradicting testimony</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
All right! Let's give this another shot, Nick! And make sure you don't forget to take a look at the <textEffects>Court Record</textEffects>, too!

That <textEffects>voice</textEffects>...belonged to you, Miss Kira. It could not have been anyone else.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And yet, in your testimony, you stated that you were in such shock during tonight's events that you <textEffects>couldn't even speak</textEffects>.

</line><line>Phoenix:
That man's character is beside the point! His testimony is anything but a "sham"! As he watched the flames erupt, his attention was drawn to a voice behind him, which in turn made him fall over.
</line><line>Layton:
He heard a woman's voice calling his name. ...A very concrete reason, and reason enough to believe his testimony.
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
If it is as you say, then explain why you feel this witness is somehow responsible!
</line><line>Kira:
Th-that's right! Why me? People barely hear me when I'm out selling my flowers...that's how soft my voice is! And besides, there WAS another woman at the scene, wasn't there?
</line><line>Mary:
M-me?! What are you getting at, young lady?! Do you honestly think a woman my age would be out late at night in the forest, flirting with questionable men? Besides, I didn't even know this pathetic man's name! How could I have called out to him?!
</line><line>Kira:
Neither did I! And even if I DID know his name, do you really think he's the kind of guy any self-respecting girl would want?!
</line><line>Emeer:
C'mon, ladies... I...I'm standin' right here, y'know...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Um, as I was saying! The only person that guy could've heard from "behind" him was you, Ms Kira!
</line><line>Layton:
The defence wishes to present evidence to prove this claim.
</line><line>Judge:
To accuse a witness like this young lady here... Why, this is simply unheard of! I must warn you, defender, if you cannot prove your accusation to this court, you will see the underside of my gavel! Show us the evidence proving this young lady was the one who called out to this man at the time of the crime!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Take a look at this and you'll have your answer.
</line><line>Judge:
This is...the crime scene sketch.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You can see the position of each witness during the crime. The only person that he could possibly have heard from behind him...was none other than Ms Kira!

</line><line>Emeer:
...*sniff*
</line><line>Barnham:
Did you, in fact, see this flower girl's face?
</line><line>Emeer:
Y-y'know, now that you mention it... Seein' as I'd fallen down an' all... I don't think I saw her face...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay...but you heard her voice, right?
</line><line>Emeer:
Hmm...lemme think... The voice came outta nowhere... It was kinda high-pitched... An' I guess it kinda sounded like her... But I can't say whether or not it was this girl's voice...
</line><line>Barnham:
And there you have it, Sir Blue Knight. ...Such a pity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-huh...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Milord! It is clear that the defence's claim is nothing but a pointless waste of the court's time. ...I recommend you deliver unto them a penalty befitting such behaviour.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... Indeed, Inquisitor. Ready yourself, defender!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">............ ...Heh heh heh heh...</captions>
<line>
Judge:
Wh-what is that laughter?
</line><line>Kira:
Pardon me, Milord...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
It looks like...you've finally arrived at a decision. That means this has nothing to do with me. Isn't that right, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
...What are you saying?
</line><line>Kira:
I'm saying...that it's time for me to stop peddling testimony and get back to peddling flowers. I mean, look at all of these flowers left over. It's going to take until sunrise to sell them all if I stay here any longer. Or maybe, Milord... You and the rest of the court would be interested in buying my entire stock of flowers to help a girl out...?
</line><line>Judge:
...Ah, no, I don't think... I mean...
</line><line>Kira:
Then it's settled. Now, if you'll excuse me. My apologies for the interruption.
</line><line>Judge:
U-understood. The court will dismiss the witness.
</line><line>Layton:
Well...Miss Kira. It would seem you are beginning to show the court your <textEffects>true colours</textEffects>.

...Now, that's funny. You say it isn't over, and yet the rest of the court seems to think otherwise. Isn't that right, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ ...The inquisition maintains that the real witch is the accused, Espella Cantabella. This girl...is nothing more than a <textEffects>witness</textEffects>. As such, the court cannot force her to stay against her will.

You really like throwing around accusations, don't you, Sir Defender?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
Let me spell it out for you one last time, so even you can understand. I didn't know this man's name at all before today. I still don't remember it.

</line><line>Layton:
One moment please, Miss Kira.
</line><line>Kira:
...Is there something else you wanted?
</line><line>Layton:
You don't seem to realise... what you just let slip.
</line><line>Kira:
...! What are you talking about?
</line><line>Layton:
This man testified that he heard his name called at the crime scene. However... you had no knowledge of his name at the time...is that correct?
</line><line>Kira:
That's right! This weirdo is just imagining things! Like I said, I've already forgotten his name, even though he told it to us earlier.
</line><line>Layton:
There is just one problem, Miss Kira. Namely, what the voice he heard tonight was actually saying.
</line><line>Kira:
Huh...?
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean? That's obvious. It was a <textEffects>name</textEffects>, wasn't it? Now, uhh...what was that name again?
</line><line>Emeer:
...Milord, I'm still here, y'know...
</line><line>Barnham:
...Y-you're saying that what this man heard tonight... wasn't a name, but rather...<textEffects>something else</textEffects> entirely?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed I am, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Something else</textEffects>"...)</span>
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...Ah ha!</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>(There's only one other thing it could be. It's a stretch, but the <span style="color:#E16935">possibility</textEffects> is there!)</span></captions>
<line>
Layton:
That's right, Mr Wright. That single possibility...is the <textEffects>key</textEffects> to solving this mystery.
</line><line>Judge:
...Is the defence ready to present its evidence to the court?
</line><line>Kira:
Ngh... This is ridiculous! I demand you let me go, this instant!
</line><line>Barnham:
...Witness, what you are being accused of is not to be taken lightly. You will not leave this courtroom so long as any reasonable doubt remains.
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Defender, you may present your evidence. Show the court what the voice this man heard tonight was really saying!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Excuse me, mister... Um... I'm sorry, what's your name again? You've, uh...got a name...that no one seems to be able to <textEffects>remember</textEffects> for some reason.
</line><line>Emeer:
Hey! It's <textEffects>Emeer</textEffects>! Me name's Emeer, darn it! How many times have I gotta say it?!
</line><line>Wordsmith:
No matter the number of times you say it, you do not look like an "Emeer".
</line><line>Kira:
Again, I only remember my most loyal customers' names, and he doesn't look like he could afford even a single daisy.
</line><line>Emeer:
C'mon guys... Stop kickin' a guy when he's down!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Mr Emeer. What you heard tonight at the crime scene was not your name. Your name just so happens to sound exactly like a certain <textEffects>other name</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Another...name...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The answer is right here in this tome. I'm talking about <textEffects>Amere</textEffects>...
</line><line>Judge:
A-A...mere?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What he actually heard at the time wasn't his own name... It was the name of a <textEffects>magical incantation</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what the...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira! Have you forgotten what you said just a few minutes ago? You quite clearly stated that you didn't know this man's name!
</line><line>Kira:
Ugh...

</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, let me get this straight! You're saying...that the "Amere" heard by the witness was actually said by this flower girl... and that it was not his name at all, but rather the incantation of a magic spell...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...The defence proposes the following: the true criminal, this supposed "witch", is not the defendant, Ms Espella Cantabella... but instead, the witness who was heard uttering the magic incantation...Ms Kira! She's our witch! You used magic to vanish from the scene and tried to frame Ms Cantabella instead!
</line><line>Kira:
... ...... ............ Noooooooooooooooo!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Wh-what just happened...?Is that girl... Is Espella really not a witch?U-unbelievable! I-I've never heard anything like this!I-Inquisitor Barnham...Have those two really defeated Inquisitor Barnham...?</captions>

</line><line>Barnham:
...An impressive display, Sir Blue Knight. It would seem you have finally managed to hone your blade. However...I believe that blade's edge is already beginning to dull.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Barnham:
I am referring to a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>, naturally.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(Hey, that's my line!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
...Milord, the inquisition would like to set the record straight regarding what transpired this evening.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, you claim the following: at the time of the crime, the accused, Espella Cantabella, was surrounded by the two rogues. Then, in order to frame the accused as a witch... Ms Kira cast the spell <textEffects>Dimere</textEffects> and made herself vanish. She then moved in closer to the victims... at which point she cast <textEffects>Ignaize</textEffects>. Thus causing the incident seen by our witnesses tonight.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed...that does seem to be the claim.
</line><line>Barnham:
The problem...is what happened next. There is a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> in the defence's account of Ms Kira's movements.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A contradiction...in her movements...?
</line><line>Barnham:
...Allow me to continue. The witnesses have stated that they each ventured out towards the crime scene. Which is when Ms Kira, the "witch", made her way to this point, while still invisible. When she arrived at said spot, she then cast <textEffects>Amere</textEffects> and reappeared to join the other witnesses. ...And there you have it. That is accurate, isn't it, Sir Blue Knight?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's correct. Then, Mr Emeer heard her call his "name".
</line><line>Barnham:
Well then, I have but one question that I would like you to answer: why would a witch need to do such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Supposing Ms Kira were a witch, surely she would not have made the <textEffects>conscious decision</textEffects> to reappear when she did. One would imagine she would remain hidden ...and <i>[sic]</i> flee the crime scene.
</line><line>Mary:
Qu-quite right! That's what I'd do if I was a witch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Given that point, there would be no viable reason for her to recite the incantation. In other words... it is inconceivable that this flower seller, Ms Kira, could be a witch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Wh-what just happened...?Is that girl... Is Kira really not a witch?I-Inquisitor Barnham just turned this entire trial right around!Just what I'd expect from Labyrinthia's Sword of Justice!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</captions>

</line><line>Kira:
...That's right. You all heard it. It's just as Inquisitor Barnham said. Me? A witch...? The idea is laughable!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(N-not good! She's completely bounced back on to her feet!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Oooooh... We were so close, too!
</line><line>Luke:
I...I can't believe Inquisitor Barnham! Can't he see it...? You just have to take one good look at her! It's obvious she's the real witch here!
</line><line>Layton:
Remember, Mr Wright: at times like this, a cool head will prevail.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mr Layton!
</line><line>Layton:
I'm sure you have had to fight your way out of circumstances such as these many times before. This situation is no different. As a defence attorney, what would you usually do at such a time...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What...would I usually do...? Of course... There's only one thing that can get me out of a situation like this... I've got to <span style="color:#E16935">flip</textEffects> this case on its head and think outside the box!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
...It would seem the defence has nothing further to add.
</line><line>Kira:
Why, of course. That's because everyone knows the truth. ...They know that girl right there is the real witch! That settles it, then! Go ahead and deliver your verdict, Milord!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
The situation is exactly as you described, Inquisitor Barnham. It really doesn't make much sense for the witch to have used Amere.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Regardless, the defence still maintains that Ms Kira did utter that incantation and make herself reappear... Now, the question is: for what <textEffects>reason</textEffects>? <textEffects>(If she really didn't have to use that spell, then why use it in the first place? If I can find the <span style="color:#E16935">answer</textEffects> to that question... then this entire case will start to unravel!)</span>
</line><line>Barnham:
...Most fascinating. Very well. Allow us to hear this theory of yours. Tell the court why it was necessary for the witch to appear at the crime scene!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Well, we're still in the game. Once you eliminate the impossible... whatever remains must be the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects>!)</span> The reason Ms Kira reappeared at the scene of the crime was...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't think of any other possibility... This has to be the answer.)</textEffects> Isn't it obvious? She was trying to cover up her own crime.
</line><line>Barnham:
Oh, is that right...? Tell me, why would she do that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-well, just give me a minute... I'm getting to that part!
</line><line>Barnham:
That will not be necessary, Sir Blue Knight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Barnham:
...Think about it. What would she have to hide... if no one could have seen her to begin with?
</line><line>Kira:
Heh...heh heh heh... You heard the good inquisitor! No matter how you look at it, there'd be no reason for me to reappear. ...Assuming I was the criminal, that is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Urgh! <textEffects>(I can't argue with her there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:

</line><line>Layton:
Pardon the interruption, but that's not necessarily the case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mr Layton!
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Explain yourself, Sir Top Hat.
</line><line>Layton:
You have stated that Miss Kira had <textEffects>no reason</textEffects> to reappear. However...the situation changed and it became <textEffects>necessary</textEffects> for her to show herself. Isn't that right, Miss Kira?
</line><line>Kira:
...Huh...?! Wh-wh-wh-wh-what're you talking about?! I-I-I-I have no idea what you mean!
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem...the defence must clarify their argument with evidence.
</line><line>Layton:
...Mr Wright. I believe that Miss Kira did not intend to reveal herself at the crime scene. Rather, that <textEffects>something</textEffects> occurred which forced this young lady to make herself reappear.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What was so important that she had to <span style="color:#E16935">reappear</textEffects> and risk being spotted...?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
...Defender. Tell the court why it would have been necessary for the witch to appear at the crime scene!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms Kira, you usually wear <textEffects>glasses</textEffects>, is that correct?
</line><line>Kira:
Huh...?! I-it's like I already told you. I lost my glasses a few days ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you <textEffects>absolutely sure</textEffects> about that? Or did you not, in fact, lose them tonight? ...During <textEffects>the crime</textEffects>?
</line><line>Kira:
...! O-of...course not!
</line><line>Layton:
Perhaps you accidentally dropped them while you were committing the crime... Then, as you were attempting to make your escape, you noticed they were gone. Therefore, you made yourself reappear... in order to search for your missing glasses!
</line><line>Kira:
Noooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
...How absurd! Such baseless conjecture! What you propose is fundamentally flawed!
</line><line>Layton:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Barnham:
...Let us assume, hypothetically, that the witch did in fact drop this "evidence". That does not explain what purpose it would serve for her to make herself reappear! It would still make more sense for her to escape under cover of darkness!

</line><line>Layton:
Unfortunately, Inquisitor Barnham... such a plan was simply not possible.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what...?!
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, do you understand what I'm suggesting?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes! <textEffects>(He means the</textEffects> <textEffects>reason</textEffects> <textEffects>Ms Kira made herself reappear at the crime scene... Okay, this is it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Defender! Enlighten us... Why did the witness feel the need to make herself reappear?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The answer is simple, Your Honour... she <textEffects>couldn't find</textEffects> her glasses!
</line><line>Barnham:
She...could not find them...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you've noticed, she's still not wearing her glasses right now.
</line><line>Kira:
...Nghh!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Kira:
Th-that's right! It doesn't change a single thing!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
That's where you're wrong. In fact...it changes things quite a bit.
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Tonight, the two victims were engulfed by flames, courtesy of a magic spell. That very instant, four witnesses saw the flames erupt at the scene. It was at that point... That something you <textEffects>didn't expect</textEffects> occurred: you suddenly lost your glasses.
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. You were scared that if your glasses were discovered at the scene of the crime... you would be suspected of being a witch!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid that is not a possibility, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what did you say...?!
</line><line>Layton:
If you recall, it had been raining quite heavily at the crime scene beforehand. Had she stated that she dropped her glasses before the crime, then naturally... one would expect the glasses to be soaked in water and covered in mud. However, the rain had already stopped at the time the crime itself was committed. In other words... One look at the clean, dry glasses would reveal she had dropped them later... Thus implicating her as the witch!
</line><line>Kira:
...Nooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Knightle:
I should have known... I was perfecting my "Rainfall Rending" technique in the forest... and not once during the rainfall did I see that flower maiden travelling along the nearby path!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's not all! In order to frame Ms Cantabella as the witch... you needed to leave this <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects> behind at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
I-I see! That would be the most definitive <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that she is the witch...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The objective here...was to have somebody else discover the staff at the scene.
</line><line>Wordsmith:
Alas, that person was I!
</line><line>Layton:
However... No doubt you came to realise that one can deduce which spells were used simply by examining the magic gems on the sceptre. In this case, one can see that the "witch" must have used Dimere to vanish from sight and make her escape.
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's why, Ms Kira... you were left with no option but to reappear at the crime scene. That was the only way for you to avoid suspicion if someone were to discover your glasses at the crime scene! By reappearing, you'd be able to explain that you simply dropped your glasses when you rushed to see what had happened!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">What do you have to say to that, Ms Kira?</captions>
<line>
Kira:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...... ...... You know... I've let you both ramble on and onnn... But...playtime is over.</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Kira:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">So? So that's...it, then? I'm a witch because I dropped my glasses? I must have said it...how many times now? I lost my glasses days ago... Were you even listening? I'll say it again. Over a <textEffects>MILLION times</textEffects>! "I lost my glasses! I lost my glasses!" Do you LIKE evidence, Sir Defender? Do you LOVE proof, Sir Top Hat?! Then, PROVE <textEffects>I dropped my glasses</textEffects> at the crime scene! Ha! You CAN'T <textEffects>prove</textEffects> it! In. Other. Words. You lose.</captions>

Phoenix:

<captions aligned="center">............</captions>

Judge:
Th-that is correct... Proving such a thing...would indeed be impossible. To prove that the witness...dropped her glasses at the crime scene... ...What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ 'Tis indeed a question of proof, Milord. These glasses have been missing from the very beginning. The Knights of the Inquisition...found no trace of these glasses anywhere near the crime scene. Therefore... this witness cannot, in any way, be accused of being a witch!
</line><line>Kira:
You heard the man.
</line><line>Maya:
B-but! We were so close!
</line><line>Luke:
That girl is a witch! Can't anyone else see that?! What should we do, Professor?! ...Ah.
</line><line>Layton:
...Well, it would seem the young lady has finished what she had to say, wouldn't you agree, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes. It certainly looks that way, Mr Layton.
</line><line>Kira:
What the...? What's with that face? D-do you find something funny here?!
</line><line>Layton:
...It is as you said, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
E-explain...
</line><line>Layton:
The defence raises just one further question. Why were you unable to find those glasses?
</line><line>Kira:
I... What do you mean...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You must have searched the area quite thoroughly looking for them. And yet, even now the knights have been unable to locate those glasses. Did you ever wonder why?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that has become quite the mystery! Surely they must be around somewhere...
</line><line>Barnham:
The glasses were lost to the wolves. That is the only explanation!
</line><line>Layton:
...There is still <textEffects>one remaining place</textEffects> that you have not searched tonight.
</line><line>Kira:
Huh...? Wh-what did you say...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The glasses were supposedly not found at the crime scene... Leaving only one other possible <textEffects>place</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what is this...? You two... Have at you, Sir Blue Knight! Draw your blade, and reveal to the court <textEffects>where</textEffects> the glasses are supposedly hiding!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It looks like I've somehow managed to make it through my first witch trial... It all comes down to this... The final piece of evidence... Time to clear up this case once and for all!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
I leave the rest in your capable hands, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The piece of evidence pointing to the one place <textEffects>not searched</textEffects> tonight is...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Tonight... there was <textEffects>one thing</textEffects> that was carried away from the crime scene right under everyone's noses.
</line><line>Kira:
C-<textEffects>carried away</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I am speaking, of course, about this.
</line><line>Kira:
...Ah!
</line><line>Barnham:
That's...the <textEffects>milk bucket</textEffects> that disappeared from the crime scene!
</line><line>Layton:
Thus far, the defence's claim that the glasses were dropped at the crime scene has been regarded as <textEffects>mere speculation</textEffects>. ...However. If, Miss Kira, we find your glasses within the contents of this milk bucket... then our "<textEffects>mere speculation</textEffects>" will suddenly become <textEffects>fact</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what manner of witchery...?
</line><line>Kira:
...What are you TALKING about?! Y-you're crazy! Just...crazy! N-no way could my glasses be inside that stupid bucket! That's just impossible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
How about we quit with the speculation and actually find out...? What do you say, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Kira:
Th-that'll just waste the court's time! D-don't listen to them! Don't...
</line><line>Barnham:
............ 'Tis mandated...that the Knights of the Inquisition investigate any and all possibilities during the course of a trial.
</line><line>Kira:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Milord! The inquisition requests that this milk bucket be searched immediately!
</line><line>Judge:
...V-very well! ...... ......... ............ Oh! Wh-what... WHAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ms Kira. As you can see, your glasses have been found inside the milk bucket. The truth is out. Nothing you say can change that now.
</line><line>Layton:
Which leads us to the next question... Specifically, a question of when. When did you drop your glasses into the milk bucket...?
</line><line>Barnham:
...! Wh-what...?
</line><line>Kira:
Wh-why is this happening?! This whole thing is ridiculous! Th-the answer is obvious, isn't it?! I dropped them <textEffects>afterwards</textEffects>! After I ran over to see the fire... I took a tiny peek inside that milk bucket! That's when they fell in...

</line><line>Mary:
...Don't be stupid, child. Snowy and I were at the scene first. We made sure to take that milk bucket before anyone else could get their grubby little hands on it. We weren't going to let a single soul get anywhere near that sweet, creamy bucket of deliciousness! You can bet my farm on that!
</line><line>Kira:
...Ngh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Each of these four witnesses has stated they heard the spell Ignaize being cast at the time of the incident. According to the Grand Grimoire... Ignaize "summons a circle of flame within a <textEffects>1 metre</textEffects> radius of the caster". In other words... the real witch must have been at <textEffects>Ms Cantabella's side</textEffects> at the time of the incident.
</line><line>Layton:
...Indeed. That is when the glasses fell into the milk bucket. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion. Only one person who could be the true witch.
</line><line>Kira:
...Ngh... Nghhh...Nghhh...
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Ms Kira! You are the real witch!</captions>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
What a very strange trial this has been... From the very beginning, we have all paid witness to an unusual set of circumstances. A baker turned defender, a surprise extra witness...and now, a "not guilty" verdict for the accused... Never have I seen such a spectacle!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...............I-is this really happening...?The girl inside the cage... You mean she's...the real witch...?But... What about that Espella Cantabella girl...?</captions>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
...Ms Kira.
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Tell us WHY... Why were you trying to frame Ms Cantabella?
</line><line>Kira:
............
</line><line>Layton:
You could easily have escaped the crime scene without a trace. There was no reason to frame anyone... This crime was a result of nothing but your overwhelming <textEffects>ill intent</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
To frame a person as a witch... is to condemn that person to death by fire. Surely you must know this... so why Espella Cantabella?
</line><line>Kira:
............ Do you have any idea what it feels like to be a witch?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(What it..."<span style="color:#E16935">feels like</textEffects>"...?)</span>
</line><line>Kira:
...I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask for these powers, but I have them. And now, here I am... Begging for my life... I was living such a peaceful life until now. Selling flowers, getting scolded by my boss for not selling enough of them... That's why I was trying to put an end to these trials once and for all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Put an end</textEffects> to the trials?
</line><line>Kira:
You all know what I mean! The one <textEffects>condition</textEffects> written in the Story that will end these witch trials!
</line><line>Judge:
When the Great Witch <textEffects>Bezella</textEffects> has been put to the flames and vanquished from this world, these trials will come to an end...
</line><line>Kira:
This was my chance to finally end all this. ...At least, that's what I thought. The sun had begun to set on that lonely forest path, and there wasn't a soul in sight. I always carried my hidden Talea Magica with me in case of a moment like this... I used my magic to expose that girl for what she really is! If I had been successful... then all these trials would finally end and I could go on living my peaceful life...
</line><line>Judge:
...What-what-what are you saying...?! A-am I hearing this correctly...? Are you actually accusing Espella Cantabella...?
</line><line>Kira:
Why do you think no one has ever seen <textEffects>the legendary Great Witch</textEffects>? It's because she's been hidden in our midst the entire time! She's protected! She's hidden from us! It's all part of the Story!
</line><line>Judge:
P-part of the Story...?
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
...That's enough! Speak no more. A witch's existence cannot be justified.
</line><line>Kira:
No! Please! I know you've all noticed it too! You could end this! All of this! That girl... It's all because of that girl... I beg you, please! She's... Please release me! Knights of the Court, isn't it your duty to protect the people of this town?! Give me another chance!
</line><line>Barnham:
...That is where you're wrong.
</line><line>Kira:
Huh...?
</line><line>Barnham:
'Tis indeed a knight's duty to protect... We are impelled to protect the citizens of Labyrinthia...against you and your ilk! The reason you were offered my protection until now was because your guilt was uncertain. There was the possibility that you were not a witch... The circumstances were such that it seemed another was guilty. That possibility has since disappeared and your innocence along with it. You now find yourself at the other end of my sword.
</line><line>Kira:
N-no...
</line><line>Barnham:
Vile witch, enemy of Labyrinthia! May the fires purge you from this land!
</line><line>Espella:

</line><line>Espella:
Please, wait! Stop...please just stop this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Espella!
</line><line>Espella:
If...if it means putting an end to these horrible trials... Let me take her place! Let me be <textEffects>Bezella</textEffects>! Send me to the flames! P-please... If it would save her lif-
</line><line>Judge:
This trial has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this flower seller, Kira, is a witch. And according to the law, all those found to be witches will be <textEffects>executed</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-did he say "executed"? He can't mean...
</line><line>Layton:
This is most unsettling!
</line><line>Judge:
...Bailiff! Ready the fire!
</line><line>Espella:
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
</line>

<line><i>Anime cutscene</i>
Layton:
No!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! Don't do this!
</line><line>Kira:
Listen to me! Don't let her fool you! Espella is the Great Witch! Hear me! There's no time to waste! She's Bezella! Take her... and then these witch trials... will be no more! The witch trials will end-

<hr />
<line><i>Waiting Hall</i>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So far we've always managed to pull off a win and get a "not guilty" verdict, but... winning has never felt this depressing...)</textEffects> ...Oh, Espella! Are you all right?
</line><line>Espella:
Yes. I just... I just want to thank all of you. You all came to my rescue yet again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Well, yeah. Of course we did.
</line><line>Maya:
H-hold on a sec', Espella! What...did you say just now? "You all came to my rescue yet again"... You don't mean...?
</line><line>Espella:
Yes. I...remember everything. I remember the last trial... I suppose that makes this the second time we've met...and the second time all of you have helped me.
</line><line>Layton:
...! Mr Wright, am I to infer that you and Espella have met before?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah... Yeah, it seems that way. You too, Mr Layton?
</line><line>Layton:
...Hmm. Perhaps it would be best if we briefed each other on what has transpired.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay, what should we discuss...?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Espella:
I had a lot of time to think while I was on that ship. I thought about a lot of things... Like how to try and find a way back once the ship arrived at its destination. Things like that...
</line><line>Maya:
"<textEffects>Find a way back</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Espella:
A way back to Mr Layton and Luke... They were the only ones I knew I could depend on to help me.
</line><line>Layton:
...The pleasure was ours, Espella.
</line><line>Espella:
But...no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember the name of the town where they lived.
</line><line>Luke:
Huh?! You mean London, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
Oh! That's it! "London"! That's what was written in Carmine's letter to Mr Layton. ...The blue teddy bear I found in that room was wearing a tag around its neck.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sorry, Espella...but PC Badger looks nothing like a teddy bear.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
On the tag, in very small letters, was written "London"! I recognised the name of the town... I thought it might be an address.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's because that stuffed toy was used in a special promotion, run by the London Metropolitan Police.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, that's right! Espella, you must have known that address was super important, so that's why you kept the tag, right? That way you could meet up with Mr Layton and Luke again.
</line><line>Espella:
I just...felt so lonely and helpless...
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Maya:
I wonder, though... Who do you think really did it? Hit Olivia over the head with a pipe, I mean...
</line><line>Layton:
...What's this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, yeah...I guess we never did find out who the real culprit was...
</line><line>Layton:
............ I do believe that may have some connection to the group of witches.
</line><line>Espella:
What?! You mean, the witches that were chasing us through London?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. It could be that they noticed your escape on to that ship and managed to infiltrate their own way aboard.
</line><line>Espella:
C-could it be...?
</line><line>Maya:
Soooo...you're saying there was some big, scary witch lurking around the inside of that cargo hold?!
</line><line>Layton:
...I'm afraid there is a rather high possibility that was the case. Those witches were intent on seeing you brought back to Labyrinthia, no matter what. However, in order to do so, they had to make certain you did not become entangled in any situation that may stall your capture.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah... In other words, the situation with Ms Aldente, you mean?
</line><line>Layton:
...Precisely. They must have knocked that crew member unconscious and attempted to recapture Espella before the police could arrive. However, their plan was clearly foiled, given that you ended up in court regardless. ............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And that's when she became my client...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
I...I just can't clearly remember anything that happened back then.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you think there's a possibility that someone was pulling Espella's strings through the entire trial?
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, maybe you're right... There was something a little strange about Espella at the time.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright. Espella was introduced to you at the time as a schoolgirl, is that correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes.
</line><line>Layton:
She would have had no knowledge of the world outside of Labyrinthia. That being the case, having her stand in an English courtroom as she was would pose a serious problem... Meaning that someone must have been attempting to cover up Espella's identity.
</line><line>Luke:
What?! But, Professor...could someone really do that?
</line><line>Layton:
That they could indeed, Luke. And if it is as I suspect... I believe our adversaries may be far more powerful than we originally thought.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Just exactly who, or what, are we dealing with here...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Hey, guys! Let's head back to the bakery for now! I bet the boss is waiting for us with one heck of a pastry feast!
</line><line>Espella:
Oh... Actually, I... I can't go home just yet.
</line><line>Luke:
Huh?! You can't? Aww...
</line><line>Espella:
Well, there are still a couple of legal procedures to be taken care of before I can go home. Please, you all go on ahead without me.
</line><line>Layton:
...Is that so? Very well.
</line><line>Espella:
I really must thank you all. Thank you so much for everything.
</line><line>Maya:
All righty then, Espella! We'll catch you later!
</line><line>Espella:
Yes. Farewell for now.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
Mr Wright, please allow me the pleasure of a proper introduction. My name is Hershel Layton. I am a professor of archaeology in London.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A...a professor...? Huh... Well, my name is Phoenix Wright. I'm an attorney.
</line><line>Layton:
As I suspected, you were no ordinary baker after all, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah...I thought it was pretty weird myself, to be honest. I mean, I really did believe I'd been a baker all my life... But the more everyone kept saying it, the less sure I was that it was actually true. <textEffects>(Just where did that memory come from, anyway...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Luke:
Hey, Professor... If Mr Wright is an attorney, that must mean he's as <textEffects>smart</textEffects> as you, right?
</line><line>Layton:
Ha ha. I'm afraid I can't really say, Luke.
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm...buuuuuut... Behind every ace attorney there's an even smarter - not to mention beautiful, witty and utterly amazing - <textEffects>ace assistant</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I think you also forgot humble.
</line><line>Luke:
My name's Luke Triton. I'm the professor's apprentice!
</line><line>Maya:
I'm Maya Fey. And Nick here is my apprentice! Isn't that right, Nicky-boy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Nicky-boy"...? Hey, wait! Why am I YOUR apprentice?!
</line><line>Maya:
Anyway, we should all head back to the bakery. Let's get a move on!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure Espella will be back before we know it!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...I would not get your hopes up about that, Sir Blue Knight.</captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
I-Inquisitor Barnham!
</line><line>Barnham:
Most impressive work tonight... 'Tis a shame you have kept such ability hidden until now.
</line><line>Maya:
Trust me, Nick's lawyer abilities beat the pants off his baking abilities any day of the week.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, moving on! What do you mean by that, Inquisitor? Why can't Espella go home?!
</line><line>Barnham:
New charges have been brought against Ms Espella Cantabella.
</line><line>Luke:
What?! N-no way... That can't be right!
</line><line>Barnham:
You have realised it, haven't you? She is being charged under suspicion of being the <textEffects>Great Witch Bezella</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sh-she what...?!
</line><line>Layton:
How can that be? Am I to assume that charge is based purely on Miss Kira's accusation?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ It was not I who made the decision...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Regardless... the girl will return to court at the appointed time for further trial. Until then, I am to seek out any and all evidence pertaining to the Great Witch.
</line><line>Layton:
Pardon me, Inquisitor. When exactly is this <textEffects>appointed time</textEffects>?
</line><line>Barnham:
...The investigation into this allegation will conclude on the day of the Storyteller's next <textEffects>parade</textEffects>. That would be...two weeks from today. Following our investigations into the matter, the <textEffects>trial of the Great Witch</textEffects> shall proceed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-what the...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
It would appear the girl has been withholding a dark secret from you all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Espella...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Espella Cantabella's questioning is set to begin shortly. That means visiting hours are over... I recommend you leave immediately.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Espella? The legendary Great Witch <span style="color:#E16935">Bezella</textEffects>...?)</span>
</line><line>Layton:
The Story that dictates the fate of an entire town...and now a so-called "Great Witch" named Bezella... Most intriguing. It would seem to be up to us to uncover the answers to these mysteries.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But how are we supposed to manage it all in two weeks? Where are we going to find any evidence?!
</line><line>Maya:
Hm... Y'know, I was thinking... How do you address a Great Witch...? "Hail to thee, oh magnificent magical one!" Or maybe just: "Wassup, witchy baby?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
What difference would it make? She's called a "great witch"! That's not someone I'd ever wanna meet!
</line><line>Layton:
............ I believe I've thought of a solution to our problem. It's actually rather simple.
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Professor Layton?
</line><line>Layton:
Allow me to explain, Mr Wright. The only way we may be able to solve the mysteries of this town and its residents is if we join forces.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(...He's right. We've come this far... There's no way we're just going to give up on Espella!)</textEffects> Okay, I'm on board. I look forward to teaming up with you, Professor.
</line><line>Maya:
Me too, Luke!
</line><line>Luke:
Um...m-me too, Maya!
</line><line>Layton:
Now then, shall we press on? This marks the beginning of our own story... one dictated by ourselves and written by our own hands.
