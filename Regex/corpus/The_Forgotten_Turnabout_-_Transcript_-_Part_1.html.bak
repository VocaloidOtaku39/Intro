<line>Edgeworth:
Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A decision has not yet been made.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Courtney said!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He was... actually imagining it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
We're busy right now! Come back later, pal!
</line><line>???:
Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal!
</line><line>???:
Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so...
</line><line>???:
I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Who might you be?
</line><line>Karin:
Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room.
</line><line>Karin:
Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me!
</line><line>Karin:
Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is that supposed to mean?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think?
</line><line>???:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do I think...?
</line><line>???:
Umm... Do you not recognize me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course not!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth".
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Umm. Th-That's true...
</line><line>???:
I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well...
</line><line>Karin:
The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M... Memory loooosss?
</line><line>???:
Yes... That seems to be the case.
</line><line>Karin:
Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Isn't that plenty of sleep?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least.
</line><line>???:
Would you... really do that for me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Good grief...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Miss. Do you remember your name?
</line><line>???:
My name...... I am terribly sorry.
</line><line>Karin:
She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm. So you found her yesterday.
</line><line>Karin:
Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wh... What a tiresome woman...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her?
</line><line>Karin:
Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha... Th-This badge is...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you Kay!?
</line><line>???:
Kay......?

<line>Kay:
...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. Well, that's... <textEffects>(Rather difficult to explain.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The last time I met "Kay" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?)</textEffects> Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her?
</line><line>Karin:
She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't mind. Please show them to me.
</line><line>Karin:
Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women.
</line><line>Karin:
Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'll have to look them over in more detail later.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Look at this ticket stub.
</line><line>Karin:
Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Grand Tower!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Grand Tower?
</line><line>Karin:
Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ehh! Right now, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-But... What about the P.I.C.!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's still too early for me to be summoned there.
</line><line>Karin:
Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right?
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much!
</line><line>Karin:
Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. I understand. <textEffects>(I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.)</textEffects> Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yessir!
</line><line>Kay:
Thank you... for helping me.

<line>Gumshoe:
Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Good. Thank you.
</line><line><textEffects>Grand Tower Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well then, let us head inside immediately...
</line><line>Eeeek! The Grand Tower... The Grand Tower is collapsing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>???:
No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Grand Tower!?
</line><line>Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut!
</line><line>???:
E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Hmph. I suspected as much.)</textEffects> We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something...
</line><line>???:
Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break.
</line><line>???:
I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry!
</line><line>Kay:
What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...)</textEffects> Well then. We should get going.

<line>Gumshoe:
Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here!
</line><line>Kay:
Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's not as if she's a kite!)</textEffects> Kay, do you recognize this place?
</line><line>Kay:
...I-I don't know. Was I... really here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...)</textEffects> Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do.
</line><line>Kay:
O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Memories of the Tower --</textEffects></center>
<line>Kay:
Did I... really come to a place like this?
It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening.
...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...
.....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh?
</line><line>Kay:
...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...You're not helping, Detective.)</textEffects>

<line>Kay:
<textEffects>...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...</textEffects>

<line>Kay:
<textEffects>But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kay:
<textEffects>Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Kay:
<textEffects>.....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand... ...and walked directly towards you.
</line><line>Kay:
Yes. Someone came right up to me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then that "someone" must have been a ghost.
</line><line>Kay:
No, it was a person! I'm sure of it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If this is where you were under the cherry tree, then someone behind the stand... ...wouldn't have any ground to stand on. They'd be floating in midair! No person should be able to stand there!
</line><line>Kay:
Eeeeek!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
But... I... I'm not lying! Someone... red... Someone in red... was on the other side of the stand... They were walking towards me... Ahh... Getting closer and closer, and then... ...that person... that person... AAAAAAAAAHHHH!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What's wrong!? Calm down! It's alright! Me and Mr. Edgeworth are both here for you, pal!
</line><line>Kay:
I-I... I was... pushed off. That person... in red... Yes, they were wearing a red raincoat...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Someone in a red raincoat was walking in midair? And furthermore, they pushed her off this building? Nonsense. There is no way she could be alright after falling from a building this high!)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Kay's memories jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Officer:
Attention, everyone! Please remain where you are!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? I'm a detective! Tell me what's going on!
</line><line>Officer:
Sir! A body was just discovered in this building!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A-A body!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who is the victim!?
</line><line>Officer:
We're currently investigating the details, but the victim is a woman! We have verified that her name is "Kay"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAAAT!?

<textEffects>(Th-This room is...!)</textEffects> Would this room happen to be...
</line><line>Officer:
Yes, sir! It's the <textEffects>Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's meeting room</textEffects>!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaat! It's here!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I had heard they recently moved out of the Prosecutor's Building. <textEffects>(But to think that they moved here of all places...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Grand Tower Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Mr. Edgeworth! Kay! What brings you here? How are you holding up?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We're in the middle of an investigation right now. Sorry, but who might this be?
</line><line>Karin:
Ah! This is my Granny! Errm, let me just... "Hi there sonny, the name's Bonnie Young. Who the heck are you?" ...she says.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. Ms. Jenson, isn't Young the name of...
</line><line>Karin:
*ahem!* Granny is the director of the Dye-Young Hospital!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This old lady... is the director?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
"Who're you callin' old!" ...she says.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Sh-She can read my thoughts?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh! So that Granny is pretty important, huh?
</line><line>Karin:
Ah ha ha! I wouldn't go that far... I mean, yes, she is. Aah, these people are... the patient's guardians. Y'know, the one with amnesia...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm. It seems she is a bit of an introvert.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
"Hey sonny, want me to cure that bad case of the frownies for you?" ...she says.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! I'm afraid that's an incurable disease for Mr. Edgeworth, pal!
</line><line>Karin:
Eh? Really, Granny? You want me to say that... "I ain't got nothin' to say to you whippersnappers! You're free to do whatever you want. But you better not get in the way of my autopsy."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please wait. We're...
</line><line>Karin:
"No means no!"
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey, you don't have the right to decide that, pal!
</line><line>Karin:
S-Sorry! Granny is the coroner, you see. And she's in charge of this case, so... Ouch! So, I'm very sorry, but that's the way it is.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaddaya mean, "that's the way it is," pal!?
</line><line>Karin:
Well... Even if you ask me, I'm not the one who said it.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I kinda feel like..... I'm watching a comedy act, sir.
</line><line>Karin:
Well, we need to get back to the autopsy, so please excuse us! And take care!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What was with her attitude!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We received permission to investigate. There shouldn't be any problems.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That atittude of hers is a huge problem, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...? What do we do now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We'll investigate the scene, of course. As a prosecutor, I cannot stand by and do nothing.
</line><line>Kay:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well then, let's begin.
</line><line>Kay:
But, the policeman said the dead person is also named "Kay"... Then, I'm pretty sure I'm not the Kay that you know, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We shall investigate that now. But... don't worry. There's no question that you are the Kay I know.
</line><line>Kay:
.....OK!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(An amnesiac Kay, and a corpse Kay... Both are connected to the Grand Tower. I'm certain that this case will lead me to Kay's lost memories!)</textEffects>

<line><i>(Examining bloodstain and talking to the officer leads to:)</i>
</line><line>???:
Excuse me.
</line><line>Karin:
You are...? Oh, yes, what is it? "That voice... It's Von Karma, right?" Umm... Do you know her, Granny?
</line><line>???:
Good to see you again, Doctor. And you as well, Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh... <textEffects>(What is she doing here!? Franziska von Karma... She is a prosecutor working with Interpol, and the daughter of Manfred von Karma. She should be jetting around the world right now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Wherever there is a case, I will follow. National borders mean nothing before me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your presence here must mean that this case has international significance...
</line><line>Franziska:
You know well enough that I'm chasing a smuggling ring. I shall recover all the stolen goods and crush that organization!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then... does that mean the smuggling ring is also involved in this particular case?
</line><line>Franziska:
...Any further information is confidential. I am not obligated to speak of it with you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! <textEffects>(So, it won't be that easy...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Umm, Ms. Franziska... von Karma? Granny says... "The autopsy is complete. You're free to do what you want."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, we would like to investigate as well.
</line><line>Karin:
"I've heard rumors about you! No way am I letting you near the body! You're the prosecutor who's about to get the boot. You best run on home now, sonny!" Er, umm, just so you know, I wasn't the one who said that, OK?
</line><line>Kay:
P-Please, Granny. We need to investigate... No matter what.
</line><line>Karin:
"Hey, lassie! Who you callin' Granny!?"
</line><line>Kay:
Eeek...! I-I'm sorry!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(We're not getting anywhere... I guess I have no other choice.)</textEffects> Franziska, please allow us to aid you in your investigation. We must examine that body in order to find out what happened to Kay!
</line><line>Franziska:
To Kay Faraday...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I'm asking you too, sir! Kay's in really bad shape!
</line><line>Franziska:
......... I don't know what's going on... ...but fine, I'll grant you permission.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! You have my thanks.
</line><line>Franziska:
Of course, I didn't say it would come without a price. You will explain everything to me later.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
We really owe you one, sir!
</line><line>Franziska:
I wasn't talking to you, Scruffy!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
YEEEEOOWCH!
</line><line>Franziska:
So that's how it is. If you would be so kind as to authorize them too, Doctor?
</line><line>Karin:
"I suppose it's fine if he's with a prosecutor from Interpol." ...Is what she says. And I fully agree with Granny.
</line><line>Franziska:
By the Von Karma name, the entire world will be judged... That's just common knowledge.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's rather conceited for common knowledge...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
"Well, it's none of my beeswax anymore." ...Is what she says. Um, I hope you don't get in trouble for this.
</line><line>Franziska:
You needn't worry. My reputation will not be shaken by something so petty.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

The purple flower Kay had with her... I wonder if that originally belonged to the victim.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Now that you mention it... The cloth does look the same as the one on the pin!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Let's compare them without delay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's a perfect match, sir! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line><textEffects>Purple Flower data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The fact that this flower belongs to the victim means...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
That can only mean that Kay Faraday came in contact with the victim. And about that corsage, it looks like it was forcibly ripped off. There is a possibility that Kay Faraday is connected to this case. And depending on the situation... ...we may have to consider her as a suspect.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What did you saaaaaaaay!? There's no way she did it! It's unthinkable! Kay could never do that, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(However, it's true we have no evidence to deny that claim.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
.........
</line><line>Franziska:
It's nothing more than a possibility at the moment. Isn't that right, Miles Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Indeed. For better or for worse.

<line>Edgeworth:
So, the victim's identity remains unknown...
</line><line>Kay:
Umm... Should you really still be calling "Kay"?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Of course! What are you saying, pal!?
</line><line>Kay:
Th-Thank you. But then, what about that woman...?
</line><line>Franziska:
She is someone who you may have killed. That's all we know.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
There's no way that's true! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... also do not believe you killed her.
</line><line>Franziska:
You are such a naïve man, Miles Edgeworth.

♬ Here I come to save the dayyy!

<textEffects>(Hmm, that voice...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
♬ So don't be afraid anymooore! For The Best Prosecutor is here todayyy! ♪
</line><line>Courtney:
Pardon the interruption.
</line><line>Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Get away from the victim! I have inherited her dying wish! No one asked for YOU!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. Did you know the victim?
</line><line>Courtney:
Just as I thought... The Goddess of Law will surely reveal the truth to us. So please, rest in peace.
</line><line>Debeste:
That's right, Justine! Now that I'm here, everything will be A-OK. The culprit will rue the day he crossed paths with MYARGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Who is this fool of a man!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wh-Why is she glaring at me!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
You are Franziska von Karma, am I correct? I apologize for my late introduction. I am Justine Courtney. And the deceased individual is...
</line><line>Debeste:
...Attorney Jill Crane, one of the members of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I see. So that's why she had the keycard...)</textEffects> I take it you're in charge of this case?
</line><line>Debeste:
That's right! And with me in charge, this case is as good as solv- YEOOOWW!
</line><line>Franziska:
That reminds me... I haven't caught your name yet.
</line><line>Debeste:
If you just wanted to know my name, you didn't have to whi- YEAAAARGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
Just state your name. I will not tolerate any unnecessary remarks.
</line><line>Debeste:
Uuugh... Sebastian Debeste.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems the pecking order has been decided.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
Mr. Sebastian Debeste? Here, this is from Granny.
</line><line>Debeste:
This is... the autopsy report! Wah hah hah... It seems you've been bested, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This wasn't a competition to begin with...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karin:
"My job is done. May we meet again in front of another corpse." OK, let's go home quickly, and eat some noodles! I'll be leaving too! Take care everyone!
</line><line>Debeste:
...The victim's head wound was postmortem.
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian.
</line><line>Debeste:
And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Justine?
</line><line>Courtney:
While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That would be painful indeed...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Anyways, it's quite clear now! Kay Faraday must be arrested!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat! What's the big idea, pal!?
</line><line>Courtney:
It's just as he says, Detective. The culprit is Ms. Kay Faraday. The young lady in bandages over there... Although she's not wearing her usual attire... Are you not Ms. Kay Faraday?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..... And what would you do if she is Kay? If you're going to arrest her... ...then I will resist by any means necessary. ...That, I guarantee you.
</line><line>Courtney:
I am now convinced. The doubts surrounding your suitability as a prosecutor were indeed warranted.
</line><line>Kay:
It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth. You can go. Don't worry about me... I'll be fine.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What are you saying, Kay!? You can't just go along with them, pal!
</line><line>Kay:
But, I... I don't remember anything. What if I really did kill that woman and then forgot about it? If that's true...
</line><line>Courtney:
Acknowledgement is the Goddess' mercy. Atonement is her will. The Goddess of Law will surely praise you for your prudence!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sebastian. And Judge Courtney... If you believe she is the culprit, on what basis do you make your accusations? Unless I'm completely convinced by your explanation... I will not obey your orders!
</line><line>Debeste:
Fine, have it your way! Now, sit tight and listen to the perfect reasoning of Debeste!

<line>Debeste:
I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do.
Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit!
She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something.
In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
His logic's as awful as ever, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Harsh words... coming from you, Detective.)</textEffects> I asked for some basis to your claims, yet your reasoning has told me absolutely nothing...
</line><line>Franziska:
...However, we have no evidence to prove she didn't do it either.
</line><line>Kay:
........
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't worry, Kay. I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth will pull off a miracle.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Y-You think my deductions are some kind of miracle work...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
You'd better not disappoint me. Understand, Miles Edgeworth? Because if you do... this whip of mine won't stay silent.

Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone.
</line><line>Kay:
It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room.
</line><line>Debeste:
<textEffects>The Best</textEffects> man for the job should know all about <textEffects>The Best</textEffects> places.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, it seems that you are not <textEffects>The Best</textEffects> man for the job.
</line><line>Debeste:
Are you mocking me!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's for you to decide. You didn't even know about this keycard, did you?
</line><line>Debeste:
Of course I know about that! You need it to enter this room... ......... Huh? Was it really needed?
</line><line>Franziska:
This foolish fool simply doesn't know when to give up!
</line><line>Debeste:
YEEEOOOOOOWCH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sebastian, do you really suspect Kay?
</line><line>Debeste:
Th-That's right! She's the only one who could have done it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well then, allow me to ask you... Since this room can only be entered by using a keycard... ...hoe did she enter the room without one!?
</line><line>Debeste:
Gah...! W-Well, she probably used this and that, and... Nngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? Did you pull a muscle? Allow me to explain then. The door could only be opened by members of the P.I.C. Which means...
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. That's correct.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? <textEffects>(She... conceded so easily...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Take a look at this. It's a record of this room that I investigated just a while ago. At 12:52 AM, the door was opened using Ms. Crane's keycard.
</line><line><textEffects>Keycard Record jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
It's probable... ...that the killer entered the room together with the victim, Ms. Crane. After entering, the situation must have sourced, leading to the murder.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your logic holds... but it is still merely conjecture. And it would imply that the killer and the victim were acquainted.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No way, pal! Kay doesn't even know the victim!
</line><line>Courtney:

</line><line>Courtney:
That is merely an assumption on your part... Unless you have any evidence to prove your claim? Evidence is everything, in court and at the crime scene. Without it, your argument is invalid.
</line><line>Franziska:
In that case... I trust that you have evidence... ...to prove that Kay Faraday and the victim were connected.
</line><line>Courtney:
...Of course.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh... What!?
</line><line>Courtney:
This letter... ...was discovered by Dr. Young in Ms. Crane's breast pocket.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...The victim's belongings? Why did she withhold such vital evidence until now? Could it be... she was waiting for the perfect time to reveal it? Come to think of it...!)</textEffects>

Hmhm... I'll read it for you. <textEffects>"To Ms. Crane, Thank you so much for helping with my plan! I'm glad that we can help each other get what we want.

They probably planned to steal something from this room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
P-Preposterous!
</line><line>Franziska:
W-Wait! That means, the main culprit is...
</line><line>Courtney:
It's still Kay Faraday, of course. It just means her crimes have increased by yet one more.
</line><line><textEffects>Victim's Letter jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:

</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't believe her, Kay! It's all a bunch of nonsense! There's no way Kay would do something like that!
</line><line>Courtney:
Nonsense? Not at all. The evidence speaks for itself, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...! <textEffects>(I knew that they wouldn't suspect Kay unless they had some sort of proof, but... ...to think they would actually have such decisive evidence!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- The Letter from Kay --</textEffects></center>
<line>Courtney:
The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter.
She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan.
However, for some reason, their partnership broke down.
Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate.
Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
H-Her testimony's even better than ever. Maybe the most perfect it's ever been, sir...! Are you gonna be alright, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Um, yes... Of course.
</line><line>Franziska:
How unsightly, Miles Edgeworth. Save your stoic act for some other time.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ms. von Karma! Just whose side are you on!?
</line><line>Franziska:
I'm on nobody's side, Scruffy. When searching for the truth, it's best not to take sides.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
W-Watch what you say, Ms. von Karma, or else Mr. Debeste is gonna...
</line><line>Debeste:
"Best" you say? Well, I can tell you that the side I'm on is always the BYAAARGH!

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I don't think that Kay wrote the letter... ...but unless I can draw out more information here, that thought means nothing. I should start by pressing her for more details.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The victim held onto the truth until her dying breath... A truly touching story indeed.
</line><line>Courtney:
The voices of the dead are soft. One must listen carefully to hear their dying wishes... And Ms. Crane has spoken: Kay Faraday is the culprit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Perhaps the voices you have been hearing are actually the whispers of the devil.
</line><line>Debeste:
H-Hey! Don't make fun of Justine!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's listen to the voice of reason. Judge Courtney, please take a look at the autopsy report.
</line><line>Courtney:
There is no need. I remember it perfectly. The victim was stabbed in the left breast...! N-No, it can't be...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The letter was found in the victim's left breast pocket.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And that's where the victim was stabbed with the candelabra, right, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. It wouldn't have been possible to stab her there without piercing the letter as well!
</line><line>Courtney:
.....!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, that begs the question... Why was the letter found in the victim's pocket? It's simple. It was placed there after the victim was murdered to throw suspicion onto Kay! Somebody intentionally wanted to create this very situation! In other words, there exists the possibility that the letter was forged by the true culprit!
</line><line>Courtney:
Noooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The real murderer tried to pin the crime on Kay... That is the only explanation for the letter.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And in doing so, the murderer ended up digging their own grave, right, sir?

</line><line>Debeste:
The culprit is Kay Faraday! The letter was... Yeah! It was actually found in the victim's other pocket!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Huh? What're you saying, pal?
</line><line>Debeste:
The officer's report was wrong when he said the letter was in her left pocket! It's actually in the... YEOOOWWCH!
</line><line>Franziska:
A foolish fool who continues to make a fool of himself... Is there no cure for your foolishness!?
</line><line>Debeste:
Why do you keep whipping me!? And quit calling me a fool! YEAAARGH!
</line><line>Franziska:
I saved you the trouble of punishing him yourself.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-Indeed... <textEffects>(Though I had no intention of punishing him...)</textEffects> The letter is stained with blood, no doubt because it was found in the left breast pocket. There couldn't have been an error in the officer's report... Unless you were the investigator.
</line><line>Debeste:
U-Ugghh... Say something, Justine!
</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see you have no objections. ...Then allow me to continue. There is one more potential suspect in this case.
</line><line>Debeste:
Don't be ridiculous! The killer entered this very room! There wasn't anyone else who did that besides Kay Faraday and the victim!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(To enter the meeting room, one needs a keycard... And their reasoning assumes that the murderer and the victim entered the room together. This is what we overlooked. If we just discard that assumption, then...)</textEffects> <textEffects>This evidence reveals the other suspect besides Kay...!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This is the keycard record Judge Courtney handed me earlier. The victim's keycard was used at 12:52 AM... And there was one more person who also used a keycard.
</line><line>Franziska:
So you're saying this person was waiting to ambush the victim inside the meeting room? The keycard was used at 10:15 PM. I wouldn't say it's possible...
</line><line>Courtney:
No, it's impossible.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And what makes you say that, pal!? You got any proof!?
</line><line>Courtney:
Of course I do. I myself am that proof.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Courtney:
I was the one who used that keycard, after all.
</line><line><textEffects>Keycard Record updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Is there something strange about a P.I.C. remeber entering the P.I.C. meeting room?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. That proves nothing. The fact that you were in here at all makes you a suspect. Or do you perhaps have any evidence that you didn't kill your colleague?

</line><line>Courtney:
Why would I, a faithful servant of the law, commit a crime? True enough, I entered this room. However, that alone is not reason enough to suspect me of a crime.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If that's the case, please tell me why you entered this room.
</line><line>Courtney:
I had some business to take care of, and some preparations had to be made.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Preparations...! That sounds pretty suspicious, pal!
</line><line>Courtney:
Unfortunately, I cannot disclose what these preparations were. However... I'm sure you could hazard a guess, "<textEffects>Prosecutor</textEffects>" Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...So she was preparing for my hearing. She must have gathered all the necessary materials... ...to take away my Prosecutor's Badge.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Wonderful, wonderful. It's good to see young people go head-to-head so ruthlessly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who is that...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
That takes me back. When I was young, I'd always butt heads with this brash detective. ...A-And then one day... ...He just disappeared. I hope... he's still doing well... Ahh, h-here come the waterworks.
</line><line>Courtney:
Chairman Debeste...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Did she just say... Debeste?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Hello, Courtney. You sure are full of energy today. And if it isn't little Von Karma. Look how much you've grown since I last saw you.
</line><line>Franziska:
S-Sir... It has been quite a while...
</line><line>???:
...A curtsy? You don't have to treat me like some sort of stranger, y'know. Remember back in the old days, when you'd sit on my lap and call me Unky Boo Boo? *sniff* ...Here I go again. Oh... How I cried b-back then...
</line><line>Debeste:
Pops! What are you doing here!?
</line><line>???:
Hrm? A member of the P.I.C. was killed and I heard that you were in charge of the case.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...What kind of prosecutor is followed around by his own father?
</line><line>Courtney:
Hold your tongue! Do you have any idea who this man is? Chairman of the P.I.C., former Chief Prosecutor. He's the right hand of the Goddess of Law.
</line><line>???:
Now, now, Courtney. I'm just an old chunk of coal. There's no reason to speak so highly of me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please excuse my subordinate's behavior. I am...
</line><line>Blaise:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, isn't it? Along with his trusty sidekick Dick Gumshoe. I am Blaise Debeste. I'm the proud father of that idiot over there. When that boy was born, me and the missus were happy as can be, y'see... But now... I-I don't even know where she's gone to... *sob*
</line><line>Debeste:
P-Pops... You need a handkerchief?
</line><line>Blaise:
Ah, yes. Sebastian is an idiot, but he's such a good boy, y'know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Quite the doting father and son.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blaise:
Now then, Courtney. How's the investigation going?
</line><line>Courtney:
Sir. We've established that the culprit is Kay Faraday. We are currently focusing our efforts...

There are too many uncertainties in this case! It's impossible to determine that she's the culprit! Surely you haven't forgotten the matter of the letter!

</line><line>Debeste:
I already told you, it was just a simple mistake. The letter was in another pocke- YEOWCH!
</line><line>Franziska:
...You talk too much.
</line><line>Blaise:
Now, now. Let's all play nice. Everyone, just calm down.
</line><line>Courtney:
...I'm sorry that you had to witness such an unsightly scene, Mr. Chairman.
</line><line>Blaise:
Don't apologize Courtney. I can follow everyone's logic. ...Except Sebastian's, that is.
</line><line>Debeste:
H-Hey! Pops...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Chairman Debeste, I am a prosecutor. My duty is to bring criminals to justice. However, I won't make someone out to be a criminal without sufficient motive and evidence.
</line><line>Blaise:
Hrm, I've heard about you and your relationship with the suspect, y'know. Ah, to share such a strong bond...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay has assisted the police in arresting criminals countless times, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There are too many facets of this case that remain unexplored...!
</line><line>Blaise:
I see. The bonds of youth are a wonderful thing, indeed. ...But, that is that and this is this. Y'know?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What's that supposed to mean!?
</line><line>Blaise:
The Prosecutor's Office needs to resolve this case as quickly as possible. I mean, just think of all the other cases that are piling up. There's no time to waste here. It's unfortunate, but... you understand, right, Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...!?
</line><line>Blaise:
Now then, Kay Faraday. I'd like to arrest you now.
</line><line>Kay:
.....Okay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No! I won't let you! Kay's innocent, pal!
</line><line>Courtney:
To defy Chairman Debeste, is to defy the law. It would be a grave act of disloyalty. In other words, a hearing won't be needed. Are you prepared to lose your Prosecutor's Badge?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Th-That's...! Mr. Edgeworth's badge...! You can't do that!
</line><line>Franziska:
...Using a prosecutor's badge as a shield. What has the P.I.C. come to...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay...! You haven't done anything wrong!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... It was only for a short time, but... Thank you for everything... I'm sorry... I turned out to be a criminal...
</line><line>Courtney:
We will make sure to impart your confession to the Goddess of Law.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Nngh! <textEffects>(What... should I do!? When I was young, I wanted to become a defense attorney like my father... Someone who can fight to save those in need...! And right now... this badge is holding me back. A mere badge, for the life of a dear friend... I don't even have to consider it...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
...Alright. Farewell... Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hold it right there! Judge Courtney!
</line><line>Courtney:
...What is it now, Prosecutor Edgeworth?&#160;! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!
</line><line>Kay:
M... Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What are you doing!? Explain yourself! Miles Edgeworth! You... you can't be serious!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You... you're joking, right? If you aren't a prosecutor, then I...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
My only mission is to bring the truth to light. If it's the prosecutor's path to turn a blind eye to the truth... ...then that title is worth nothing to me! I... will walk in the path that I believe in. ...I will not be stopped here!

You, you're running away from Von Karma... from me!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....No matter what you say, I don't intend to go back on my decision.
</line><line>Franziska:
So... you're leaving me behind again!? I'll never... Never forgive you for this!
</line><line>Kay:
N-No... This is all my fault...! ...I'm sorry. If only I weren't here...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait! Kay! Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-But! Mr. Edgeworth...! Boss...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'm not your "boss" anymore, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Th-That's...! That's just too much, sir! It's always been you and me! We've always been a team!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, you no longer need to follow my lead. You... should try to accomplish whatever you can on your end!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
.....!
</line><line>Blaise:
Ahh, ahh, this is bad. We just let a dangerous criminal escape. How could I let her get away... and after all my hard work... Y'see...
</line><line>Courtney:
Rest assured, Mr. Chairman. This area will be locked down immediately.
</line><line>Blaise:
Good. I expect the best from you, Courtney.

<line>Edgeworth:
Kay! <textEffects>(She's not here either. Where in the world could she have gone...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Knock knock, I'm here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...!
</line><line>Ray:
What's going on, Miles? Why the long face...? Take it from Uncle Ray, you won't be popular with the ladies looking like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why are you here? Did something happen?
</line><line>Ray:
That's my line. Have you seen the news? About the murder at the P.I.C. headquarters? Your hearing... Wasn't it there today? I found myself wondering if you guys had somehow got caught up in it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait, it's already made the news?
</line><line>Ray:
I hear they're searching for a teenage girl suspected of killing an attorney... I can't imagine it could have been her, but... it has been bothering me. Could you give me the full rundown?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-The truth is...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
M-Miles, are you trying to give your Uncle Ray a heart attack?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not joking. She really did lose her memory...
</line><line>Ray:
On top of that, she's a suspect... That make things even difficult. Where would she have run off to? She lost her memory, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I was hoping she would return here, but...
</line><line>Ray:
Not likely. She felt responsible for what happened to you, right? Then, there's no way she would come back here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I know that! But, where else can I look...?
</line><line>Ray:
Calm down, Miles. This isn't like you. It's rare to see you get so heated up. Well... not that it's a bad thing. If you're trying this hard to save an innocent suspect from false charges... ...I'm sure you'd make a great defense attorney.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually... just a while ago... I turned in my badge... ...but that doesn't mean I've decided to become a defense attorney. Besides, Kay isn't just a mere suspect. I may have only known her for a short time... but we've been through quite a lot together. And I know she isn't capable of murder!
</line><line>Ray:
...I'm surprised. I never thought you would go so far to support someone else. I don't know if you even realize it yourself, but... ...it seems a deep bond has already begun to grow between you and Kay. I'd say it even gives my bond with your father a run for its money.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... It's not that deep. She just keeps barging into my state of affairs.
</line><line>Ray:
Ha ha. Yeah, that girl can be quite a handful. But I'm certain that something has changed inside you since you met her.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Ray:
I'm really jealous, you know. After all, I lost my old partner. That's why you need to find Kay right now. I don't want you to lose your bond like your Uncle Ray did...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Ray:
Well then, I have a proposal. We have no idea where she is. And searching around blindly won't get us anywhere. In that case... why don't we try searching for the cause of her memory loss? Maybe that could give us a lead?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... That might be a good idea. From what she told me, something must have happened to her at the Grand Tower...
</line><line>Ray:
Great, that's it! Let's get going then! Hey. At the very least, could you stop looking so grim? If you stay that way, Kay probably won't want to come back at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Good grief. <textEffects>(I'm not match for this man...)</textEffects>

<line><i>(Moving to the center of map after examining cherry tree and railing and talking to Karin leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Kay:
Aaaaah! Oww...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
Um, um... Don't mind me! I was just admiring the view beneath the tree!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Did you just fall out of that tree?
</line><line>Kay:
I didn't mean to fall! ...My foot slipped.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're a suspect, and yet you remained at the crime scene... That's not a smart thing to do. Even if you have memory loss, shouldn't you have realized this much? This whole time, while you were playing this silly game of hide-and-seek... ...I've been worried sick about you.
</line><line>Kay:
...Are you angry with me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Of course I am. Answer me. What were you doing here?
</line><line>Kay:
.....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you think I'd let you off the hook that easily just because you have memory loss?
</line><line>Kay:
Th-That's not it!! ...I came here because I thought I could get your badge back.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What?
</line><line>Kay:
If I don't regain my memories, you'll never get it back... I thought if I went back to where I lost my memories, then maybe I would remember... If I could just remember... killing her...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.......... .....Heh.
</line><line>Kay:
?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You're still the same as you were before you lost your memories. Your thoughts and actions have always exceeded my expectations. Without a doubt, you are the Kay Faraday I know so well... However... I cannot approve of your recklessness.
</line><line>Kay:
...I understand.
</line><line>Ray:
Cuuuuut! You get zero style points, Miles. Or more like, negative points! Here's how it's done. Kay, how about a hug?
</line><line>Kay:
O... Okay.
</line><line>Ray:
Oho! Well, then...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields!
</line><line>Ray:
It was just a joke. Honest!
</line><line>Announcer:
<textEffects>We interrupt this program with breaking news about the Grand Tower murder case... The police believe the culprit is a teenage girl who was present at the crime scene. She remains at large as the police continue to search for her whereabouts.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
...!
</line><line>Ray:
Oh dear... This is getting pretty serious. Well, gang, what's the plan? We don't have much time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's only a matter of time before they find us here.
</line><line>Ray:
So then, why don't you tag along with us for a while, Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
But, I'll just cause trouble for you again...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It pains me to say this but I've got nothing left to lose at this point.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...!
</line><line>Ray:
This settles it. We're all in this together now. Miles, you're in charge of proving Kay's innocence. Failure is not an option.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. I understand.
</line><line>Ray:
Kay, I want you to help Miles with his investigation as much as you can!
</line><line>Kay:
Y-Yes! I'll do my best.
</line><line>Ray:
Let's be quick about it! Before the cops find us here! Unlike some people, Uncle Ray still has a lot to lose! Sheesh... If I lose the law office, I'll never be able to face Gregory...

<line>Edgeworth:
Do you know how many floors this building has?
</line><line>Ray:
Of course. 50 floors, right? Just above the place where the P.I.C. conducts their "Practically Illegal Coverups"... ...couples are wishing for love. Kinda ironic, don't you think?
</line><line>Kay:
So, what's this dark area above the 50th floor?
</line><line>Ray:
Maybe it's the Tunnel of Love... Those are always dark, eh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The viewing platform we're on now should be directly above the P.I.C. meeting room. However, the late-night investigation is taking place two floors below us. This is a clear contradiction!
</line><line>Kay:
Was there a mistake in the pamphlet?
</line><line>Ray:
No no, rather...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's more natural to assume this building has a hidden <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Is there a floor 51? - There seems to be a 51st floor between the 50th floor and rooftop.">51st floor</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Is there a floor 51? - There seems to be a 51st floor between the 50th floor and rooftop.)</textEffects></span>.
</line><line>Kay:
I see! So that's where the Tunnel of Love is!
</line><line>Ray:
Awww... She's so pure and gullible, it's breaking Uncle Ray's heart.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then why don't you take this opportunity to be more serious for once?
</line><line>Ray:
You just don't get it, Miles. I joke around to make things easier for you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(On the contrary, his painful jokes only make things harder for me.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
An extra floor between the 50th floor and the viewing platform... Why didn't anyone notice it?
</line><line>Ray:
Normally, you'd notice it. I mean, how can you hide an entire floor?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is where the problem lies. No one noticed something that should have been easily noticeable. In other words, it must be impossible to access the 51st floor through normal means!
</line><line>Kay:
I see. Maybe there's a secret portal or something!
</line><line>Ray:
Kay... Now's not the time to be thinking with portals.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'd like you to recall the hatch at the base of the cherry tree. Isn't it normal to assume there's a room on the other side of the maintenance hatch?
</line><line>Ray:
Heh heh... Uncle Ray likes where you're going with this.
</line><line>Kay:
Let's hurry and check it out.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
There... we go. Now let's see...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is...!
</line><line>Kay:
Looks like there's a lot of stuff down there. Is this what they call... a storeroom?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is no doubt about it. This is where Kay fell down.
</line><line>Ray:
Of course. And with this the mystery is solved!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, not yet. <textEffects>(We still have the mystery of the person in the red hood who was walking in mid-air...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Now, now. Let's not get greedy, shall we? We've found the storeroom, so let's wrap things up here.

I suppose... you have a point. <textEffects>(Hmm. It does seem to warrant an investigation.)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>Investigation Complete</textEffects></center>
<line>???:
Well, if it isn't Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ema! What are you doing here?
</line><line>Ema:
I heard about the case from Detective Gumshoe! Since I was already in the area, I thought I might as well check out the crime scene!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This girl's name is Ema Skye. She's a high school student studying in Europe to become a forensic scientist. She's the younger sister of my former boss, and a witness in one of my trials two years ago.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Detective Gumshoe told me everything over the phone! He sounded really upset! He said you lost your badge at the Grand Tower, and Kay became a mummy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
P-Please calm down. I thought you left for Europe just a few days ago... Don't tell me you've come back already?
</line><line>Ema:
Yep! And I've brought my teacher from abroad too. He needed an interpreter, so I volunteered to help.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If your teacher cannot speak English, why aren't you with him right now?
</line><line>Ema:
He can still communicate with people! Don't underestimate the importance of body language!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...That doesn't really count as a language.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
But enough about that! What happened to Kay!? Is she alright!?
</line><line>Ray:
My, my, what a good friend. Isn't this great, Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
Y-Yeah...
</line><line>Ema:
Umm, who are you? Are you Mr. Edgeworth's new assistant?
</line><line>Ray:
Ha ha ha! On the contrary, my dear. I'm Ray Shields, head of the Edgeworth Law Offices.
</line><line>Ema:
Edgeworth... Law Offices? Wait, you mean like defense attorneys!? Mr. Edgeworth, when did you suddenly become an attorney!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
N-No, it's not like that... <textEffects>(Now that I think about it, it is a rather complicated working relationship.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Don't sweat the details. Let's start with an introductory hug...
</line><line>Ema:
Why'd you become a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Ray:
Hey, don't just ignore me...
</line><line>Ema:
Because I don't approve at all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uh. Hm... Well, why don't we continue this conversation down below?
</line><line>Kay:
That's right. The police could arrive any second now.
</line><line>Ema:
...? Mr. Edgeworth, who's she?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll explain later. First, we have to go down the hatch.
</line><line>Ema:
Ah, OK. Guess I'll be joining the prosecu- err... defense team?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'll explain about that, too.
</line><line>Ray:
Well then! Let's go go go to the storeroom!
