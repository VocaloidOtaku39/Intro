       <verse n="1"><person>Booker T.</person> Was a practical man. He said, <quote> Till the soil and learn from the land. Let down your bucket Where you are. Your fate is here And not afar. To help yourself And your fellow man, Train your head, Your heart, and your hand.</quote></verse>
        <!-- This is a reference to a quote by Booker T. Washington he made while giving out a speech in Atlanta in 1895. -->
       
        <verse n="2">For smartness alone's Surely not <action>meet</action>— If you haven't at the same time Got
        something to <action>eat</action>. Thus at Tuskegee He <action>built</action> a <place
            located="Tuskegee">school</place> With book-learning there And the workman's tool.
        <!-- This is a reference to the time when Booker established the Tuskegee Institute. --> He
        started out In a simple way— For <time>yesterday</time> Was not <time>today</time>.</verse> 
       
       <verse n="3">Sometimes he had Compromise in his talk— For a man must <action>crawl</action> Before he can walk— And
        in <state>Alabama</state> in <year is="1885">'85</year> A joker was <feeling>lucky</feeling>
        To be alive. But <person>Booker T.</person> Was nobody's fool: You may <action>carve</action> a dream With an humble tool. The tallest <building>tower</building> Can
        <action>tumble</action> down If it be not <action>rooted</action> In solid
        ground. </verse>
       
       <verse n="4">So, being a far-seeing Practical man, He <action>said</action>, <quote>Train your
            head, Your heart, and your hand. Your fate is here And not afar, So
            let down your bucket Where you are.</quote></verse></poem>
