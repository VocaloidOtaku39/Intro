"Shichishito". The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means "7 Branched Sword". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...

Maya:
Hey, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah? What is it?
</line><line>Maya:
You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.
</line><line>Maya:
But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... I guess so, yeah.
</line><line>Maya:
Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Pearls...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
So! That's why we need to go on a special "Spiritual Hot Spot Tour", Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?
</line><line>Pearl:
It's the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Oh. <textEffects>(Pearls looks so happy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.
</line><line>Maya:
It's at a spiritual retreat called "Hazakura Temple". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now I definitely don't want to go...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?
</line><line>Pearl:
Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah! And I signed up for the "Special Course"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.
</line><line>Maya:
Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!
</line><line>Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?
</line><line>Maya:
Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this "Hazakura Temple"?
</line><line>Pearl:
No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.
</line><line>Maya:
Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun...

</line><line>Maya:
Huh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go.
</line><line>Maya:
Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?

Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?

</line><line>???:
Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.
</line><line>Maya:
Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--
</line><line>Bikini:
Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.
</line><line>Maya:
B-B-B-Bikini...!?
</line><line>Bikini:
That's riiight! Actually, that's my "temple" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, "Why not choose a bikini?" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!
</line><line>Maya:
It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your "Special Course"!
</line><line>Bikini:
Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!
</line><line>Pearl:
R-Reckless...?
</line><line>Maya:
"Wa ha ha"...?
</line><line>Pearl:
Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.
</line><line>Maya:
But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--
</line><line>Bikini:
Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?

Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.
</line><line>Maya:
Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, "Dusty Bridge".

Read it again, Maya. It says, "<textEffects>Dusky Bridge</textEffects>".

You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!
</line><line>Butz:
Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.
</line><line>Butz:
Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...)</textEffects> However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.
</line><line>Butz:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. <textEffects>(This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Butz:
I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can <textEffects>represent</textEffects> her!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... What did you just say?
</line><line>Butz:
You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...
</line><line>Butz:
Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!

</line><line>Iris:
M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Fortunately, he will be fine. <textEffects>(Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?)</textEffects> He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.
</line><line>Iris:
... Thank goodness...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.
</line><line>Iris:
A cold...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.

</line><line>Iris:
Thank you very much for listening to my story.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...
</line><line>Iris:
...M-Me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.
</line><line>Iris:

</line><line>Iris:
Yes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Er... Wh-Why would you ask that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.

... Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.
</line><line>Iris:
... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You "deceived" him...?
</line><line>Iris:
I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.
</line><line>Iris:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.

... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think you mean "affaire de coeur". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?
</line><line>Butz:
Ooooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>I believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.
</line><line>Butz:
I told you before... Don't call me "Larry"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The person you were waiting for was... Iris!
</line><line>Butz:
Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No doubt because of my chilly glare.
</line><line>Butz:
So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)</textEffects> <textEffects>Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!
</line><line>Butz:
Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.
</line><line>Butz:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!
</line><line>Butz:
Ohhh... OHHHH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, "<textEffects>Salutation here</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Butz:
W-Well that's what it said in that book, "Letter Writing for Dummies"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, "<textEffects>Dear Iris,</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Butz:
WAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY!

What do you mean, Detective?

Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!

If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.

<textEffects>(Hmm... He's right!)</textEffects> Larry!

Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!

What was this "<textEffects>something incredible</textEffects>" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!

<line>Butz:
I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true.
</line><line>Butz:
Wh-What doesn't?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Yes, Larry... I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.
</line><line>Butz:
... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal!

Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!?
