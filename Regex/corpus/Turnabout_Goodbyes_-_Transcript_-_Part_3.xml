Say... is this air tank yours?

Wh-why would I have a thing like that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.

...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!?

You used this to inflate that, didn't you?

I-inflate what!?

<textEffects>(Looks like I hit the nail on the head.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Butz:
... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(As I suspected!)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
It "didn't go so well"?

Er, yeah.

C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it...
</line><line>Maya:
Tell us! Tell us!
</line><line>Butz:
... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then...
</line>
<captions aligned="center">BLAAAAM!</captions>
<line>Butz:
The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it!

What!? Off into Gourd Lake?

It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure.

This... is Gourdy.

Umm... scuze me?
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
</line><line>Lotta:
A "<textEffects>bang</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
</line><line>Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
</line><line>Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Lotta.

Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.

</line><line>Lotta:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Something else?

Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked <textEffects>twice</textEffects>, you know.
</line><line>Maya:
...! Wait... so you have another photo?
</line><line>Lotta:
Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.

Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.

It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.
</line><line>Maya:
The "legend"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."

Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.

Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We have to figure out who that old man is.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Maya:
He locked the door, from the other side.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this <span style="color:#E16935">DL-6 Incident</textEffects>... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.)</span>

... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is <textEffects>the Station's Records Room</textEffects>. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.

All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!

Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.

Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.

Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!

<textEffects>(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)</textEffects>

Nick! I found out where the file is!

O-oh, thanks!
</line><line>Maya:
Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!

I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
</line><line>Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...

Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...
