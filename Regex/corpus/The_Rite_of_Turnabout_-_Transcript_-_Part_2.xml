<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps. But did he really?
</line><line>Rayfa:
What nonsense is this?! Is it not abundantly clear?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, it's not. Because there is something strange about those <textEffects>footsteps</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rayfa:
S-Strange? Explain yourself, Barbed Head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The <span style="color:#E16935">footsteps</textEffects> are strange because...</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
They're <textEffects>not getting any louder</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
And why exactly does that matter?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please focus your attention on the <textEffects>incense</textEffects> the victim smelled. The scent grows stronger as the accused approaches. If the accused really had approached the victim... ...the sound of her footsteps would've grown louder as the scent of incense grew stronger!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Ahhh!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Why, that makes perfect sense! How can this be explained, Your Benevolence?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Um, w-well... There must be a reason...

</line><line>Nahyuta:
It is as they say... "<textEffects>Even a putrid worm of a lawyer will turn.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What does that even mean...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
He's not exactly singing your praises, that's for sure.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Still, we cannot discount this information solely on account of its lawyerly source. Your Benevolence... Perhaps you must listen more carefully to the abbot's mitamah.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Listen more carefully? What's he talking about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmm... Yes, it would appear so. I shall try to <textEffects>refine</textEffects> the sensation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-Refine the sensation?
</line><line>Rayfa:
I can more accurately gauge sensations by deepening my communication with a mitamah.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I didn't know you could do that. <textEffects>(Why have we never done this before?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
By refining a sensation, a clearer picture of the truth can be discovered.
</line><line>Rayfa:
O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Hear me now and respond to my call!
</line><line>Judge:
"<textEffects>Footsteps</textEffects>" changed into "<textEffects>bells</textEffects>"? What could this mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Bells? But the only <span style="color:#E16935">bells</textEffects> at the scene of the crime were...)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! That jingling must've come from Abbot Inmee's <textEffects>bells</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean those big things he had on his ankles?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Well, there you have it. The sound of bells was from <textEffects>the high priest's own footsteps</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Th-Then that means...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the <textEffects>footsteps</textEffects> belonged to the <textEffects>victim himself</textEffects>... It means it was the <textEffects>victim</textEffects> who was moving -- not the accused! The victim was the one who went running toward the broken lantern from the spring! A far cry from what Her Benevolence's Insight would have us believe!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Nngh!
</line><line><textEffects>Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But why would the victim have approached the accused?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe he was trying to defend himself.
</line><line>Judge:
Please explain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He could've felt threatened by Lady Kee'ra standing there with a dagger. If so, he might have thought to overpower her before she attacked.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Still your voices! This is nothing but a theory, and a poor one at that! B-Be not led astray by this lawyer's obvious postulation!
</line><line>Nahyuta:

</line><line>Nahyuta:
While his insolence is inexcusable... ...I would ask that you calm yourself, Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Is there something you would care to say, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Even if it was Abbot Inmee who moved, it does not negate the accused's crime.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The accused was likely waiting for the high priest to approach.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Ah!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
And as he neared, she plunged the dagger into him. It is as simple as that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, right... It really doesn't change much, does it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Yes! It is as the prosecutor has said! In fact, it is as I meant to say all along as well!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Riiight... And that's why you were so shocked when you first heard it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Understand now, lawyer? That contradiction you conjured up has come to naught. Once I hone my Insights, it will vanish like the dying rays of the sun!
</line>

<line><s>...he heard the accused's approaching  footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.</s>
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.
</line><line>Rayfa:
See? The fact that it was Abbot Inmee who moved... changes nothing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arngh! <textEffects>(C'mon Phoenix. You gotta keep your cool. That contradiction I pointed out must mean something. That one sensation changed after Princess Rayfa refined her vision. It stands to reason that something else might have changed too because of the refinement. I should focus on <span style="color:#E16935">any sensations</textEffects> that have changed... ...while searching for more contradictions between them and her Insights!)</span>

<line>Rayfa:
<textEffects>The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Hold it! How do we know the Purification Rite was performed exactly as it was supposed to be?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. That's easy. The customs governing the rite are very clear, and Abbot Inmee would've adhered to them.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, that's strange.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain just what is so strange?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. I would ask you to consider the sound of the <textEffects>victim's footsteps</textEffects>. The <textEffects>sound of bells</textEffects> changes to the <textEffects>sound of water</textEffects> at one point.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What's this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's simple. The victim must have stepped in some water.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Oh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. And the only source of water in the Inner Sanctum... is the <textEffects>spring</textEffects>. ...And therein lies the contradiction!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wh-What contradiction?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe the rite started out as it should have. The victim stood with his back to the spring, and the accused stood right in front of him. But, we now know that the victim then moved into the spring.
</line><line>Judge:
P-Pohlkunka! That is absurd!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This means the accused's location differs from what Her Benevolence's Insight indicates!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Aaaungh!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-Then, where do you propose the accused stood once she donned Lady Kee'ra's robes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Until this moment, we've all just assumed... ...that Abbot Inmee and Ms. Fey were standing where they were supposed to be... ...as shown in this rites guide. In short... The victim should've been standing with his back to the spring, and the accused in front. However, if that is how they were really standing... ...he couldn't have stepped into the spring as he approached her. The problem is, the victim DID step into the spring. This can only mean that Ms. Fey had actually been standing in the water!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But if this is true... then their positions would've been completely reversed!
</line><line><textEffects>Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is going on here, Ms. Fey! Were you really standing in the spring?
</line><line>Maya:
...I-I'm sorry, but... I barely remember anything about the rite.

</line><line>Rayfa:
Be that as it may, this does not overturn my Insights!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It doesn't?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Let us say the accused was standing in the spring. ...So what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
..."So what"? This completely reverses their positions is what!
</line><line>Rayfa:
That their positions differed from what is customary is rather curious. However, what does that change? It certainly does not erase the accused's brutal crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
..................I guess you have a point there.
</line><line>Rayfa:
You lawyers are an absurd breed. Never thinking ahead, you cling to the first insignificant contradiction you can muster.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk!
</line><line>Maya:
Sounds like Princess Rayfa has a pretty good grasp on what lawyers are all about.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Oh, Maya. Where would I be without your brutally frank commentary right now. <textEffects>(Is this contradiction really meaningless? But something really doesn't feel right. Did I take a wrong turn somewhere?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Insight Revised</captions>
<line><s>...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.</s>
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the pool-side lantern.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Now the contradiction is no more. But the truth of the matter still stands, no matter how stubbornly you deny it.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nnngh...!
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Your Magistry, this lawyer may have raised a trivial objection... ...but Her Benevolence's Insights have no further inadequacies of any kind.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... So it would seem.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait a second! But there IS another contradiction!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Still you flounder about? Wretched beast... Though you rack that putrid brain of yours, nothing worthwhile will come of it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya, please tell me you remember something that might help us out here...
</line><line>Maya:
Sorry... I really don't remember a thing. But now that the place I was standing in has changed, who knows? That alone may cause a new discrepancy with Princess Rayfa's Insights.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's right. We now know that Maya was standing <span style="color:#E16935">in the spring</textEffects>. A major change like that could very well produce a contradiction. I should take another look at the Inner Sanctum diagram in the Court Record... ...and confirm where Maya and Abbot Inmee were standing. And then focus on finding any discrepancies between their positions and the Insights.)</span>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction.
</line><line>Rayfa:
You... You did? Hmph. No doubt it is but another of your vile attempts to slander my Insights.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope. Take a good look at what the victim saw. It just might change your mind. The lantern flame behind the accused was flickering.
</line><line>Rayfa:
There is nothing unusual about that. Especially as the wind had stirred.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, that's where you're wrong. If the accused had been standing in the spring... ...then what you see here should be one of the lanterns flanking the statue.
</line><line>Rayfa:
I fail to see your point.
</line><line>Phoenix:
My point is, something is wrong here. The two lanterns flanking the statue were both outfitted with glass wind guards. So neither lantern's flame should have been flickering in the wind in the first place!
</line><line>Rayfa:
........................Heh.
</line><line>Maya:
She seems pretty tickled, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't remember saying anything funny.
</line><line>Rayfa:
I fail to see what you wish to prove here, but... very well. I shall refine the vision and reveal the truth for all to see. O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Fix your sight upon the lantern there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-Huh? That lantern doesn't have a wind guard on it.
</line><line>Rayfa:
And rightly so. For the wind guard was removed to reveal the sacred flame within for the <textEffects>Rite of Fire</textEffects>. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the flame flickering.
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-Say whaaat?! B-But when we searched the crime scene, those lanterns had their wind guards on!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
That's because the police put them back on. The sacred flames have burned uninterrupted for hundreds of years, defense. We could not risk them being extinguished, even during an investigation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That would never fly back home...
</line><line>Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Are you done quibbling? If so, then it is time to bow down before this testimony of the mitamah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........Arnghk!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Don't worry, Maya! I'm just getting started! <textEffects>(All right, let's go over everything we know so far. Maya was wearing Lady Kee'ra's robes and standing in the spring. The high priest is thought to have been moving toward her. So I should look for sensations that stand in contradiction to this arrangement. I won't give up! I'm going to find a contradiction that will undermine the accusation against Maya!)</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What could this possibly mean? That lantern clearly contradicts the Insight... But this contradiction... ...will overturn the entire case I've been building.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Are you all right, Mr. Wright? One minute you shout out, and in the next, you fall silent.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Perhaps it is like the bellow of one who is barreling down a hill with no way of stopping. Is that not right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
..................
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Don't get cold feet now, Phoenix. Even if this overturns the entire case you've built so far... ...the only way is to keep moving forward -- because that's where we'll find the truth!)</textEffects> ...Sorry, but I'm not barreling down a hill. In fact, I'm in full control of everything with the indisputable contradiction I found!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Is that so?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The lantern behind the accused clearly-- No, BLATANTLY contradicts your Insight!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Does it now...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
One of the lanterns on the entrance side of the Inner Sanctum was broken. And if you watch what Abbot Inmee saw in his final moments... ...you will notice that the lantern behind the praying form of Ms. Fey is broken. The lantern behind Lady Kee'ra, however, is still intact. In short, we are seeing two different lanterns in this Séance vision!
</line><line>Rayfa:
H-How could this be?! And even if it were so, how would that contradict my Insights?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
.................. Let me start by saying, the claim I'm about to raise... ...will overturn the case I've built thus far.
</line><line>Judge:
Will the defense please explain himself?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Based on the broken lantern, we can tell...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Where the accused and the victim were standing!
</line><line>Judge:
But did you not just finish asserting that the accused was standing somewhere else?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I did. And I built my argument on that faulty premise. But thankfully, it has led us here... ...to the actual spot where Maya Fey was standing!
</line><line>Judge:
I must say, if the defense keeps changing its assertions in such a capricious manner... ...its credibility may come into question.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm willing to take that risk, Your Magistry, because I believe this will be the last time. I'd like to start by pointing out the actual spot where the accused was standing.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... Show us where you now believe the accused was actually standing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place. We know the victim had stepped into the spring. That means Maya Fey had to have been standing in the water as he approached. However, his memory, which has only now become clear, reveals that... ...Ms. Fey was standing by the side of the <textEffects>broken lantern</textEffects>. In other words... ...she was standing where she was supposed to be according to custom.
</line><line>Rayfa:

</line><line>Rayfa:
Does that not bring us back to the very beginning?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, this is where things take a different turn -- and I mean that literally. The victim had to have been moving toward the spring. That means that while he was moving, he had his back turned toward the accused!
</line><line>Rayfa:
What's this?! Do you mean to say the victim turned around during the rite?! But such an image appears nowhere in the Séance vision!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, it does appear. It's just that no one noticed until now.
</line><line>Judge:
N-No one noticed?! How could no one have noticed something so big?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There was a moment when the scripture the victim was holding was all we could see. Thanks to that, none of us could tell that he was, in fact, turning around in that moment.
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Nngh!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
If it is as the defense asserts, then Her Benevolence's Insights no longer make sense. How do you intend to explain that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't need to explain anything, because it's just as you said, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Her Benevolence's Insights DON'T make any sense because they contain a huge error!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...S-Such insolence!	
</line><line>Judge:
A huge error, you say? Do explain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The huge error is...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime: The victim was reading a sutra when suddenly, he sensed someone behind him. He immediately looked back to see someone dressed as Lady Kee'ra standing there. Wishing to see who it was, he approached the robed figure. That's when he was stabbed!
</line><line>Rayfa:
This cannot be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, but it can. And it is! The Insight stating the accused stabbed the victim is wrong! And that is the real truth lying behind this testimony of the dead!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Po...
</line><line>Judge:
Po...
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Po...

<line>Judge:
Are you sure about this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
My work as an international prosecutor has taken me to courtrooms around the world. And in that time, I have learned to perform last rites for souls in trials lacking a Séance.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, of course. Forgive my ludicrous inquiry.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Moreover, I have with me a forensic investigator from overseas. I will show you all the most magnificent last rites ever seen.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess he really does think highly of Ema and her forensic expertise. I'm impressed that he's come to understand their value. Then again... ...he IS an international prosecutor who's solved tough cases around the world. Time to hunker down, huh...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, let us continue with today's proceedings. Could the defense please tell us who the third party dressed as Lady Kee'ra was? Your new claim has negated the Insights of the royal priestess... ...so I trust you have some evidence to support it, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course. <textEffects>(This third party must have really <span style="color:#E16935">wanted to 
kill</textEffects>  the high priest. I might be able to identify who it was if I had evidence of their <textEffects>murderous intent</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, we're waiting, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Three days before the Purification Rite... ...the victim received a <textEffects>warning letter</textEffects> from an unidentified individual!
</line><line>Judge:
He did?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, "<textEffects>Do not perform the rite.</textEffects>" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.
</line><line>Judge:
Who do you suppose sent that letter?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A person with something to hide -- <textEffects>the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects> herself!
</line><line>Judge:
Peace! I-I... I don't understand. I had heard the Lady Kee'ra that has been in the news of late only hunted <textEffects>rebels</textEffects>. If so, why would she have killed the high priest?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Excellent question. Maybe it would help to think of it this way: What if the high priest... <textEffects>had secretly been a rebel</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Gallery:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">The high priest?! He couldn't possibly have been a rebel!</captions>
<line>Judge:
The high priest -- a devout follower of Khura'inism... a rebel?! Do you even comprehend the blasphemy of which you speak? Well? DO YOU?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I, too, found it hard to believe at first. But as I continued my investigation, it started to become more and more plausible.

</line><line>Nahyuta:
But fear not, good people of Khura'in. The rantings of this putrid-brained lawyer who seeks to sully the soul of the deceased... ...shall come to no avail once I conclude these last rites. The prosecution's assertion that the accused killed the victim remains unchanged.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But...the victim was stabbed in his abdomen! How is that possible when he had his back turned toward Ms. Fey?! Someone else must have killed him!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Are you sure about that? You may have invalidated the Séance, but do not let it go to your putrid head. The karmic flow of this trial is, as yet, still in my hands.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How can he be so confident?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. And I shall prove that by calling a new witness to the stand. ...An <textEffects>eyewitness</textEffects> who will deliver a definitive answer that will dispel the defense's doubts.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-An eyewitness...?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let us call this eyewitness to the stand.
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's him again!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, now... He has to be the shaggiest witness I have ever laid eyes upon. Please state your name and occupation.

Oh, um... I'm, ya know, that so-and-so, whatchamacallit! <textEffects>A'nohn Ihmus TBD</textEffects>! 'Least that's what they've been calling me!
</line><line>Judge:
"TBD"? As in "<textEffects>to be determined</textEffects>"? Can't you just tell us your real name?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The witness has suffered a blow to the head, rendering him amnesiac. Therefore... ...I named him "A'nohn Ihmus (TBD)" in my report, but he thinks "TBD" is part of his name.

You're letting an amnesiac testify?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Have no fear. I have already questioned him at length. While it is true he has utterly forgotten his name and past... ...his memory of what he witnessed is still very much intact.

Considering the dearth of information, any new knowledge may be of help. Therefore, I will permit his testimony. Now, Mr. Ihmus, please tell us what you saw.

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects><textEffects>-- The Night of the Murder --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Ihmus:
That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum.
I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace.
I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around...
...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.
That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
There's no way you saw Ms. Fey stab the victim with a dagger!
</line><line>Maya:
I-I swear I don't know what he's talking about! ...Or don't remember, at any rate!
</line><line>Judge:
Mt. Poniponi... the beautiful mountain that is also known as the Little Sanctum.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They must be talking about that smaller mountain from the poster...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Ihmus, I was wondering...
</line><line>Ihmus:
What can I do ya for?
</line><line>Judge:
The Inner Sanctum lies at a high elevation where clouds and fog can obscure the view. Are you sure you were able to see what happened from the mountaintop next to it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Good point!)</textEffects> H-His Magistry raises an excellent question! Well, Mr. Ihmus?!
</line><line>Ihmus:
On the day of the rite, there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had a perfect view! If ya don't believe me, check the weather forecast in the paper that day!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Don't we have the newspaper for that day?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, let's take a look. Hmm... It does say <textEffects>calm, clear skies</textEffects>, doesn't it?
</line><line>Ihmus:
See? Told ya so!
</line><line><textEffects>May 9th Newspaper updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, it would appear the witness has offered testimony worth hearing.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Mr. Ihmus. I, too, have a question for you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Didn't he already question the witness?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ihmus:
Well, that's what I'm here for, right? Shoot!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
How was the accused holding the dagger? Was she holding it underhanded, its blade protruding from the bottom of her hand?
</line><line>Ihmus:
Yep, I believe she was! It's called a reverse grip!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Ah... I thought as much.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Hold it right there! What bearing does that have on this case?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Cease your interruptions, you putrid-headed lawyer. Do you not see the significance in how the blade was held?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why don't you enlighten me, O enlightened one?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Feh. I knew you were a fool. I can already picture you in your next life.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-Next life...?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Yes... After your soul writhes for centuries in the pits of hell... ...you shall be reborn as a witless sea urchin, with barbs limited to your posterior. You shall live a short, inconsequential life, only to be brutally devoured by a sea otter.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That was a bit excessive. I simply asked what the dagger grip had to do with the case.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Now, pay attention.  How the accused held the dagger is of vital importance. With such information, we can infer exactly what actions she took. You were saying that the victim was killed while he had his back to the accused. Is that correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes...
</line><line>Nahyuta:
As such, the accused's dagger grip tells us something very important: The accused approached the victim from behind, swung her arms around him... ...and plunged the dagger deep into his abdomen, using a reverse grip!
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Thus, Mr. Ihmus's testimony clears up any doubts that might remain.
</line><line>Judge:
Ha ha ha! And it coincides with Her Benevolence's Insights as well!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is a disaster! I thought I'd blown those Insights out of the water, but now they're back to haunt me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness.

</line><line>Ihmus:
What?!  You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony.
</line><line>Judge:
H-His testimony, you say?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Recall how the Inner Sanctum was that day. Specifically, that it was completely enclosed by the ritual curtain.
</line><line>Judge:
Why yes! I believe you're right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The curtain would have completely blocked the witness's view from Mt. Poniponi. Therefore, he couldn't possibly have seen the murder happen!
</line><line>Ihmus:
Hoo-hah...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Ihmus, have you been knowingly making false statements to this court?!

<line>Phoenix:
You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry,  but that's just not possible.
</line><line>Ihmus:
Wh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I think I'm going to need a "logicalese" translation on that...)</textEffects> Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held "when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi."
</line><line>Ihmus:
Doot doot doooooot...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi.
</line><line>Judge:
O Holy Mother!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain!
</line><line>Ihmus:
N-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen.
</line><line>Ihmus:
But...! I did see those silhouettes! Really!
</line><line>Maya:
But how could he, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? <textEffects>(Wait... Don't tell me...!)</textEffects> Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light!
</line><line>Judge:
And that would be...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!
</line><line>Ihmus:
D-Doot doot dooooot...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh? Then where do you propose the witness was?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Someplace where he could have seen the shadow figures</textEffects>, naturally!
</line><line>Maya:
Wait! You mean... 
</line><line>Phoenix:
None of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from.
</line><line>Judge:
...And where might that be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures!
</line><line>Ihmus:
Hoo-haaaaaah!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.........Ngh!
</line><line>Maya:
Really?! Wow, I didn't even think of that!
</line><line>Judge:
But wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.....................
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, you mean...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. <textEffects>This witness was at the scene of the crime</textEffects>. Which means he is the <textEffects>mysterious third party</textEffects> we saw during the Divination Séance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest!

No one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space?

Oh, umm... He must've, uhhh...  <textEffects>(I haven't thought THAT far ahead...)</textEffects>

The sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs.

Boy, you lawyers sure are scary!

<textEffects>(I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...)</textEffects>

<captions aligned="center">GalleryYeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there!</captions>
<line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
"A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment." It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!)</textEffects>

And just so you know, you've already accrued 200 million extra years.

Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.

<textEffects>The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.</textEffects>

<line>Ihmus:
<textEffects>Boy, you lawyers sure are scary!</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mr. Ihmus wasn't at the Inner Sanctum? Or more precisely, couldn't get there?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... I don't see a way out of this. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence!
</line><line>Maya:
Like when you're trying to catch frogs from a pond! Once you've got a grip on one, you'd better hold on tight!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-Right... Something like that.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
...Mr. Ihmus is right. He couldn't have skydived down there without any gear.
</line><line>Ihmus:
Well now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is.
</line><line>Ihmus:
Wh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!)</textEffects> Take a look at this piece of evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
Those are <textEffects>prayer flags</textEffects>, are they not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a <textEffects>parachute</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Pohlkunka...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
N-No, this cannot be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus?
</line><line>Ihmus:
There's no way out. I'm surrounded!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... Mr. Ihmus?
</line><line>Ihmus:
All this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Grrrrrr...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
As I suspected, there WERE three people there that night!
</line><line>Maya:
You did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you?
</line><line>Ihmus:
Whaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident!
</line><line>Phoenix:
By accident?
</line><line>Ihmus:
Exactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material?
</line><line>Ihmus:
It may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?!
</line><line>Judge:
Now, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that <textEffects>the witness was at the Inner Sanctum</textEffects> is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony.

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects><textEffects>-- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Ihmus:
That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider.
But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened!
An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!
As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory!
So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nahyuta:
Mr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning.
</line><line>Ihmus:
Can't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Continue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the <textEffects>Hell of Hangnails</textEffects>... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for 800 million years.
</line><line>Ihmus:
HOO-HAAAAAAH! ...I think I'll pass on that!

Okay, Nick! Time for some evidence. You know, really grab him by the scruff of his neck!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. <textEffects>(But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: "<textEffects>One lie begets another.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Ihmus:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks!
</line><line>Ihmus:
What did you just say?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, "<textEffects>The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Ihmus:
P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I do believe it does say that!
</line><line>Maya:
<textEffects>One lie begets another</textEffects>... That makes sense, but... Is it really a saying back home? I've never heard of it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... I kind of made that one up.
</line><line>Maya:
For real?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause.
</line><line>Judge:
More fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where?
</line><line>Ihmus:
...........................
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!)</textEffects> Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. <textEffects>To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ihmus:
Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's where he came from?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from <textEffects>Royal Penitentiary No. 4</textEffects>! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest!
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the <textEffects>rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Ihmus:
HOOOOOOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sir! Help me out here!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
..................
</line><line>Maya:
You did it! You finally left him speechless!
</line><line>Ihmus:
Aw, c'mon, Mr. Prosecutor Man!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Quiet, you fool. You should use this time to prepare yourself for what is to come. For a fate far worse than Hangnail Hell awaits you now.
</line><line>Ihmus:
.........
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Well done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Huh? He didn't even put up a fight this time. That's awfully... generous of him.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
But if you are as perceptive as you seem, then surely you've already figured out the riddle. ...The riddle of <textEffects>A'nohn Ihmus's true identity</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, umm... <textEffects>(His true identity? Not sure I know quite yet, but I guess I'll have to answer with something...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...It would seem I am the only one still in the dark here. Would the defense care to enlighten me? Who is this man we've been calling A'nohn Ihmus?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The witness's true identity is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is this really him?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Hmph. Only now do you realize the truth. Well? Please do share with us your belated insight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm...
</line><line>Maya:
What's wrong, Nick? Just say it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because this isn't going to be very helpful to our case...
</line><line>Maya:
Really?! Are you sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Unfortunately, I've got no other choice.)</textEffects> That scruffy beard and shaggy mane completely threw me off. But it's all becoming clear now. The nighttime B.A.S.E. jump from the mountaintop prison... The precision landing at the Inner Sanctum using only a homemade parachute...
</line><line>Ihmus:
.....................
</line><line>Phoenix:
Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is <textEffects>Datz Are'bal</textEffects> -- <textEffects>prison escapee</textEffects> and key member of Dhurke's rebel group!
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Ihmus:
GAAAH-HAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Judge:
The witness is an escaped prisoner?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Precisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time.
</line><line>Ihmus:
Hoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Boy, do I hate this guy...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Please recall the defense's own words...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, "<textEffects>Do not perform the rite.</textEffects>" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.
</line><line>Judge:
Who do you suppose sent that letter?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A person with something to hide -- <textEffects>the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects> herself!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nahyuta:
He claimed that the real killer was "<textEffects>the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>."
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, and what's your point?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
What of the witness's true identity?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is <textEffects>Datz Are'bal</textEffects> -- <textEffects>prison escapee</textEffects> and key member of Dhurke's rebel group!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
*gasp* Oh no!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
He is a <textEffects>rebel</textEffects> and an <textEffects>escaped prisoner</textEffects>. He <textEffects>could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>, mortal enemy of the rebels!
</line><line>Maya:
Nooooooooooo!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this. 
</line><line>Ihmus:
Hoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the <textEffects>razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons</textEffects>!
</line><line>Datz:
...<textEffects>Datz Are'bal</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
When did you get your memory back?
</line><line>Datz:
Oh, around the time you guys were talking about there being <textEffects>no wind</textEffects>. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you prepared to tell us the truth now?
</line><line>Datz:
Well, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, <textEffects>all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A big fat LIIIIIIEE?!
</line><line>Datz:
Oh, and by the way! Long time no see... <textEffects>Yuty</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.........
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait... They know each other?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Your Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once!
</line><line>Datz:
Seems ya really have forgotten <textEffects>the will of the dragon</textEffects>, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Deploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The escaped prisoner... escaped again.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long.
</line><line>Maya:
An escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He really pulled a number on all of us. <textEffects>(What was the point of all that, anyway?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe.
</line><line>Judge:
What makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Datz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
These appear to be <textEffects>direct orders from Dhurke</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
From Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait, I remember now...!)</textEffects> Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before!
</line><line>Judge:
You have?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
And this is...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
..................... I can't read Khura'inese.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well? Wh-What does it say?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Using the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape.
</line><line>Judge:
What?! That is how he was to escape from prison?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
O foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? B-But I didn't say anything. <textEffects>(D-Did he just read my mind?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-How can you be so sure?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
If only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked <textEffects>without the help of a certain individual</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I am speaking of <textEffects>Abbot Inmee</textEffects>, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AUGH!
</line><line>Judge:
S-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom.
</line><line>Judge:
How could this be?!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Hrnh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-This hardly seems fair.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
It is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead?
</line><line>Judge:
Besides the water itself... there is nothing but the <textEffects>warbaa'd statue</textEffects>.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Precisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the Séance is the <textEffects>warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The accused wanted the <textEffects>false Lady Kee'ra</textEffects> to appear in the Séance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip.
</line><line>Judge:
But why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
To show it to the victim as he was being slain.
</line><line>Judge:
And what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
It was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself.
</line><line>Judge:
Come again?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Suspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was <textEffects>a third party in disguise</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Are... Are you saying...?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which <textEffects>she sought to use the Séance vision to mislead us</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This can't be happening!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
What a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a <textEffects>deluded fantasy</textEffects>?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh...Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a 
deluded fantasy.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
It... It can't be--!
</line><line>Judge:
This is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination Séance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?!
</line><line>Maya:
N-No! I did nothing of the sort!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! It's not true! I... I didn't...!
</line><line>Nahyuta:

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Cease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. It seems this trial is over. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Judge:
Does the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... <textEffects>(Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
It would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, I shall now render my verdict.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
It is time to let it go, and move on.
</line><line>Judge:
This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... 
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>Guilty</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Bailiff:Your Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but...</captions>
<line>Judge:
What is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Bailiff:
A <textEffects>body</textEffects> has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...What's this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A body? What happened now?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bailiff:
And we found this sticking out of the victim.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Why that's... <textEffects>Warbaa'd Dagger</textEffects>!
</line><line>Gallery:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Lady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels!</captions>
<line>Judge:
Peace!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Well, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found.
</line><line>Bailiff:
I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Yes?
</line><line>Bailiff:
This dagger... It bears the <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> of Maya Fey on it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHA-HAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Maya:
B-But...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why would Maya's prints be on it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true...
</line><line>Judge:
Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
This trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing. You claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the <textEffects>rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I did say something to that effect, but what of it?
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I believe the true identity of the <textEffects>rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra</textEffects>... ...is none other than the accused, <textEffects>Ms. Maya Fey</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Maya:
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted <textEffects>about two years ago</textEffects>. And the accused first came to our kingdom <textEffects>two years ago</textEffects> as well.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Why, the timing matches perfectly!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
But there is more... That warning letter was found in the <textEffects>high priest's bedroom</textEffects> three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
How does that prove anything?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:

</line><line>Nahyuta:
It is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nahyuta:
The accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nooooooooooooooo!
</line><line><textEffects>Lady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
If we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her <textEffects>motive</textEffects> for killing the high priest.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, the victim was secretly an <textEffects>insurgent</textEffects>, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Precisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then <textEffects>unleashed her divine justice on another rebel</textEffects>. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... <textEffects>two murders</textEffects> perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra.
</line><line>Judge:
.................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
As you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this <textEffects>second murder</textEffects>. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
It seems the defense will live to see one more day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Talk about "hanging on by a thread"...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you.
</line><line>Judge:
I hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned!
