Well, since we've come all this way, why don't we go see Mr. Meekins?

No one's here today... Not even Ms. Starr.
</line><line>Ema:
Everyone's probably busy looking into what exactly went down in the evidence room. That must be where the detectives are.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But we proved in court today that no one was murdered in the evidence room at 5:15 PM, on the day of the crime.
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah. I thought we were finally making some headway in our case!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But instead it looks like we just ended up making Lana look even more guilty.
</line><line>Ema:
Hang in there, Lana...

Howdy, Bambina.

Oh, Mr. Marshall!
</line><line>Marshall:
I never thought things'd turn out this way when I woke up this morning. Que serà serà. You never know where life'll lead you, eh Bambina? I should've known my luck had run out when ol' Billy dried up this morning.
</line><line>Ema:
Billy...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Must be his pet cactus. Say, where are you headed?
</line><line>Marshall:
Just over to the Prosecutor's Office for a little interrogation. It's a "voluntary" appearance, but we all know I won't be coming back. Sorry, but you can't go in the evidence room today, pardner.
</line><line>Ema:
But Mr. Marshall... Why did you do it?
</line><line>Marshall:
Why do prospectors head west? If ever there was a case I needed to know the truth about, it was that one.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Before you turn yourself in, Mr. Marshall... would you mind telling us exactly what happened?
</line><line>Marshall:
Hmph... Looks like I won't be getting a steak lunch today.

So there you have it. That's my story. Did you enjoy it, pardner?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was certainly... enlightening.
</line><line>Marshall:
There's one thing for sure I found out in court today. That boy Edgeworth isn't my enemy. He was the one who used falsified evidence to get a guilty verdict, but someone else was the one who gave him that evidence and planned everything. That someone is Damon Gant. Don't believe me? Well I don't blame you. I won't even be a patrolman after today. Too bad I won't be around to work with you... when you become a real scientific investigator. Adios Bambina!

Falsifying evidence... I didn't think you were the type.

Criminals don't mind playing foul, why should we?

Believe me... I understand the risks.

Lana. Ema told me about you.

Oh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
About how you were a <textEffects>detective</textEffects> two years ago, and how the SL-9 Incident was the reason for your transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
</line><line>Lana:
That's right.

Could you fill me in on the details? Especially about that unusual change of jobs.

Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?
</line><line>Lana:
That's right. Quite a coincidence, hmm?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't buy it.
</line><line>Ema:
W-what are you saying?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by "chance."
</line><line>Ema:
But that case was solved two years ago!
</line><line>Phoenix:
At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.
</line><line>Lana:
Officer Marshall... Yes, his actions came as a surprise to me as well. Ever since his brother died, he's changed completely.
</line><line>Ema:
I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.
</line><line>Lana:
... Life doesn't end with the closing of a case. Everyone has to live the rest of their lives with their memories.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That "case" just might not be over yet.
</line><line>Lana:!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema was assaulted by Darke at the Police Department, right?
</line><line>Lana:
Yes, in the office that Damon Gant and I shared. The office that Mr. Gant now occupies by himself: <textEffects>the Chief's office</textEffects>.

Oh, if you're looking for the others, they're all in the conference room.

With the Chief Prosecutor saying what she did and the decision about what to do about Mr. Edgeworth, not to mention our statement to the media and tomorrow's trial... there's more chaos going on than Thanksgiving and Christmas put together!

Just head across the hall to the other building and take the elevator to the top floor.

Really? You mean, it's okay for us to go in there? I mean, we aren't police officers or anything.

Hey, you're right! You can't go in there! It's off limits!

Check out that pipe organ. That's real, isn't it?
</line><line>Ema:
Hey, I used to take organ lessons in kindergarten! They used to call me "Little Miss Bach." I thought I was a genius until they tried teaching me notes. I never could remember where C was...
</line><line>Gant:
Hm? Oh, it's you two.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Chief Gant! <textEffects>(He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gant:
So, Mr. Wright. Have you been swimming lately?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... no, I haven't. I've been kind of busy lately.
</line><line>Gant:
I can appreciate that. I've had my hands full too, with Mr. Marshall's misconduct and Lana's provocative statement.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Provocative statement"... oh, you mean about the forged evidence.
</line><line>Gant:
Two years have passed since that incident. My, how time flies! See that big picture on the wall over there? That's a picture of Lana, Neil and me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So this is Mr. Marshall's brother... Prosecutor Neil Marshall...)</textEffects>

Anyway, I'd like to reminisce all day, but there are matters that need my attention. I'm going to lock up here, so let's go out together.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh... But this office... it was a crime scene two years ago, wasn't it?
</line><line>Gant:
That case has long since been over. There's no need to investigate it any more.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All the same, we'd still like to have a look around.
</line><line>Gant:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said there's no need to investigate it any more.

...!

Now hurry up and get out. I have a meeting to attend.

It seems that case isn't over with yet, after all.
</line><line>Ema:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Chief Gant denied our request to search the "crime scene." That means there must be a reason he doesn't want us looking around in there.

That sounds serious...

Is it because of what my sister said?

That's basically what it all boils down to. That falsified evidence two years ago. Now Mr. Edgeworth has the whole world after his blood!

Well, there you have it in a nutshell. That's all I know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Can I ask you one more thing?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What is it? If it's money you need, you should ask Chief Gant.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not money, but it does concern the Chief. His office is a "crime scene," right? It's where Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered...
</line><line>Ema:
The Chief's out now, and his office is locked, but we'd like to have a look around if that's okay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Well, any Detective's ID card can unlock the door.
</line><line>Ema:
What? Really!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But if I let a civilian in there, I'd be charged with breach of trust.

Breach of trust...?

Simply put, I'd be canned.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I don't plan on getting fired because of you.
</line><line>Ema:
How about this ID card? It was Detective Goodman's...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That won't work either. The data was deleted the day he died.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So in other words, Gumshoe is our only chance of getting into that office.)</textEffects>

Everyone in this trial was involved in the SL-9 Incident. Not only that, but the murder occurred on the very day the evidence from that case was due for transferal. This can't all be attributed to mere "coincidence."

Look, pal! If I've told you once I've told you a thousand times...

<line>Gumshoe:
The Chief's office is off limits! But no, you just had to go sneaking in there like that, didn't you!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I thought you said you didn't care anymore if you were fired.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, but if I knew it'd be like this, I never would've said it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now that I've seen the evidence Chief Gant was hiding in his office... I think I'm finally starting to get the picture... It's hard to believe anyone could keep quiet about it all this time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Anyway, you listenin' to me!? I'm gonna try to smooth things over with the Chief again! Later, pal!

<line>Phoenix:
After that, I heard from Ema. She said the police want to ask her some questions, so she'll be busy for the rest of the day...

<line>Lana:
I see. So the Chief asked Ema to come in for questioning...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's no use thinking about it. Tomorrow's the final day in court. I'm committed to doing everything I can to defend you, which is why I'm here.
</line><line>Lana:
But I've already told you all I can...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What you've told me over these past couple of days... is absolutely nothing. Not a single, useful thing.
</line><line>Lana:
Really? I believe I did mention something quite important. Something I told you right at the beginning. I said that I was the one who stabbed Detective Goodman.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know, I think I've finally figured it out... Who it is you're hiding behind those words.
</line><line>Lana:
... Mia did a good job mentoring you. I'm rather jealous...
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Lana:
It seems Edgeworth was right.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Lana:
Once you're convinced you know something, no one can persuade you otherwise. "Thick headed" is the term he used, I believe.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now's my chance to get her to tell me the rest of the story!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Skye?
</line><line>Lana:
... Mr. Wright. You are addressing the Chief Prosecutor. Do not forget your place.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I take it she's still not ready to spill the beans.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lana:
My apologies. Could you please tell me a bit more about the circumstances?
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office. This jar piece, and this strip of cloth. Do you know what these are? They're pieces of evidence from the SL-9 Incident!
</line><line>Lana:
I...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
</line><line>Lana:
... Touché, Mr. Wright. It's as you surmised. I cannot disobey the Chief's orders... even if it means being found guilty for murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why not?
</line><line>Lana:
Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't possibly expect me to be able to tell you that. Three days ago... I had no choice but to cooperate.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(In the murder of Detective Goodman!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lana:
Or perhaps I should say, "follow orders." Yes, that's more accurate than "cooperate."

<line>Lana:
It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago. It was over with. I didn't ever want it to be opened again. My intent was to prevent that by whatever means possible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... you hid Darke's knife?
</line><line>Lana:
The weapon used to stab the detective was evidence in the Joe Darke case... If word got out, which it would, the reporters would have a field day with that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe...
</line><line>Lana:
Right. Then I called my sister, to tell her what happened, and to ask her to hide the knife that was inside my muffler.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You asked Ema?
</line><line>Lana:
I didn't want anyone on the force to know about this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lana:
Speaking of phone calls, I had a bad feeling about one of them that day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A bad feeling?
</line><line>Lana:
The truth is, after I received those orders from Chief Gant. The first thing I did was make a phone call. A phone call to Patrolman Jake Marshall.
</line><line>Phoenix:
To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
</line><line>Lana:
The lead investigator for the SL-9 Incident had been murdered. I wanted that fact to be kept hidden, and I needed help. He was the only other person I could trust. Or at least, I thought I could trust him at the time. However, it seems that after I spoke to him he went off on an escapade of his own...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh! You mean...
</line><line>Lana:
Not wanting the case to die, he decided to take things into his own hands.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lana:
He had already stolen the ID card... but it seems he still hadn't made up his mind to break into the evidence room. After my phone call, any remaining doubts he had must have disappeared.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lana:
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Lana...
</line><line>Lana:
You've earned my respect, Mr. Wright. Both as a defense attorney and an investigator. Now please... Don't pursue this any further in court tomorrow!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)</textEffects>
