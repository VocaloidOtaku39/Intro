<line>Apollo:
What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this "mastermind"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are.
</line><line>Apollo:
So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb.
</line><line>Apollo:
So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called "benefactor," too?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya.
</line><line>Apollo:
I wonder who they could be.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's her. Why do you ask?
</line><line>Dhurke:
I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I'm afraid you've lost me.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all.
</line><line>Apollo:
Dhurke, you mind filling us in?
</line><line>Phone:

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>..........................................</textEffects></captions>

Phoenix:
...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling?
</line><line>Phone:
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>*beep*</textEffects></captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
Hello?
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-Who is this?
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... "benefactor."</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Where's Maya?! Is she safe?!
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me!
</line><line>Dhurke:
...Wright, give it here a sec.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait!
</line><line>Dhurke:
Hey, there. How's it going, stranger?
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...Who is this?</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-Inga?!
</line><line>Apollo:
What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya's kidnapper...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice?
</line><line>Inga:
<textEffects>Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?!</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&amp;R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally.
</line><line>Inga:
<textEffects>Ugh!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What is he talking about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye.
</line><line>Inga:
<textEffects>...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke.</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
What?
</line><line>Inga:
<textEffects>I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right?</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
! ............
</line><line>Inga:
<textEffects>Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back.</textEffects>
</line><line>Dhurke:
.........
</line><line>Apollo:
Dh-Dhurke, what's going on?
</line><line>Dhurke:
You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! Why?!
</line><line>Dhurke:
No time to explain.
</line><line>Apollo:
But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane.
</line><line>???:
Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Taking care of the hostage situation.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Wow. <textEffects>(Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Right.
</line><line>Athena:
I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help!
</line><line>Trucy:
No fair! I wanna go, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort.
</line><line>Trucy:
But Daddy!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.)</textEffects> ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me?
</line><line><textEffects>Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy.</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... 
</line>

<line>Apollo:
That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... <textEffects>(The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hurry up, Apollo! 
</line><line>Apollo:
Right behind you!
</line><line>Dhurke:
Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there.
</line><line>Athena: 
Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
S-Sure, no sweat!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks, Edgeworth.

<line>Apollo:
*{huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.
</line><line>Dhurke:
See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated?
</line><line>Dhurke:
Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on
</line><line>Apollo:
It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here.
</line><line>???:
So, you have returned... Barbed Head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga?
</line><line>Rayfa:
If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something?
</line><line>Rayfa:
No, he was alone. Why do you ask?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
You hear that? I think we have company.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">*stomp, stomp, stomp*</captions>
<line>Royal Guard:
Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Q-Queen Ga'ran!
</line><line>Ga'ran:
............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once!
</line><line>Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's she doing? Is she going to help us?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Excuse me, Your Eminence...
</line><line>Ga'ran:
So, our "Barbed Head" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, you may!
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, um... no need to apologize for him!
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Father... abducted someone?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other.
</line><line>Apollo:
Royal guard?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects.
</line><line>Apollo:
And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaat?! Y-You mean...?
</line><line>Dhurke:
Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there!
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?!
</line><line>Dhurke:
Listen, we need to call a truce for now!
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown!
</line><line>Royal Guard:
As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie!
</line><line>Apollo:
W-Wait a second!

</line><line>Dhurke:
Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead.
</line><line>Ga'ran:
...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you?
</line><line>Dhurke:
We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me...
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation?
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaat?! M-Me?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!)</textEffects>

It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in.
</line><line>Apollo:
Umm, can't you wait just a little longer?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi!
</line><line>Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence!
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too?
</line><line>Ga'ran:
Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both!

Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminenece! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan!

<textEffects>(Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.)</textEffects>

Apollo! What happened?!
</line><line>Apollo:
......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga.
</line><line>Athena:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey?
</line><line>Apollo:
Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now...
</line><line>Rayfa:
M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself!

Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass!

...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo.

<textEffects>(He's right. I can't go to pieces now!)</textEffects> Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine!

<line>Edgeworth:
Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here.
</line><line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga.
</line><line>Apollo:
H-He has?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Thank you. <textEffects>(I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! What's she doing here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
So what now, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. Then I will accompany Wright.
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number.
</line><line>Athena:
Do you know your way around here, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost.

Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you?

Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you?

Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though.

I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty.
</line><line>Dhurke:
They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution.

It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney?

What?! But that would mean...

You bet there is. He's your father!

Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.........The past is the past.
</line><line>Dhurke:
What do you mean? Why are you doing this?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms.

So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen.
</line><line>Athena:
Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara?

Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it.

Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, more than ten years, in fact.
</line><line>Ema:
Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Apollo:
P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is.
</line><line>Athena:
Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you.
</line><line>Ema:
You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.

Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a <textEffects>locked-room murder</textEffects>. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside.

Right. In addition... ...we also know that <textEffects>Dhurke's fingerprints</textEffects> are all over the murder weapon. 
</line><line>Athena:
The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind.

Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened.

Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left.

Apollo, remember how Inga said he had "someone dear to Dhurke"? Why don't you ask about that?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, right. I'll give it a try.
</line>



<line>Apollo:
...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, "<textEffects>But she's gone now</textEffects>." And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right?
</line><line>Dhurke:
I keep telling you, there's no other woman!
</line><line>Apollo:
Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve?
</line><line>Dhurke:
...It's just this. Satisfied?

See? I wasn't trying to hide anything.

</line><line>Athena:
Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, you're right.
</line><line>Athena:
Aww. That's no fun.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before?
</line><line>Athena:
.........Now that you mention it...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.
</line><line>Dhurke:
A-Apollo, where did you get this?
</line><line>Apollo:
From the safe in Inga's room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. <textEffects>Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until <textEffects>AFTER Amara was assassinated</textEffects>.
</line><line>Dhurke:
Gnrk!
</line><line>Apollo:
...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive?

..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me?
