Athena:
<textEffects>(Ugh. My butterflies have butterflies in their stomach.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
So, what's it like to have your very own case for the first time?
</line><line>Athena:
My heart hasn't raced this fast since I ran that full marathon last year.
</line><line>Apollo:
If it keeps up, you might get a lawyer's high -- you know like a runner's high?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Relax, everyone's nervous their first time.
</line><line>Means:
So my fears weren't unfounded. After all, today's prosecutor is so terribly brutal... ...and willing to use any means necessary to win a conviction.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(There's that the-end-justifies-the-means concept again.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Now that it has come to this... ...we have no choice but to fight fire with fire. <textEffects>The end justifies the means.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I wish he'd stop saying that.)</textEffects> That's your method, Professor. I'm going to defend Juniper in my own way.
</line><line>Means:
But, Ms. Cykes. Just yesterday you told me...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Means:
As a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?
</line><line>Athena:
Heh heh! That's an easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!
</line><line>Means:
My, but aren't you a stubborn one. Well, I suppose you will have to learn of your own inefficacy the hard way.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Grrrrrrr...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Forgive me, Prof. Means, but can we just leave it at that?
</line><line>Means:
Oh, dear, please forgive me. It's just, I wish to protect Juniper by any means I can.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I do, too, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Now, if you would excuse me...
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh! Thanks to him, I'm feeling even more pressure than before.
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't let it get to you, Athena. And don't forget to keep smiling.
</line><line>Athena:
I'll be fine! And I haven't forgotten what Mr. Wright said! "<textEffects>The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Bailiff:
The trial is about to begin. I'll show you to the courtroom if you please.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Apollo, I'm counting on you to support Athena this time.
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, Mr. Wright! Leave it to me!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(That's right. I have Apollo to back me up. Junie's fate rests in my hands. I won't rest until she walks free!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>October 25, 10:00 AM
District Court - Courtroom No. 4</textEffects></center><line>
</line><center><b>Day 1</b></center>
<center><b>Court Is Now In Session</b></center>
<center><b>All Rise</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.
</line><line>Athena:
A-Athena Cykes, d-defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor!
</line><line>Apollo:
That didn't sound very confident. You sure you're okay?
</line><line>Athena:
I'll... I'll be fine!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Your Baldness.
</line><line>Judge:
I know, I know. As usual, you want me to deliver the opening statement. Agh!
</line><line>Blackquill:
This case is crystal clear. I see no need to explicate it any further. ...Now, summon the witness.
</line><line>Judge:
.........
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........Is there something the matter? Please do share, Your Baldness.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Bailiff, please call our first witness!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(And now we don't even get an opening statement...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Detective Fulbright... He and Prosecutor Blackquill have become quite the team.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........
</line><line>Fulbright:
Oh, right! The case brief! Leave it to me! Yes, let the detective in charge, everyone's favorite friend of justice, explain!
</line><line>Apollo:
What was THAT just now...? It's like he and Blackquill are totally in sync.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I don't think they're capable of mind melding, if that's what you're thinking.
</line><line>Judge:
All right, Detective Fulbright. Would you please explain the case to the court?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Prof. Courte's body was discovered on October 24th at approximately 2:30 PM. She was murdered with this awl I have here! The victim's blood and the defendant's prints were both discovered on it!
</line><line><textEffects>Awl added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
EEEK!
</line><line><textEffects>Courte's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Wow, that bird can deliver evidence, too? Blackquill has trained him well.
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe Blackquill should train it not to mess up people's hair while he's at it.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Moving right along! The body was discovered on the outdoor stage, although no blood was found there! However, we detected traces of a massive amount of blood in the third floor art room. In short, the murder took place in the <textEffects>art room</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
So, the body had been moved from the art room to the stage?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Precisely! And there is one more piece of irrefutable evidence! A recording made by a tape recorder that a school paper reporter hid in the art room! It captured a female voice screaming, "<textEffects>You're a goner!</textEffects>"
</line><line>Judge:
What's this?! You have such a recording?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Must be from that tape recorder Myriam mentioned.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(But why is this the first we've heard of a death threat at the moment of the murder?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Shhhhhh! Silence, please! I would like to play the tape for you now.
</line>
<hr />
<line><textEffects>.................................... ...You're a goner!</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... It is quite hard to hear.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(But the voice does sound female...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Tape Recorder added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
The noise and low volume of the voice have made voiceprint analysis all but impossible.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, you haven't identified the voice as belonging to the defendant.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Not so fast. After all, voiceprint analysis isn't everything! The victim was killed at night, then discovered in the afternoon the next day. The question is... when was the body moved!
</line><line>Judge:
............Oh, oh! I know! It could've been moved in the middle of the night when no one was around!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Sorry, but no! The campus was full of students that morning. However, no one reported seeing a body. That means the body was moved sometime before the mock trial when all the students... ...and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall and <textEffects>the rest of the campus was empty</textEffects>! It was during this time Hugh O'Conner, one of the mock trial participants, found the body.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(So the prosecution heard about Hugh seeing the body...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Wait a moment. If all of the students and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall... ...then there wouldn't have been anyone who could've moved the body!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Have no fear, for there is always an exception.
</line><line>Judge:
An exception?
</line><line>Fulbright:
The three mock trial participants were standing by in individual dressing rooms. They were the only ones who had free access to the deserted campus before the mock trial.
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Then that would mean...! ...What would that mean?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Those three students were the only ones who could've moved the body! In justice we trust!
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't like where this is headed, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
Me neither...
</line><line>Fulbright:
And by those three, I mean... ...Hugh O'Conner, Robin Newman, and Juniper Woods.
</line><line>Athena:
I knew it... <textEffects>(Please, Detective Fulbright... Don't say what I think you're about to say...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
In justice we trust! I take it EVERYONE understands now! The voice believed to be that of the murderer was female! And out of the three people who could've moved the body, just one is a girl. That leaves the defendant Juniper Woods as the only possibility!
</line><line>Athena:
Noooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Impressive. He has you on the ropes even before any cross-examinations.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(You could at least pretend to be upset for me.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
A splendid job, Fool Bright. That could not be any clearer. Feel free to anticipate a salary raise next month.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha ha! I don't do this for the money. It's all about justice! In justice we trust!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Not only a halfwit, but a perennial stick-in-the-mud you are.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I guess neither the carrot nor the stick works on Detective Fulbright.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, Bailiff, please bring our next witness to the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Scuttlebutt:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
So... our first witness... is a cardboard box?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
......... Kaaahk! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss...! Stealth mode deactivated!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! The box has hands!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Smile, Your Honor. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!
</line><line>Judge:
What the dickens?! I've just had my picture taken!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Myriam Scuttlebutt. Senior at the legal academy. I'm a reporter on the judge course. Juniper's been a bad, bad girl. I'll tell you all about her crime, sss, sss, sss!
</line><line>Judge:
...Umm, might I ask whether you could come out of that box?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
How will I get any more scoops if I blow my cover? So, the answer is no. After all, covert action is an undercover reporter's bread and butter!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But testimony from a faceless witness is highly irregular.
</line><line>Blackquill:
A former ninja I met in the clink said that exposing those who work in the shadows... ...is to pass the death sentence upon them.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! I had never thought of it that way. Very well, if it would spare a life, I'll make a special exception this time.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(A former ninja in prison? Holy shinto! How can the judge believe this load of crock?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, your testimony please. Oh, but take care not to reveal your face.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --</textEffects></center>
<line>Scuttlebutt:
The murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.
Up until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's contents.
But Prof. Courte's sudden decision not to use the script sparked Juniper's murderous rage.
Juniper has to be the killer. She has a motive and the murder is just like her script.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The murder is just like her script?! Could such a thing be true?!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Compare her script with the murder case and crime scene photos. Then you'll see!
</line><line>Blackquill:
This is so simple, even an ape posing as a decrepit old judge could understand. Only the victim and the defendant were privy to the script. Ergo, the defendant is the killer. Furthermore, in the art room where the crime supposedly occurred, this witness's script... ...along with an envelope on which "Use" was written were found. This proves that the accused's script had been rejected the day before the mock trial. She pressed the victim to use her script, an argument ensued, and then the fatal stabbing.
</line><line>Athena:
*gulp* <textEffects>(That makes perfect sense. What now?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Blackquill has all his ducks lined up in a row. He's really on a roll now.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh. He's like a pit bull once it sinks its teeth into you.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
How dare she! My script had it all! A bum rap and phony evidence! Grudges and betrayals!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I trust the defense is ready to cross-examine the witness?
</line><line>Athena:
N-No problem! I-I mean, yes I'm ready... I think... <textEffects>(Time to find a hole in her testimony, and unbox the truth! I've seen it done over and over. I know I can do this!)</textEffects>
</line>

<center><textEffects>-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --</textEffects></center>
<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>The murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>Up until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's contents.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:

</line>

<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Anyone can see the similarities between the script and this case. But that doesn't mean Junie's the killer!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
I know it's frustrating, Athena, but we don't have much to go on at this point. All you can do is relentlessly press the witness and hope you find a hole.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, got it! <textEffects>(Press relentlessly! Right!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>After pressing first and fourth statements:</i>
</line><line>Judge:
I believe you've pressed the witness more than enough, Ms. Cykes.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Now do you see how clear-cut my case is? Take it now, and in that fair, desperate mind of yours... ...etch it deep so you may never forget!
</line><line>Athena:
N-No... Nooooooooooooooo! <textEffects>(Even my arguments get thrown back in my face. It wasn't supposed to be like this. What am I going to do?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...Athena. You should just about have all the answers you've been looking for now.
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?
</line><line>Apollo:
Think about it this way: If the killer knew the details of the mock trial... ...would they really commit the crime in the exact same way?
</line><line>Athena:
I don't follow.
</line><line>Apollo:
Try to place yourself in the killer's shoes. I bet you'll discover an <textEffects>inconsistency</textEffects> if you do.
</line><line>Athena:
.........Ah! I get it! Thanks, Apollo! Ms. Scuttlebutt! Just so we're clear, you're claiming... ...that the killer INTENTIONALLY made the crime scene just as it was in the script... ...and that it is beyond the shadow of a doubt NOT a coincidence. Is that correct?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
No duh! After all, it's just more evidence of Juniper's evil she-devil ways.
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk! Wh-What'd I say, what'd I say?!
</line><line>Athena:
Our client made the crime scene look just like the script, something known only to her? That would be not just foolhardy, but completely irrational!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Ms. Cykes. Please tell this court what you mean by "irrational."
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
The murder scene was the same as it was in the mock trial script. That in and of itself is irrational!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk! What's wrong with them being the same?!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Ms. Cykes. Care to explain what you mean?
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, let's say for argument's sake, that Ms. Woods is the killer. If so, then... ...what reason would she have to intentionally make the actual murder mimic her own script?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
That's easy! She was admitting that she was the-- Ah!
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. If she had really done that... ...it would've been like proclaiming to the world that she was the killer! So, what we ACTUALLY have here is evidence of someone trying to frame our client!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk... Kaaahk kahk-kahk!
</line><line>Athena:
The body was found on the day of the mock trial, in short, the day the details were revealed. So it would be completely inconceivable for the murder to go exactly like the script!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk! Don't let it go to your head just yet!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. It would seem Justice-dono's comrade in arms has finally drawn her sword. However, the blade is dull, and it shall remain so until you master its use.
</line><line>Athena:
E-Enough with the stupid sword metaphors, already!
</line><line>Blackquill:
There is a perfectly good reason for the inconsistency of which you speak.
</line><line>Athena:
R-Reason? What reason?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Must I spell out everything? Hmph, you are what people today call "high maintenance." The accused had intended to stop the mock trial. And in that event... ...nary a soul would have been the wiser to the similarities of the case and script.
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
No! The mock trial was only stopped after the body was accidently <i>[sic]</i> discovered!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Our witness here had also discovered the body. In fact, she was led to our dearly departed professor by the accused herself.
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What?! Ms. Scuttlebutt saw the body, too?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Precisely. And with the discovery of the body, the mock trial ought to have been canceled.
</line><line>Athena:
Wait, so you didn't call the police?!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Nope! I kept it secret for my big scoop!
</line><line>Athena:
Y-You can't do that!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. I made her pay long and hard penance for her sin. Did I not, my little box top?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk! Compared to the work of a war correspondent, the sheer terror of that was-- Aaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Apollo:
Jeez, I wonder what the Twisted Samurai did to her.
</line><line>Athena:
...Block off all the holes in her box... ...and spin her like a top while Detective Fulbright cackled in delight?
</line><line>Apollo:
...That sounds more nauseating than scary.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Enough jabbering. Witness! Continue your testimony!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss... Sure, Mr. Samurai. I'm ready to finish off that she-devil!

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --</textEffects></center>
<line>Scuttlebutt:
I snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.
Juniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, "What are you doing?"
When suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.
I followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!
I'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!

</line><line>Athena:
Why did you withhold such key testimony?!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kaaahk! Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!
</line><line>Apollo:
A-Athena! You haven't even started your cross-examination.
</line><line>Athena:
I know, but her testimony points to her as being a potential suspect!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill is-- No, wait, I bet he's already thought of that.
</line><line>Athena:
The witness left the Lecture Hall to sneak into Ms. Woods's room before the mock trial. That means she, too, could have moved the victim's body!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kaaaaaahk!
</line><line>Athena:
The prosecution's claim no longer has any ground to stand on! Heeeeeelp!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Now, now, no need to ruffle your own feathers so. When you squeak like a little brat, it agitates Taka. Do you want him to peck your eyes out?
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>No, thanks!</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
You listen here. The witness has a perfectly good alibi.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Oh, yeah, I do! Around the estimated time of death... ...I was at undercover reporter class. It's right near my home!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Undercover reporter class?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
The proverbial rug has been pulled from under you. The witness could not be the killer.
</line><line>Judge:
The defense must look before leaping -- or at least make sure the rug's secured to the floor.
</line><line>Apollo:
I tried to warn you.
</line><line>Athena:
Oooh...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Well, there ends the cross-examination. Let's allow the witness to step down.
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? N-No, wait a minute...
</line><line>Blackquill:
The defense has no right to cross-examine the witness after that little spectacle. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh. <textEffects>(Why can't he say, "You reap what you sow"?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well, if the cross-examination is over, I suppose the witness may go home. Perhaps spend some time in her lovely box and recover from today's stressful events.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss! Don't you worry about me, Your Honor! There's no rest for the wicked... or journalists, either! My third eye's always eyeing a scoop!
</line><line>Apollo:
She's always eyeing a scoop...?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:

</line><line>Apollo:
Not so fast, Ms. Scuttlebutt!
</line><line>Athena:
A-Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
There's... just one thing I'd like to ask. Did you take a picture of the victim's body, and if not, why not?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
I, well... that is... No... I-I didn't take one.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, that's strange... Why wouldn't you take a picture if you're always eyeing a scoop?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk!
</line><line>Apollo:
Did you or didn't you really see the victim's body?!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk! Er... it's not like I, uh... actually SAW it, saw it, but...
</line><line>Blackquill:
What the devil?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Did you hear that, Your Honor? The witness didn't actually see the body! That completely overturns the prosecution's claim that the witness was led to it!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Justice-dono! You dare bare steel at me again?!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss! Nice try, boy wonder! So what if I didn't see the body? The fact remains that Juniper led me there. Feast your eyes on this!
</line><line>Apollo:
What exactly am I looking at here?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss! It's a crucial moment forever frozen in time by my third eye. A photo clearly showing Juniper Woods! Kaaaaaahk!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Why did you not tell me of this?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. It's a shocking scoop I was saving for just the right moment. And that would be now, right here in court. Surprise! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss. Kaaaaaaaaaaaahk! What'd I do, what'd I do?! All journalists keep their scoops secret until the right moment!
</line><line>Apollo:
She's pretty brave hiding it from Blackquill like that.
</line><line>Athena:
Or pretty stupid. ...Well, this is an unexpected turn.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Um, Athena? About this picture... See how it only shows the back of the subject?
</line><line>Athena:
Ah! So, then...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Right, who knows whether this photo Juniper in the first place!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. A completely irrelevant point. What IS relevant here is... ...there was someone who did try to lead the witness to the body. Take a gander at this -- the route by which the accused escaped. The witness pursued the accused this way, after she fled the dressing room. The accused descended to the first floor and exited to the quad. Then what, Carton Cretin?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Then I... tripped and fell. Caught my knee on my own box.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(She stayed under the box, even while running after someone? Sounds difficult...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Recall that the body was already there, for Hugh O'Conner had already seen it. She was trying to show someone the body because she wanted to stop the mock trial!
</line><line>Athena:
Hrgh!
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
But if the facts have changed, that's all the more reason to cross-examine the witness!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point there. Very well, you may proceed with your cross-examination.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph! It seems Justice-dono has saved your pretty little hide, missy. ...For now, at least.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Whew. Guess I pulled that off somehow.
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks, Apollo. You're a lifesaver.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Incidentally, my compliments to the witness for her very fine box.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss! It's primo cardboard, lovingly selected from among many-- Kahk!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Tell another lie or hide another fact from me... ...and I shall put it to the torch!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk... Kaaaaaahk! P-P-Please, anything but that!
</line><line>Judge:
I think it would be more eco-friendly to recycle it, but that's just me. All right, Ms. Cykes. You may cross-examine the witness.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --</textEffects></center>
<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>I snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>Juniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, "What are you doing?"</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>When suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>I followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
<textEffects>I'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
She keeps saying that it was Junie, but she didn't even actually see the body.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but Blackquill's assertion takes that into account.
</line><line>Athena:
So, even if I press her on never seeing the body... ...I won't be able to overturn this testimony.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, whoever it was that was fleeing, Myriam never did see their face. So, I'm wondering <textEffects>why she thought it was Juniper</textEffects>. Try thinking along that line and see what you can come up with.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Ms. Scuttlebutt's sole basis for identifying our client as the figure in this photo... ...is the fact that it shows someone in Ms. Woods's stage costume.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. Well, it IS Juniper's costume. So that must be Juniper in it. It's clear-cut.
</line><line>Athena:
No, that's where you're completely mistaken!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Whaaat?!
</line><line>Athena:
This is a design drawing of our client's stage costume.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my, what a wonderful creation! The constellations are extraordinary.
</line><line>Athena:
I'm glad you noticed, because those stars are precisely what's important here. In the drawing, there are <textEffects>constellations</textEffects> all over the outside of the costume. But there's <textEffects>not a single star</textEffects> on the costume in the photo!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Oh, then that means... Uh... What exactly?
</line><line>Athena:
Your Honor, there were no other blue costumes at the scene. Which leads me to believe... ...that the figure in the photo was wearing our client's costume inside out.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But why would Ms. Woods make a mistake like that?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, it's not really a matter of <textEffects>why</textEffects>... ...but rather, <textEffects>who</textEffects> made the mistake of putting it on inside out.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk... W-Wait, you're not suggesting...!
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. I'm glad you're catching on. The costume's designer wouldn't put her own costume on inside out!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Kaaaaaaaaaahk!
</line><line>Athena:
Sorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
A f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!
</line><line>Athena:
Why hello, Ms. Scuttlebutt! So nice to meet the woman beneath the box!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Y-- You didn't see nothing!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Now, I would have you stop right there, Cykes-dono. For it is the <textEffects>why</textEffects> of the matter upon which I would have this court focus.
</line><line>Athena:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Ms. Juniper Woods!
</line><line>Woods:
Yes?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What were you doing on the morning of the mock trial?
</line><line>Woods:
I was in my dressing room, *cough* painting my costume in fluorescent paint.
</line><line>Athena:
Fluorescent... paint?
</line><line>Woods:
My design drawing shows twinkling stars on the costume. *cough* *cough* I was going to make the costume shimmer like that by painting the inside fluorescent.
</line><line>Judge:
Fluor... what was that again? Fluoride? Did your costume have cavities?
</line><line>Woods:
Not fluoride -- fluorescent, as in glowing. The paint would make it glow in the dark. *cough*
</line><line>Blackquill:
Yes, yes, so you applied that to the inside of the costume. And then?
</line><line>Woods:
I let it dry for a while because I heard it takes a long time. So I put the costume on my mannequin <textEffects>inside out</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Inside out...? So, then...
</line><line>Blackquill:
This is a photograph of the inside-out costume taken in the dark. As you can see, there is a heavy layer of paint over the entire inside surface. If someone were to properly don this costume in this state... ...the wet paint would get all over their body.
</line><line>Judge:
...Why, yes! I believe it would!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Indeed. Ergo, the costume was worn the way it was, not by anyone's mistake... ...but because this was the way it was on the mannequin -- inside out!
</line><line>Athena:
Gah!
</line><line><textEffects>Glowing Costume Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Figures he would have a photo.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh. Did we just fall into his trap?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, I bet Blackquill had it all planned out. Still, I think you should give this photo a nice, long look.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, please tell me you found something that doesn't add up.
</line><line>Apollo:
Check out the chest area. It kinda looks like a <textEffects>hand print</textEffects> to me.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, you're right! But Junie would know better than to touch it while the paint was still wet.
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
I believe the term to describe your thought process is wishful thinking. After all, if master painters make mistakes, why not a rank amateur such as the accused?
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
So basically... you're saying, my claim requires evidence to back it up?
</line><line>Apollo:
Evidence? That shouldn't be a problem, right? After all, you've come this far.
</line><line>Athena:
Just because I've come this far, that doesn't mean I've thought everything through, though...
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! You mean you've just been bluffing?!
</line><line>Athena:
What did you expect me to do?! I'm sick of losing to this guy! But you're right... There's only one thing left to do at this point! And that's to present some evidence! Pronto!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............A showdown, is it? I gladly accept!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(The fluorescent paint must have stuck to the hands of whoever touched the costume. And that paint should glow in dark places... So, I just need to carefully check every last piece of evidence!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This piece of evidence shows who touched the costume!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
A school newspaper?
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Interesting.
</line><line>Athena:
Take a look at the photo where the lights are dimmed and the spotlight is on Ms. Woods. Observe Mr. Newman's hand in that photo as he stands at the prosecutor's bench. As you can see, it's glowing, just like Ms. Woods's fluorescent paint.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It is glowing -- quite brightly I might add.
</line><line>Athena:
But why would he put fluorescent paint on his hand for the mock trial, you may ask? The answer is he wouldn't -- not on purpose. It got there when he put the costume on.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...? I mean, oh! That means...! ......What again?
</line><line>Athena:
It means the figure photographed in the costume was not our client Juniper Woods. It was her classmate, Robin Newman!
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Apollo:
...To think you were actually able to prove that...
</line><line>Athena:
Well, you never know what's going to happen next. That's the thrill of the courtroom!
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm... So, then... ...does that mean that Robin is our man...?
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... Well... That's certainly how it looks...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Very well, Robin Newman it is! He is here in the gallery, I trust? Show yourself! I challenge you to a duel!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Will the witness please state his name and occupation.
</line><line>Newman:
IIIIIIIIIII'M ROBIIIIIIIN NEWMAAAAAAAAN!!! I want to become a great artist! I practice day and night!!! YEAAAAAAH! NOOOOOO! That's not it! Art's gotta be sincere, maaaaaan!!!
</line><line>Judge:
So, for occupation, should we put down ...budding artist?
</line><line>Newman:
NOOOOOO! Themis Legal Academy! Senior! PROSECUTOR COOOURSE! This brace is proof of my masculinity! I've been training to be a prosecutor for 18 years!
</line><line>Judge:
*ahem* I assume you will be cleaning up the pottery you smashed before you leave today.
</line><line>Newman:
.........Aaaaaaaaagh! AWWW, MAAAAAAAAAN!!! Aaaaaaaaagh! Aaagh...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems the witness has finally settled down.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I guess nothing fazes the judge after all these years.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You may proceed with your testimony, Mr. Newman. Specifically, the court wishes to hear why you had fluorescent paint on your hand.

</line><line>Athena:
Your Honor! I recommend a short therapy session for the witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Newman does seem particularly agitated, but...
</line><line>Newman:
Agh! ...Arrrgh! Aaaaaaaaagh! Nooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Not again. What's his problem?
</line><line>Athena:
I sensed it the moment Robin took the stand. ...The <textEffects>discord in his heart</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
So, you think he might be hiding something?
</line><line>Athena:
Probably! You ready, Mr. Newman? Let's see what the Mood Matrix can do for you!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Newman:
<textEffects>I went to see Juniper in her waiting room!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>BUT SHE WASN'T THERE!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>When I walked by that frilly costume, I was like, whoaaaaaa!</textEffects>

<line>Newman:
<textEffects>The mannequin it was on! IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL OVER!!!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>I got the paint on me when I caught it!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>I never put it on! That's just STUUUPID!</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
He had to catch the mannequin as it suddenly started to fall over?
</line><line>Apollo:
Even I can guess this one. The most natural response would be <textEffects>surprise</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Apollo's right, so maybe I should try focusing on some other emotion.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
When you mentioned the stage costume... ...I sensed a sudden, powerful feeling of <textEffects>joy</textEffects>. Would you care to explain, Mr. Newman?
</line><line>Newman:
W-W-Wait?! WHAAAAAAT?! Wh-Why would a frilly scarf-thing and a long skirt make me feel like that?!
</line><line>Athena:
I don't know, but you seem awfully interested in that costume for some reason. You didn't happen to put it on, did you?
</line><line>Newman:
L-Like I'd be into that kinda thing! I'm a dude! I'm into braces, not dresses!
</line><line>Apollo:
You don't think... Robin likes girls' clothes... do you?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, come on! Isn't it obvious?!
</line><line>Apollo:
...You're enjoying this a bit too much, Athena.
</line><line>Newman:
NO WAY, MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! The mannequin came falling toward me, so I stuck out my hands to stop it! End of story!!!
</line><line>Athena:
That's a new piece of information! Time to run an update! <textEffects>(Hmm... Even after that update, something just doesn't feel right here. Do I have anything that could prove his statement contradicts what really happened?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
You said the mannequin came falling toward you, so you stuck your hands out to stop it. If so, then then fingers of your hands would've been pointing <textEffects>outward</textEffects> like this. But that's not what the handprints show. In fact, this looks more like just your <textEffects>thumbs and the base of your palms</textEffects>.
</line><line>Newman:
Wh-Why in the world would I leave such weird handprints?
</line><line>Athena:
You know why! You left them when you went to adjust the scarf after putting it on. Just like the model in the drawing!
</line><line>Newman:
WHOOOOOOA!
</line><line>Athena:
Why don't you admit it, Mr. Newman? You DID put the stage costume on, didn't you? And you really DO like frilly clothes, don't you?
</line><line>Newman:
Fine! I admit to putting the costume on! BUUUUUUT! I DON'T LIKE GIRLY CLOTHES, MAAAN!!!
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>90%</b></center>
<line>
Athena:
Yes! New information to plug in! Time for another update!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Newman:
<textEffects>I snuck in, knowing the costume was in there!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>My heart was pounding, even though I'm a guy.</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>Then I saw it! It was even more amazing than I'd imagined!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>I was like, WHOAAA! I'm a guy, but I got all excited!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Newman:
<textEffects>It's true! I did put on girly clothes!</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
<textEffects>But it was strictly for artistic purposes!</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hopefully, we can figure out what Robin's hiding based on this new information.
</line><line>Apollo:
Just hope it's not more than we bargained for, although that usually seems to be the case.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
There! Another emotion that doesn't fit.
</line><line>Newman:
So what?! You're really starting to get on my nerves, maaaaaan!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Newman, you got excited when you put the costume on... ...but you also felt <textEffects>sad</textEffects>.
</line><line>Newman:
Who cares if I felt sad?! It's no big deaaaaaal!
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, Mr. Newman, out with it! Why did you feel sad?! You're hiding something, aren't you?!
</line><line>Newman:
Ooh! Nooooooooo!
</line><line>Athena:
You're not fooling anyone anymore. Now, tell us why you were sad!
</line><line>Newman:
OKAAAAAY, FIIINE! If you're gonna be that way, I'll tell you!!! The reason I felt sad is... is... is...!!! No matter how much I dress up, I'll never be as pretty as Juniper!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, no offense, but for one thing, he's a guy -- and a real hothead at that.
</line><line>Newman:
NOOOOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S NOT IIIIIIIIIIT! I totally owned those girly clothes! I should've been totally pretty!!! BUT! BUT! THERE'S SOMETHING THAT KEEPS GETTING IN MY WAAAAAAY!!!
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Apollo:
Out-of-control emotions...! We saw those during the Nine-Tales <i>[sic]</i> Vale incident. So, all we have to do is find the <textEffects>source of his uncontrollable anger</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Athena:
Right. Help me look for a <textEffects>conflict</textEffects> between his statements and the images we see. If we can find that we can wrestle him away from whatever's tormenting him. <textEffects>(Mr. Newman said that there's something "getting in the way" of him being pretty.

<line>Apollo:
So, we're looking for the <textEffects>source</textEffects> of his anger?
</line><line>Athena:
Right. The conflict in his testimony will most likely arise from his emotional repression.
</line><line>Athena:
Let's compare the images to his testimony! We might find the problem that way!

<line>Athena:
Mr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you? Is that what you feel is holding you back from being <textEffects>as pretty as you think you should be</textEffects>?
</line><line>Newman:
Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-WHAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Newman! The truth is, you really want to take that brace off, don't you?
</line><line>Newman:
No way maaan! This is a symbol of masculinity! I could never take it off!!!
</line><line>Athena:
Is it that you <textEffects>can't</textEffects> take it off, or that you <textEffects>don't want to</textEffects> take it off?
</line><line>Newman:
Aw, maaaaaaaaaaaan! I shoulda kept my big mouth shut!!!
</line><line>Athena:
......... <textEffects>(This is really weird. He exhibits <span style="color:#E16935">intense anger</textEffects> toward his <textEffects>brace</textEffects>, which he calls a "symbol of masculinity"... ...but he can't take it off, even when dressing like a girl.

</line><line>Apollo:
Athena? You okay?
</line><line>Athena:
It seems Robin is still hiding a secret. A big one.
</line><line>Apollo:
Bigger than the fact that he likes to wear girls' clothes?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, at least I think so.&#160;! <textEffects>(No, it can't be! I just thought of something, but it's totally insane!)</textEffects> Mr. Newman!

Am I just imagining things, or is Robin even more hyper now than when she was a he?

I don't know. Maybe it's because she finally got her troubles off her chest, literally.
</line><line>Judge:
This is all well and good, but does he being a she actually change anything?
</line><line>Athena:
The fact that the witness is a girl does change things. Because there is now a piece of evidence that we must re-evaluate!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well, let's see what the defense has for us now. <textEffects>What piece of evidence must we reconsider now that we know that the witness is a girl?</textEffects>

This is what I'd like the court to reconsider.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, the tape recorder -- the one that recorded the threat, "<textEffects>You're a goner!</textEffects>"
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. And we have already established that it's a female voice in the recording. Of all the students who could've moved the body before the mock was to start... ...our client was the only female if you exclude Ms. Scuttlebutt because of her alibi. And that is why the tape recorder made our client the prime suspect.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... So then...!
</line><line>Athena:
That's right! The witness just revealed that she's a girl! Therefore! If we are using the voice in this recording as the basis for hurling accusations... ...this witness must be labeled a suspect, too!

Oh... Oh, noooooo!

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph! Suspicious is as suspicious does. Undoubtedly, the witness does have some sort of connection to this crime. Perhaps our newfound lady is merely feigning ignorance.

Ms. Woods did not want Hugh O'Conner to win the mock trial. That's why I believe she leaked the details to the witness, Robin Newman.

Here's a shot of the crime scene. Ironically, it was Prof. Courte who posed as the corpse. Herr Forehead, how did the mock trial participants react to this photo?

Mr. Newman was surprised by what Prof. Courte was wearing.

<line>Apollo:
Robin said, "<textEffects>Oh, the green sweat suit.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Newman:
S-U-R-E, I might have said that. But... SO WHHAAATTT?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, think of it this way, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
Y-Yeah. Uh, which way, exactly?
</line><line>Apollo:
If I told you that I'd be wearing a blue suit today... ...but then showed up wearing what I've got on now, what would you say?
</line><line>Athena:
Umm... "Oh, the red suit." Ah! <textEffects>(I-I think I've got it...!)</textEffects> Your Honor! We have evidence proving that Ms. Newman knew the contents of the script. The defense moves to present said evidence to the court!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Ms. Cykes. Present away.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>This evidence proves that Ms. Newman had prior knowledge of the script's contents.</textEffects>

<line>Judge:
...The mock trial's script?
</line><line>Athena:
Ms. Newman, during the mock trial, you were shown a photo of the victim's body... ...and reportedly, you reacted by saying, "<textEffects>Oh, the green sweat suit.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Newman:
Oh, um... Yes, I said that. What's your point?
</line><line>Athena:
You seemed to have some issue with the <textEffects>green sweat suit</textEffects>, and I think I know why. The proof is in the script, specifically on the "Things to Prepare" page. "<textEffects>Sweat suit: Victim's outfit will be a red one from the prosecutor course.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Newman:
Ah!
</line><line>Athena:
You were surprised because the sweat suit in the photo was <textEffects>green</textEffects>. But, if you didn't know about the script's content... Then that shouldn't have surprised you!
</line><line>Newman:
...N-- Noooooooooooooooooo! I thought we were friends, Athena! How could I have been so bliiiiiiiiind!

If knowing script details makes me a suspect... ...then there must be others besides me! I mean, someone else could've also seen Prof. Courte's note!
</line><line>Athena:
Note...? What note?
</line><line>Newman:
The professor and Juniper were working together to prepare for the mock trial. But only one copy of the script was made to prevent it from being leaked. But that gets kind of inconvenient, right?
</line><line>Athena:
You're not seriously going to suggest...!
</line><line>Newman:
Eek! But it's the truth! Prof. Courte did do exactly what you're thinking! She didn't write down any of the proceedings or the truth behind the case... But she did write a note to herself about the props and details about the victim's B-O-D-Y!
</line><line>Athena:
...Is this really true, Ms. Newman?
</line><line>Newman:
If you don't believe me, send the police over to my house! Tell them to check the pictures on my camera. I thought it might give me an advantage... ...so I took a picture of the note!
</line><line>Apollo:
.........I'd say she's telling the truth.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(...Wait a sec!)</textEffects> If there's a note with details about the body, then that means... ...there are others who could have made the murder look like our client's script!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I believe you're right!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph!
</line><line>Athena:
Apparently, this case isn't as clear-cut as Prosecutor Blackquill would have us believe. This new revelation blasts a big fat hole in the prosecution's case!

</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Are you sure, Mr. O'Conner?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. The word of a genius is as good as gold. Let's get on with this. Hugh O'Conner. A senior at Themis Legal Academy, lawyer course. How's that?
</line><line>Judge:
J-Just fine. Your testimony, then... If you please.
</line><line>Apollo:
You're up against the top of the class now. I'd be careful if I were you.
</line><line>Athena:
I know Junie would never lie like that! That pompous schoolboy won't know what hit him!

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Around the Time of the Murder --</textEffects></center>
<line>O'Conner:
To get mentally prepared for the mock trial, I meditated at the archery range till 7:00 PM.
At around, 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper.
We didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self.
That's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Blackquill:
That is quite enough. Well done, Golden Boy.
</line><line>O'Conner:
...Heh.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The final bell rings at <textEffects>7:00 PM</textEffects>, at which point, the campus is a desolate place. Now, you will recall the tape recorder. We know the time of the voice recording. It was <textEffects>7:10 PM</textEffects>, the day before the mock trial. That was the dark hour of this heinous crime.
</line><line>Athena:
D-Do you have any proof of that?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
As its final bell, this school plays a special broadcast when the clock strikes seven. The female voice on the tape appears ten minutes after that broadcast. The killer waited until the school was empty to spring her devious and deadly trap.
</line><line><textEffects>Tape Recorder updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So, when the witness saw the defendant, that would've been...!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Indeed. It was <textEffects>five minutes after</textEffects> the voice was captured on tape in the art room. Ergo, we know that the accused was still in the main building, even after the killing.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So the time of the murder and the time of when the body was moved...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Great... Another inconvenient testimony.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Cykes, your cross-examination, please.

<line>Athena:
Wow, is that the confidence and composure that comes from being a genius?
</line><line>Apollo:
Athena, it doesn't matter who's on the stand. Our job is still the same.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Sure, but if Junie was really still at school after 6:00 PM... Ugh. I didn't spot any inconsistencies in Hugh's testimony, either. What am I supposed to do now?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
So, you didn't talk to anybody on October 23rd? Are you sure about that?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. I already told you, my word is as good as gold.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, then how do you explain this? And don't spare any details.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Sorry, never seen that before.
</line><line>Athena:
This is the victim's planner. She recorded all of her plans in great detail. Take a look at this page here. It reads, "23rd - Meet with Hugh" and "Important." Don't you find that... interesting?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Wha-?! Where'd you get that?!
</line><line>Athena:
The keyword here is "<textEffects>important</textEffects>." You say you were at the archery range all day. But you also said a few students came and went while you were there. That doesn't sound like a great place for an important talk.
</line><line>Judge:
But the entire campus was buzzing with activity before the mock trial. Where could they have possibly had a private conversation?
</line><line>Athena:
I thought about that, too. But the situation changes after the last bell.
</line><line>Judge:
What's this, now?!
</line><line>Athena:
The witness stayed after the last bell... ...in order to have a private talk with the victim. Am I right, Mr. O'Conner?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
This is insane!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Must we go through this yet again? I suppose you also have no evidence, as usual.
</line><line>Athena:
No, I don't have any direct evidence. However, the witness was meditating until after the last bell. And he attempted to conceal his private meeting with the victim!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. First Robin, now me? Who are you going to accuse next? You're just another unscrupulous attorney looking to get ahead.
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't let him get to you. He's definitely hiding something. I mean, he was supposed to meet with the victim around her estimated time of death.
</line><line>Athena:
I had my suspicions about Robin, but... ...Hugh seems just as guilty! These three are the only possible suspects, after all!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner, answer me this! Did you meet with Prof. Courte that day?
</line><line>O'Conner:
..................... Sorry, Mr. Jailbird Prosecutor. I don't mean to steal your thunder, but I've something to say.
</line><line>Blackquill:
If it will save me some trouble, then by all means, speak away.
</line><line>O'Conner:
If you would recall, Ms. Cykes, the voice on the tape recorder was <textEffects>female</textEffects>. Knowing that, I'd like you to explain how I could possibly be a suspect.
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh... <textEffects>(He has a point...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph, impressive. Golden Boy here does shine gold, indeed. Care to take the reins? You're more than capable of prosecuting this case.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. Sorry, but I'm studying to be a lawyer.
</line><line>Blackquill:
What a pity. To think such <textEffects>genius</textEffects> is to be wasted on mere lawyering. At last, your moment is here, Cykes-dono. Time to refute Golden Boy's statement... ...and prove that you're the young prodigy worthy of the badge on your lapel!
</line><line>Athena:
Uuuurgh! <textEffects>(Could he lay any more pressure on...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
The voice is unmistakably female, so there's no point in arguing about that.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah... You're right. In which case...! <textEffects>(To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
The voice on the tape belongs to the victim. That's the only thing that makes sense.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Are you mad? The voice on the recording says, "<textEffects>You're a goner!</textEffects>" That is something a murderer shouts at their victim, not the other way around.
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... <textEffects>(Yeah, that is a problem.)</textEffects> You're a goner... You're a goner... You're a goner...
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
You're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Hue o conner? ...Wait a second!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whoa, Athena, you're scaring me here.
</line><line>Athena:
YOU'RE scared? I'm terrified for even coming up with this!
</line><line>Apollo:
With what?
</line><line>Athena:
Prosecutor Blackquill! You wanted to know if I am worthy of my badge. Well, I'm about to show you why, despite my age, I'm able to proudly wear this at all!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Oh? Then can I take it you won't be changing your argument? Still, it stands that it's a bit odd for the victim to be the one yelling, "You're a goner!"
</line><line>Athena:
I agree, if that's what the victim was saying. But it's not.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I assume you have something to back up your assertion, Ms. Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Not exactly... But you don't have to add fuel to his fire, Your Honor!)</textEffects> <textEffects>If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
I would like to call one basic fact into question. Is that shout on the tape really saying, "You're a goner!"?
</line><line>Apollo:
...What are you up to now, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Prof. Courte's planner says she was supposed to meet with the witness for an important talk. Perhaps our witness, despite being a genius, had done something wrong... And this made Prof. Courte <textEffects>get angry</textEffects> with him during their private meeting.
</line><line>Judge:
I don't see how this changes what we heard on the tape.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, if you want to see how it changes things ...then let's try a little experiment. Your Honor, I want you to tell at the witness as if you're mad at him. But... and this important... use his <textEffects>full name</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Okay! Let's see, um... Hugh O'Conner!!!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. What did I do to deserve that?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, like that! Now try again, but faster!
</line><line>Judge:
Hugh Aconner!!! ...Hm? Hue... a coner? Hew... o coner? You... a coner? W-Wait a second! ...No, no, no, this can't be.
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(You think I'd spend the energy to lead you this far if it wasn't true?!)</textEffects> Ah, but it is, Your Honor. Humans are not perfect, that's scientific fact. We sometimes mistake shadows for monsters, or the winds for voices.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Now that you mention it...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(You can do this, Athena! Just give the old guy one more little push...!)</textEffects> The voice on the tape recorder never was "You're a goner!" That's only what we thought we heard, when in fact, it was the witness getting yelled at! The court will note that this is different from the <textEffects>selective hearing</textEffects> men are so good at!
</line><line>Apollo:
...I think you're right, but what was that last part again?
</line><line>Athena:
Never mind. The important thing is that the voice that was recorded isn't our client's. And since it was the victim scolding the witness, he must now join the list of suspects!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Hrrrgh!
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. I had thought that testimony would suffice, but it seems it has come to this. I will not allow such fallacious quibbles to upend this case. The prosecution has one final piece of evidence to present to the court.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(E-Evidence? What's he going to pull out now?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Feast your eyes on this photo, and let me see that insolent look vanish from within them.
</line><line>Judge:
Let's see here... Oh, it's a picture of the defendant and the victim.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The photograph shows professor and student preparing for the mock trial together.
</line><line>Athena:
Wait, was this taken in the art room -- the room where the murder occurred?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Indeed it was. But the revelations do not end there. Do you see the clock on the wall? It reads 7:05, a mere <textEffects>five minutes before</textEffects> the voice was recorded on the tape.
</line><line>Athena:
WH-WHAAAAAAT!
</line><line>Blackquill:
The accused brutally stabbed the victim to death five minutes after this photo was taken.
</line><line><textEffects>School Camera Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems the defendant's culpability in this crime is quite obvious.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Junie was with Prof. Courte just five minutes before she was murdered? What now? Nothing I say can change that fact...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Understand now? You can believe in your client all wish, but try as you might... ...such misplaced faith will inevitably be cut down before the cruel, steely blade of truth.
</line><line>Athena:
Ngaaah!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Listen, missy. <textEffects>The person you'd like to save</textEffects> more than anyone else in the world? I'd be willing to wager that your defense isn't what they desire.
</line><line>Athena:
B-B-But...! I became a lawyer so I could--
</line><line>Blackquill:
You still fail to understand? After so much pain and defeat? The courts are not the play yards of little children dressed as lawyers. So before you break your back in failure... ...run along home and grow up!
</line><line>Athena:
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(If he thinks I'm giving up now, he's got another thing coming! I have to find my inner strength if I ever hope to save <span style="color:#E16935">him</textEffects>. But I can't think of any way to strike back. The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles? That's impossible! How could I smile under these circumstances, even if I forced it?!)</span>
</line><line>Apollo:
This is badder than bad! Who knew Blackquill had that one waiting in the wings! Why didn't that Twisted Samurai just present it at the beginning?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Wait, maybe this was his real plan? Was he just trying to show me how weak and powerless I am?! Maybe he's right, because I really haven't got a clue! Who's the real killer? Who murdered Prof. Constance Courte?)</textEffects> Robin Newman, a girl who had been forced to live a lie as a guy? Or was it Hugh O'Conner, the honor student who had met with Prof. Courte?
</line><line>Judge:
There seems to be little reason to debate the defendant's guilt any longer. The time for a verdict has come.

Ms. Newman, please explain yourself!

Juniper's not the killer. I know because... because I know who the real killer is.

<textEffects>(I don't get it. Why is SHE confessing?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Ms. Newman WAS witnessed near the stage. There's even a related photo of her. The more I think about it, the more suspicious she seems...

Wow, he really is a genius. He even knows what you're thinking.

Heh. I think it's about time I told you the truth. And I'll even get right to the point. It was me. I did it.

Now both potential suspects are claiming to be the real killer.
