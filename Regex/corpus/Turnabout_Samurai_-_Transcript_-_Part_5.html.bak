<line>Phoenix:
That was a close one, huh, Mia?
</line><line>Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
? M-Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
So, what happened?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.
</line><line>Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.
</line><line>Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!

Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... thank you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?
</line><line>Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!
</line><line>Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.
</line><line>Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.

Nick? I think her guard's down...

Y-yeah?

I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.

Whew! She's alive!

Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right.
</line><line>Maya:
But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?

This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later.
</line><line>Maya:
I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh huh.
</line><line>Maya:
I wonder if there're any other clues lying around.

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'!

Oh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you.

Heh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me...

<textEffects>("Dramatique" indeed...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ahem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal. Traces thereof.

And this is...?

A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.
</line><line>Penny:
... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.

What, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me?

E-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer!
</line><line>Maya:
She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance?

<line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume.

This is the picture.

Is... this <textEffects>the trailer</textEffects> in Studio Two?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Hammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but how did you get this?
</line><line>Oldbag:
It... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it.

Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!

... The wind.

The... huh?

It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer.

</line><line>Vasquez:
Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?)</textEffects> Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!
</line><line>Vasquez:
Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?
</line><line>Maya:
Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!
</line><line>Vasquez:
Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.
</line><line>Maya:
B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!
</line><line>Vasquez:
Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying "accident," "accident"... How are you so sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Vasquez:
Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... <textEffects>on purpose</textEffects>?
</line><line>Vasquez:
That is what I mean.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?
</line><line>Vasquez:
Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!
</line><line>Maya:
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!
</line><line>Vasquez:
Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(... So that's why she had the photo...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Vasquez:
She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.
</line><line>Maya:
W-what? This is valuable evidence!

<center>Boys!</center>
<line>Phoenix:
... U-umm... Who are they...?
</line><line>Vasquez:
Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Vasquez:
The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is <textEffects>Mr. Hammer's "dirt"</textEffects>... no? Why should <textEffects>Dee Vasquez</textEffects> care about it at all?
</line><line>Vasquez:
... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.
</line><line>Maya:
Nooooooooooooo!

Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!

H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.

Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...

Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ...

Detective Gumshoe?

Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!

Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.
