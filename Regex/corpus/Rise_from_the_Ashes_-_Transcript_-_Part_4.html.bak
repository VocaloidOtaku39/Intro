</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Meekins. You work in the General Affairs Department, do you not?
</line><line>Meekins:
Yes, sir! I am in charge of hiring new recruits, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yikes! Now there's a scary thought.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Evidence transferal was taking place on the day of the crime, which meant many officers were given special tasks not ordinarily performed.
</line><line>Meekins:
I was in charge of guarding the Blue Badger, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
The Blue Badger?
</line><line>Meekins:
Yes, sir. The lovely police mascot created by the Head Detective, sir! I was to ensure it wasn't broken during the transferal process. That was my sole mission for the day, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Sounds like a very... uh, important mission.
</line><line>Meekins:
After the awards ceremony finished that day, there were so many people running around that I relocated the Blue Badger to the evidence room!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... So that's why you went to the evidence room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell us... what did you see when you got there?
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir! I was suddenly attacked!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
This is what he was telling us yesterday.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we need to try and skim some more detail from him. For starters, what was an officer from the General Affairs Department doing in there in the first place?
</line><line>Ema:
Right! Let's press him for all he's worth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>(<i>Pressing all statements leads to:</i>)
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we now have a fairly accurate picture of what happened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Only one thing remains unclear. Was the man this officer "murdered," really the victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's got a point...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Meekins:
Um...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Officer Meekins?
</line><line>Meekins:
With regard to that, sir... Take a look at this. It was sent to my cell. Chief Gant delivered it to me just this morning sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Chief?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Delivered it...?
</line><line>Judge:
What is that? A... videotape?
</line><line>Meekins:
Yes, sir! That's absolutely right, sir! A videotape, sir! It contains footage from the <textEffects>security camera</textEffects> in the evidence room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!? But I specifically asked if there was such a tape, and was told it had been mistakenly erased!
</line><line>Judge:
That's quite a mistake.
</line><line>Meekins:
I just do what I'm told, sir. It's the only thing I'm really good at.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, let's have a look! Show us the video of you murdering the victim!
</line><line>Meekins:
Oh... Please stop using that word, "murder," sir! It scares me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?)</textEffects> ...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Meekins:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I believe we're all thinking the same thing. How can we deal with these unsettling feelings stirred within us...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?
</line><line>Meekins:
Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why am I not surprised this isn't going smoothly?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Security Video added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well anyway... this tape seems to prove that that the witness did indeed encounter... er, "someone" in the evidence room, and some sort of... er, "activity" did take place...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor... instead of relying on clearly incomplete footage, the witness's testimony will suffice. Is that alright with you, Officer Meekins?
</line><line>Meekins:
Yes, sir! As you wish, sir!

<line>Meekins:
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!
I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!
The locker he opened is unquestionably Detective Goodman's locker, sir!
So it must be him! No one else could have unlocked it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
What's this about a fingerprint?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Each detective has been given a locker, equipped with a fingerprint-activated lock. These locks ensure that each locker can only be opened by the detective it belongs to.
</line><line>Judge:
Intriguing... That would mean... the victim at the crime scene would have to have been Detective Goodman. Very well! The defense may begin its cross-examination!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't know where this cross-examination will lead, but everything begins with <span style="color:#E16935">contradictions</textEffects>. That's where I have to start!)</span>

<line>Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
</line><line>Judge:
Strange?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
</line><line>Judge:
What? This video contains such a contradiction?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "<textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>" in the video.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He would want me to point it out...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to point out a problem in <span style="color:#E16935">the video</textEffects>? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)</span>
</line><line>Ema:
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
</line><line>Meekins:
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This all sounds true enough, but the victim's body was found at the Prosecutor's Office. There has to be a mistake somewhere...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
The real thing's so much more intense than in the movies! Here, you can use the player to watch it as much as you'd like.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The security video... <textEffects>(Maybe I should take another look at the footage...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this! Officer Meekins.
</line><line>Meekins:
Sir! D-do you mean me, sir?
</line><line>Phoenix:
As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint. If the print matches the registered data, the light turns on and the lock is released.
</line><line>Meekins:
A-according to my very limited experience, that's the way I understand it, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?
</line><line>Judge:
What's this!? It's... already lit!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!
</line><line>Meekins:
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! What's the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But the locker locks are controlled by an electronic system. When a door is shut, a sensor is triggered... and the locker is automatically locked!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, I know! It must have broken down! Of course, I'm not an expert in this...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's not likely, Your Honor. The sensor would detect and report any malfunction.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh well. It just goes to show novices should keep their mouths shut. So then, Mr. Wright. Do you have an explanation?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. Why wasn't the locker locked?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor? ... Yes, well. You see... This isn't exactly my field... What do you think, Miss "Scientific Investigator"?
</line><line>Ema:
Huh? Oh, um... Maybe something, like, jammed the electronic system?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Something... jammed the sensor? Say... There's something else that seems out of place in this video.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah, I thought so too! There's got to be another clue somewhere in this footage!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's inspect the video once more. The locker wasn't locked... Mr. Wright. Please point out <textEffects>the cause</textEffects> for this!
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier.
</line><line>Judge:
What's this? Something white fell out of the locker!
</line><line>Meekins:But sir! It's been my experience that things fall out when doors are opened! I often fall out and roll great distances when I open my car door, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
We can't be sure that item was in the locker to begin with.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The sensor triggers the lock when the door is shut... What if something was inserted, say, between the sensor and the door?
</line><line>Judge:
In... Inserted...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This white thing wasn't inside the locker... It was stuck between the door and the sensor!
</line><line>Meekins:
Oh, I understand now, sir! It's just like my tie! Two out of three times it gets stuck in the door when I get out of my patrol vehicle, sir! Instead of the door closing, My tie chokes me!
</line><line>Judge:
But the object would have to be extremely thin to fit in the door.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not only that, it would also have to block electrical currents... It would need to be an <textEffects>insulator</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, an insulator! But at the crime scene...
</line><line>Phoenix:
there just might have been something that fits the description.
</line><line>Meekins:
But s-sir! By "insulator," you don't mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I think I've finally got this figured out.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence! What was this insulator that was stuck in the door?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove.
</line><line>Judge:
But we can't be sure that was in the victim's locker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It has a tag that says, "SL-9 Incident."
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The video seems to depict the victim opening the locker, but that isn't the case! The lit lamp attests to this. On the day of the crime, even I could have opened that locker! Is this not so, Officer Meekins!?
</line><line>Meekins:
Sir... It would appear so, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So are we to believe then, that the "victim" whom this witness stabbed in the evidence room... was <textEffects>not Detective Goodman</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do not be misled, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defense has merely demonstrated that possibility, and nothing more. The "victim" in the video was indeed Bruce Goodman. The prosecution will offer one more testimony to prove this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins, please testify about this.
</line><line>Meekins:
Sir! M-me, sir!? I'm not sure what you're referring too, sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Meekins:
O-oh! You mean that, sir! Of course, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is this a joke...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, begin your testimony!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Mystery Man (2) --</textEffects></center>
<line>Meekins:
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
An ID card record. I see...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have the ID card record right here, Your Honor. The ID used at 5:14... is that of the victim.
</line><line>Judge:
Just before the crime, hmm? Yes, without a doubt this is the victim's ID! However, one thing does strike me as unusual... Several hundred cases should have been due for transferal. Why were there so few people using this room?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This particular evidence room is only used for storing certain special cases.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Special" cases...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Extremely violent cases involving police staff.
</line><line>Ema:
Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There were only a few cases up for transferal there, and most were cleared up by noon.
</line><line>Judge:
Right... I see. Now, Let us move on to the cross-examination.
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Meekins:

</line>


<line>Meekins:
<textEffects>At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! What do you think?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm... confused.
</line><line>Ema:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The problem with this ID card testimony is far too obvious. It's not like Edgeworth to miss something like this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
You're thinking too hard about it. Come on, let's show them what we've got!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Wait one moment, Officer Meekins.
</line><line>Meekins:
I-I'm not good at waiting, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at <textEffects>the crime scene</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
That makes sense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
When I say, "crime scene," I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the "other" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
</line><line>Judge:
A... Lost Item Report? It's only half completed,
</line><line>Phoenix:
but it shows that Detective Goodman had lost "something" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let me guess. You believe this "something" to be his ID card, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! So now... what does this all mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Does the prosecution have a response?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I have only one thing to say to the defense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Bravo, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-bravo...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to summarize the defense's argument. At 5:15 PM on the day of the crime, the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman. There are two grounds to support this. First, the locker in the evidence room was already <textEffects>unlocked</textEffects>. Second, the victim <textEffects>lost his ID card</textEffects>. Am I correct so far, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... <textEffects>(What's he up to?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That being the case, we must inevitably arrive at a single conclusion: If the "victim" in this video is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>... then the murder in the evidence room is also <textEffects>fake</textEffects>! In other words, the security camera does not show the instant of the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright? Only moments ago you seemed content to be pointing your finger around.
</line><line>Phoenix:
This isn't good...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, well... It seems you've finally realized... exactly what you've gone to such lengths to prove!
</line><line>Judge:
Explain yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defense has already done the explaining for me. The victim in this video is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>... which means a murder did not take place at the Police Department at 5:15 on the day of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
So...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So the real crime could only take place at one location: the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office! The murderer being Ms. Lana Skye, the defendant! The evidence is compelling! A trustworthy witness... observed the moment the defendant used the murder weapon!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaah! <textEffects>(I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The activity in the evidence room still leaves many questions unanswered: Who exactly was the "victim" Officer Meekins encountered? And where did this person disappear to...? However... This trial's purpose is to examine only the murder of Detective Goodman.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just so, Your Honor.
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What do I do? How am I supposed to get myself out of this mess?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
One moment, Your Honor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What now, Mr. Wright? Don't tell me you're objecting to what you've just proven.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course not. But I almost walked right into the prosecution's trap!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This cross-examination has proven one thing and one thing only. The security video did not show the actual murder. However! It cannot be said that it is unrelated to the murder in the parking lot. Specifically, large amounts of blood traces were found in the evidence room!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense demands further examination into the truth of the matter!
</line><line>Judge:
...Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
If this court were to examine this further, other witnesses will be necessary. Is the prosecution prepared?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, Your Honor... The prosecution considered the incident at the Police Department to be unrelated. We have not prepared any other witnesses for this incident.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This just might be my chance. Time to call a certain Texas ranger to the stand!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright... Do you mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. The defense would like to request a specific witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh? Whom do you have in mind?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Someone we have reason to believe knows the truth... The truth behind the activities that took place in the evidence room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution requests to hear this person's name before deciding whether or not to comply.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, then. Mr. Wright! This person whom you would have testify... What is his or her name?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Officer... Jake Marshall.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why him?
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution agrees to the defense's request. Since he was responsible for guarding the room, we should hear his testimony. Fortunately he works in the Police Department. We shouldn't need longer than 20 minutes to prepare.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court will take a 30 minute recess while the witness is subpoenaed. Will the prosecution please prepare the witness during this time?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We will, Your Honor.

Oh... Oh ho! Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho ho! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! You mean this, right!?

My apologies, Detective. Due to my present circumstances, I was forced to use Mr. Wright's name when making my request.
</line><line>Phoenix:
My name!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Never in a million years would I have thought it was you who asked me, "Could I bother you to bring me the SL-9 Incident files?" "I'll need them by noon." Talk about crazy...

Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway.

I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail.

</line><line>Marshall:
I mean the security cameras and the ID card reader. I reckon even a cowpoke like you knows about those.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, well, what about <textEffects>the fingerprint activated locks</textEffects> inside the evidence room?
</line><line>Marshall:

It's quite simple. You left a very large trail behind at the scene. Or, to be exact... a handprint.
</line><line>Marshall:
Hmph! Listen real good, pardner. Like I said, I'm the caretaker of that crypt. I pay my respects... that is, make my rounds, about once a month. It's only natural my fingerprints would be in there.

Witness! What's the meaning of this!? Your bloodstained fingerprints were at the crime scene...!?

The blood was wiped away. However! A luminol test clearly revealed this! Well, Officer Marshall?

<line>Phoenix:
Bringing our attention back to the security camera... is a mistake I'm afraid you'll soon not forget, Officer Marshall.
</line><line>Marshall:
... The days are short in Texas... and so are our tempers. Could you sum up what you have to say in eight words or less?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Very well. <textEffects>You can clearly be seen in this video!</textEffects>
</line><line>Marshall:
Exactly eight words... Not bad, pardner.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The key... lies in a certain locker shown in the video.
</line><line>Judge:
See this locker that has a <textEffects>white cloth</textEffects> sticking out? This is the witness's locker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now then, let's rewind the video a bit.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! The white cloth... it's gone! What's the meaning of this, Officer Marshall!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When the crime took place... The white cloth wasn't there. Then... it suddenly appeared! There's only one explanation: Officer Marshall! You were in the evidence room at the time of the crime! What's more, you opened your locker when the camera was turned away!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! It would seem that's the only-
</line><line>Marshall:
Hold your horses! Sorry, pardner... but you got the wrong man.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Marshall:
So what if my locker was opened? That doesn't mean I'm the one who opened it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Marshall:
The murderer needed to hide something, so he opened a locker and stuck it in. It's not my fault he happened to choose mine!
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Marshall:
... Why's everyone staring at me like I'm a wanted man?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This guy isn't just playing dumb... He really doesn't know!)</textEffects> Uh, I hate to rain on your parade, but you're the only person who can open that particular locker.
</line><line>Marshall:
Oh yeah? I call your bluff. You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!
</line>


<line>Marshall:
A... "fingerprint" sensor?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We talked about this earlier today. The lockers can only be opened by the detectives they belong to.
</line><line>Marshall:
W-what kinda crazy talk is this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Well, Detective Gumshoe did mention something about this...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So, sheriff! What do you have to say... in eight words or less?
</line><line>Marshall:
I only got one word for you, pardner. <textEffects>NOOOOOO!!!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Witness! Explain yourself!
</line><line>Marshall:
If this is a joke, it's the worst I've ever heard...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?
</line><line>Marshall:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Olé! Please answer the question!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is he now, a bullfighter?)</textEffects> That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here.
</line><line>Judge:
We can?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall.
</line><line>Judge:
If that's so, then... where was the witness?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has an answer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well then? Let's hear it. <textEffects>Where was Officer Marshall at the time of the crime?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
</line><line>Judge:
There? But that's... That's where the victim, Detective Goodman, was!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Correct... unless the man wasn't Detective Goodman. I believe the "victim" in the video is... Officer Marshall! It was you, dressed up like Detective Goodman!

But that's preposterous! Officer Meekins witnessed the detective at the crime scene! Once he saw the man's face, he'd know for sure!

</line><line>Phoenix:
May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Meekins:
When I entered the evidence room, I asked him to show his card, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
</line><line>Meekins:
He suddenly pulled a knife on me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Something about the Officer's story puzzled me. If the man had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, he would have needed it to enter the evidence room, so he must have been carrying it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see, <textEffects>Detective Goodman's picture</textEffects> is on his ID card.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, I get it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?
</line><line>Marshall:
... You've got quite an imagination, pardner. We got a term for that. It's called "circumstantial evidence."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Circumstantial evidence...? <textEffects>(He's still denying it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Marshall:
You're gonna have to do better than that to break a detective. Unless you have hard evidence proving I dressed up as the victim...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I can't say I particularly care for your uncooperative disposition...
</line><line>Marshall:
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any evidence? Any evidence proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Officer Marshall dressed up as the victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... <textEffects>(Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Marshall:
I can see the fear in your eyes, pardner. Seems you're the one who couldn't take the desert heat!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! <textEffects>(This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Hmph. It looks like your lack of experience has finally been exposed.
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll pass onto you what someone told me when I was just starting out. When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The basics... <textEffects>(For me, that would be what Mia used to tell me!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nick! Try thinking outside of the box!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I shouldn't look for proof <span style="color:#E16935">that Officer Marshall was in disguise</textEffects>... but rather I should look for evidence that came about <textEffects>because he was in disguise</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why do you think this locker was opened in the first place?
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no reason for Officer Marshall to open his locker at the time of the crime. Yet he did, despite the chance that it might be discovered later as it has been.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime. Then, after the crime was "committed," he opened his own locker for some unknown reason.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The fact that a white "<textEffects>cloth</textEffects>" is sticking out of the locker seems to indicate that he opened it in order to put the cloth inside.
</line><line>Judge:
So... just what exactly is this <textEffects>piece of cloth</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. <textEffects>(I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Marshall:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's take yet another look at the security tape. After commiting the crime, the witness opened the locker to put away <textEffects>the white cloth</textEffects>. Please show us why the witness had to open his locker!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman, and entered the evidence room. I don't know what that reason was... yet.
</line><line>Marshall:
"Yet"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, something unexpected happened. Officer Meekins barged in on you. When asked to show your ID card, you pulled a knife on him. However! Officer Meekins panicked, and the white coat you were wearing was <textEffects>soiled with blood</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
A bloody white coat...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You couldn't just walk out like that, so you hid the coat in your locker.
</line><line>Marshall:
... Not bad, huh "pardner"?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now then, Officer Marshall. Are you ready to tell us the truth?
</line><line>Marshall:
Looks like I underestimated y'all. I hope you're happy now, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Marshall:
Two years ago... if you were only half as persistent then as you are today, we all wouldn't have to be here, now would we?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Officer Marshall! Tell the court what you did... all of it.

I wasn't expecting Officer Meekins. I knocked him out...
and managed to escape. I knew which areas wouldn't be caught on the camera.
There wasn't any murder in the evidence room at 5:15.

So the supposed "victim" was really you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But there's one thing I still don't understand. Large quantities of blood traces were found on the floor of the evidence room. If no one was murdered, then how could that be?
</line><line>Marshall:
Officer Meekins managed to cut his own hand. My guess is he's the donor.

</line><line>Phoenix:
in a list of murder victims. "Neil Marshall"... Are you related to this man?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Neil Marshall...?
</line><line>Marshall:
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard the name. Two years ago... he received the same lousy prosecutor award you got.
</line><line>Judge:
What!? A prosecutor...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now I remember... Prosecutor Neil Marshall. He handled the SL-9 case before I did.
</line><line>Marshall:
That's right. He was killed... and the case fell into your hands.
</line><line>Judge:
But what's his relation to you...?
</line><line>Marshall:
He was my brother. He was investigating the murders with Damon Gant, Chief Detective at the time. The group of detectives I was part of worked under them. We were desperate to prosecute the killer. Joe Darke... My brother fought Darke and was killed. That was the first time Darke left behind any evidence. That was all we needed. He was arraigned and incarcerated. The case was finally closed... at least, according to the public records.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Marshall:
My brother couldn't have been killed by Joe Darke. I knew my brother better than anyone... No one could have beaten him in a fight.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's it? That's your reason for your insane actions?
</line><line>Marshall:
There's more to my brother's death than what the records say. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can't fool me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Well... at least one thing's for certain. Now we know what happened at the Police Department on the day of the crime.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That was the last day the SL-9 case could be reopened. Not satisfied with its resolution, Officer Marshall planned to steal the evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, this mystery has finally been cleared up. No murder took place at the Police Department that day!
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The things that happen by chance never cease to amaze... At exactly the same time as the murder at the Prosecutor's Office... this fake murder was going on at the Police Department.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So if no one was murdered at the Police Department on the day of the crime, that means the murder in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot was the real one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which, in turn, means... only one person could have committed the crime: Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but wait! A verdict wasn't reached in yesterday's trial!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which is why we examined the incident at the Police Department today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's only one reason the defendant was not convicted yesterday: there yet remained the mystery of the simultaneous murder at the Police Department.
</line><line>Marshall:
It seems to me... this boy's got the draw on you, pardner.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All the mysteries at the Police Department have been uncovered. No contradictions remain. The murder took place at the Prosecutor's Office! The only suspect is Lana Skye. There were no errors in the testimony of the witness, Angel Starr! If you have a response... make it one word or less.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... ARRRGHHHH!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I rest my case.
</line><line>Judge:
It seems this trial has reached its conclusion. There's no room for doubt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well done, Mr. Wright. Thanks to you, I didn't need to waste my time... disproving the alleged "murder" at the Police Department.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's no doubt what I proved today is true... The apparent murder on the security camera's tape really was fake! But I didn't realize... that would end up proving Lana guilty!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ema:
Y-your Honor! Wait!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema!
</line><line>Ema:
The defense has an objection. A scientific objection! Right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean, "right?"
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Are you this girl's guardian?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Oh, uh... in a sense...
</line><line>Ema:
Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I don't want to leave any loose ends. You want a minute? I'll give you three.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mean the traces of blood found on Detective Gumshoe's locker...
</line><line>Judge:
But no fingerprints were found on it, right?
</line><line>Ema:
No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!
</line><line>Phoenix:! So did you find something?
</line><line>Ema:
Um... No!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Ema:
Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Ema:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... Is that all?
</line><line>Ema:
Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And I'm just an attorney...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me? Oh boy...
</line><line>Judge:
Time's up. Now then, Mr. Wright. With regard to the incident at the Police Department... Does any reasonable doubt remain?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears the defense is troubled by the other blood mark. Looking at the floor plans, a handprint was discovered around here. Is there a problem with this?
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be...
</line><line>Judge:
Please answer my question, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This handprint left at the crime scene... clearly shows a contradiction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The only thing that seems clear is you're grasping, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Judge:
You've been staring pretty intently at those floor plans. Tell me... is there a problem with them?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Yes, this is strange...!)</textEffects> Take a good look at these floor plans. Something is missing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"Missing"...? You mean, something hasn't been drawn on there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Something that, when drawn, will completely change the meaning of the blood mark!
</line><line>Judge:
Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time. Very well, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(With all this evidence here... there's got to be something I can use!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The question is... which item can prove something is missing in the floor plans?
</line>


<line>Marshall:
What about that piece of plywood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Explain yourself, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
</line><line>Marshall:
So?
</line><line>Phoenix:
So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
</line><line>Judge:
Well... what?
</line><line>Edgeworth:! *gasp!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
</line><line>Marshall:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
So that means... Uh... just exactly what does that mean!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means it can't be done!
</line><line>Judge:
What are you saying? Blood traces were undeniably found on that locker!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't look at me, I didn't put it there!
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema!
</line><line>Ema:
On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
</line><line>Judge:
Just one moment! I will not allow such farfetched balderdash in my courtroom!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-but how...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the "other" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's ridiculous! I refute you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The murder portrayed in the security tape has been proven to be a fake. However! That does not explain the blood mark found on the locker!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So then... assuming this "murder" you purport really happened. When did it take place!? I demand you show evidence that proves it occurred!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(When did the first incident occur...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
To surmise, the defense claims that... prior to Officer Meekins being cut by Jake Marshall, who was disguised as Detective Goodman, another "incident" took place in that evidence room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The blood mark on the locker proves this.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Then tell us... When did this "first" incident occur? Proof must be presented.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Proof that shows when the murder took place... There's only one piece of evidence that can show that!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then. Will the defense please present its evidence? What shows when the "first" crime took place?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have entered the room. In order to do so, an ID card is required.
</line><line>Judge:
An ID card... Oh! The ID Card Record!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
</line><line>Judge:
Let's see here... 4:50 PM. If the crime took place before that time, then it would be... 4:40 PM... Ah! AAAAAAAHHH! M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Miles Edgeworth! Just what have you done!?
</line><line>Marshall:
I never figured you had nerve, boy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Put off the act, witness. It doesn't take a lot of thought to figure out it couldn't have been me.
</line><line>Marshall:
Hmm... Nope, I ain't gettin' it...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't understand either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's clear from the luminol test that blood was there. However, when the "second" crime took place... both Officer Meekins and Officer Marshall failed to notice the blood.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would have had just ten minutes to murder the victim, carry his body away, and clean up the blood... Unfortunately that's physically impossible.
</line><line>Judge:
That would mean... the crime must have taken place before Mr. Edgeworth entered the evidence room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: "7777777"!
</line><line>Marshall:
Talk about a lucky number...
</line><line>Judge:
But wait... That doesn't make sense! How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with "7777777"!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please look into this ASAP! Find out whose ID number is "sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's one "seven" too many, Your Honor. Unfortunately... I'm unable to look up the owner of that ID card. At least, at present.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Marshall:
Explain yourself, son.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The ID number "7777777" belongs to someone with a rank of Captain or higher... Someone who is a so-called "executive officer." We don't have the authority to inquire into such a person's identity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But that's ridiculous! Just how...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not finished talking, Mr. Wright. There is one situation in which we can be granted such authority.
</line><line>Judge:
If an official charge filed against an executive is accepted.
</line><line>Phoenix:
An "official charge"...
</line><line>Marshall:
You're all alike, aren't you? With your "cover-ups" and your "forgeries"... That's how the Prosecutor's Office operates!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I take pride in my work, Officer Marshall. I would appreciate it if you would keep your slander to yourself.
</line><line>Marshall:
"Slander," is it? Okay. Let me ask a question.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes?
</line><line>Marshall:
No, not to you. To her, the defendant sitting over there. Your own little "executive."
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(L-Lana?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't be stupid. She's been charged with murder. Of course we've looked up her ID number... and it's not "7777777."
</line><line>Marshall:
Don't play me for a fool, pardner. That's not what I want to ask. All I want to know is one thing... about that incident.
</line><line>Judge:
The SL-9 Incident?
</line><line>Marshall:
Answer me this, Chief Prosecutor! In that trial two years ago... Did you really only use legitimate evidence!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Do you need the witness to repeat his question, Chief Prosecutor?
</line><line>Lana:
I heard him fine, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Two years ago... I was in charge of the prosecution for that trial. At the time, we...
</line><line>Lana:
Occasionally... we felt the powerlessness of the law. At least... I did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Ema:
L-Lana...
</line><line>Lana:
I became a prosecutor in order to suppress crime with the law. But before I realized it, we were the ones being suppressed by the law.
</line><line>Judge:
Defendant! Just what are you saying!?
</line><line>Marshall:
I'll ask you again, Chief Prosecutor. During that trial two years ago... did you really present all the evidence in court? Can you look me, an investigator in that crime, in the eye and say that you did?
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Prosecutor! You didn't...
</line><line>Lana:
... I don't have to, Officer Marshall.
</line><line>Edgeworth:! Why don't you answer him!?
</line><line>Lana:
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
</line><line>Ema:
But Lana!
</line><line>Lana:
Even if it involved "forging" evidence.
</line><line>Marshall:
See? That's what I'm talking about.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDERRRRR!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lana's remarks caused such a stir... the chaos in the courtroom could not be quelled. The conclusion of the trial... would have to wait until the following day...
