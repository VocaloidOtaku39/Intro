Maya:
You know, I'm glad we found the urn and all, but poor Mr. DeLite got arrested again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, supposedly, Mr. DeLite was in the CEO's office when the murder occurred.
</line><line>Maya:
No way, Jose! I don't buy it!
</line><line>Pearl:
But the one who proved that Mr. DeLite was there... It was Mr. Nick himself... ...At least, from what I can understand.
</line><line>Maya:
Looks like you did too good of a job this time, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, ah... well, how about we get started looking into the KB Security murder?
</line><line>Pearl:
I think I'm going to head back to Kurain Village for a little while, if that's alright.
</line><line>Maya:
Sure. But why?
</line><line>Pearl:
I'm going to bring the Sacred Urn back and have some people take a look at it!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, that's a good idea! I think I'll go with--
</line><line>Pearl:
No! Mystic Maya! You should stay here! I want you to spend some special quality time together, full of love and happiness!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Maybe Pearls is so caught up in her fantasy she forgot there's a murder to solve.)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Sacred Urn given to Pearls.</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Now remember! No fighting, OK?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...She's gone.
</line><line>Maya:
OK, Nick! Time to get doing on this murder investigation!

Maya...
</line><line>Maya:
I'm sorry, it's just so sad... This was our big chance for everyone to learn about spirit channeling...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maybe I can cheer her up somehow...)</textEffects> Well, now that we've got the Sacred Urn back, maybe they can reopen it?
</line><line>Maya:
R-Really...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure! Maybe we can label it, "The Urn of Mask☆DeMasque's Desires"! That would probably attract a lot of attention!
</line><line>Maya:
...Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!! That's brilliant, Nick! We could clean up! And be filthy rich! Woohoo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow, that was surprisingly easy...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Andrews:
Um, so! How is it going!? What about the Sacred Urn...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The urn...? Oh, that. It's been taken care of already.
</line><line>Maya:
What do you mean, "Oh, that"!?
</line><line>Andrews:
"Taken care of"...? Do you mean... It's been found!?
</line><line>Maya:
Yes! It was brought in during the trial today!
</line><line>Andrews:
Wow! Really!? You really are the greatest, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Maya:
"Mr. Wright" had nothing to do with it. It was Mask☆DeMasque's wife that found it!
</line><line>Andrews:
Well, anyway, I'm... I'm so relieved!

Whoa, this place is literally crawling with cops!
</line><line>Maya:
What did you expect? Now that they know he was actually Mask☆DeMasque... This must be incredibly embarrassing for them, don't you think?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess they're trying to make up for it by tearing the place apart. Hey, I just noticed... Gumshoe is nowhere to be seen.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, he is a homicide detective. He's probably working on the murder case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But wasn't he in charge of the Mask☆DeMasque investigation all the way up to yesterday?
</line><line>Maya:
Well, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it? He'd say something like: "There's nothin' like a good murder case, pal."
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Points for the quality of the impression, but I'm not sure Gumshoe has bloodlust, Maya.)</textEffects>

Sounds like they're interrogating Mr. DeLite right now.
</line><line>Maya:
Man, and we don't have enough time as it is.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, well, I guess the police are going crazy just like we are. Yesterday they thought he was just a thief, but now they got a murder case on their hands.
</line><line>Maya:
I guess you're right... That guard over there looks a bit on edge, too.

Come on. We'll just have to come back later.

Don't say that, Nick! She don't need your help beating herself up.

Hey, Nicky boy! Please! Please help Ronnie! He's not a killer, I swear! My Ronnie wouldn't hurt a fly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Alright. I'll poke around and see what I can find out.
</line><line>Desirée:
Really! Are you serious!? Oh, I'm so happy! I knew asking for your help was the right thing to do. I... I don't know what I can do to help anymore...

Sure was, pal! That prosecutor made real fools out of us...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... I feel for you.

Wow, that's not like you at all... I thought you'd be more like... "Oh, that was great! You guys got what you deserved, pal! Ho ho ho ho!" Or something to that effect.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
D-Do I really sound like that to you, pal?
</line><line>Maya:
If the Gumshoe fits...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... Well, anyway... The point is I can tell when someone puts their heart into their jobs. And I can sympathize when things don't go your way. ...Sometimes, I feel like "wrong" is the only way things go for us detectives.

Wow, I had no idea Detective Gumshoe was such a nice guy.

Here I was working my fingers to the bone... And in walks an angel! I've got no problems with a daytime date. It's all good!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, that's not what we're here for. We're investigating the Bullard murder case.

...Huh? Oh yeah! That's right! You're a lawyer, aren't you?

<textEffects>(He's so hopelessly clueless.)</textEffects>

Hmm... Well, I don't mind sharing with my sweet little Maya. But Nick here is a different story!

<line>Phoenix:
This wallet... You know about this, right?
</line><line>Butz:
I've never seen it before.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Liar! You hand delivered this wallet to Ms. DeLite just yesterday!
</line><line>Butz:
Gimme a break! You can't just expect me to remember every little thing that happens!

Well, I do expect you to remember something that happened just yesterday!

What time was it when you found this last night?

I guess it was around <textEffects>1:00 in the morning</textEffects> on the first floor of our company building.

<hr />
<line>Butz:
<textEffects>1 o'clock</textEffects>... In the morning...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. In other words, Larry... At the time the of the murder, you were <textEffects>away from the security guard office</textEffects>!
</line><line>Butz:
AAAAAAAAH!!
</line>

<line>
Butz:
Y-Y-Yeah, B-B-But! th-there's something you didn't think about!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's that?
</line><line>Butz:
My shift that day didn't start until 10:00 PM! The murderer might have snuck in <textEffects>before then</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Butz:
If the murderer had snuck in before 10:00 PM... ...then it wasn't my fault! It was the fault of the guy whose shift was before mine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why do I have the feeling that he still doesn't get the seriousness of this...?)</textEffects> Listen up, Larry. We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that... <textEffects>the killer "snuck" into the CEO's office <span style="color:#E16935">after</textEffects> 10:00 PM, during your shift!</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Larry... When you use this key card, does it leave a record?
</line><line>Butz:
Yeah, it does. But I can't show the record to just anyone you know...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That key card data was already made public in the trial today.
</line><line>Butz:
What!? I didn't know that! Any kind of request for info like that is supposed to go through me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Boy does that sound a bit arrogant coming from a part time guard...)</textEffects> Anyway, according to the data, the door to the CEO's office was opened with this card... Furthermore, it was most definitely used at <textEffects>1 AM</textEffects>, the time of the murder!
</line><line>Butz:
No way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, someone used this to get into the CEO's office. That happened at <textEffects>1 AM on the night of the crime</textEffects>. Right in the middle of your shift!
</line><line>Butz:
Ooooh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Larry, you can't duck your responsibility this time!
</line><line>Butz:
GYYYYYAAAAAAR! NOOO!

On the same night the Sacred Urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor Department Store... ...a blackmail letter you got summoned you to KB Security to hand over some money.

Mr. Kane Bullard... Do you swear that it wasn't you who killed him?

Well there's no need to worry! They said it's the <textEffects>real urn</textEffects>!

But there's one small problem.

Um, these cute little pink splotches... They said that it's paint... And that they were put on the urn <textEffects>recently</textEffects>!

<line>Phoenix:
Sorry to break it to you, but the urn is the genuine article. Pearls went back to Kurain Village and had it examined.
</line><line>Andrews:
Is-Is that right? That's nice, but I don't see how...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What she discovered was that the vase was broken... again.
</line><line>Andrews:
D-Did you say... "again"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. It was broken once a year ago. And now it looks like the same thing has happened. And quite recently, too...
</line><line>Andrews:
R-Recently!? Are you saying that this urn was broken recently!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.
</line><line>Andrews:
<textEffects>Why do you think it was broken recently? How do you know?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This poster... It was made recently, right?
</line><line>Andrews:
Poster...? Ah! The poster for the exhibit!
</line><line>Phoenix:
At the time when this photo was taken, the urn said, "<textEffects>I AM</textEffects>" on it. But now, for some mysterious reason, it says, "<textEffects>AMI</textEffects>"! When the urn was fixed, the letters were transposed!

Ah! W-Wait!

The first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.
</line><line>Pearl:
But Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.
</line><line>Andrews:
Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that <textEffects>golden statue</textEffects> just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.
</line><line>Maya:
A-And?
</line><line>Andrews:
I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for <textEffects>covering up the paint stains</textEffects>. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.

What is it, Pearl?

The day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.

<textEffects>(She's right about that...)</textEffects> Well, Ms. Andrews?
</line><line>Andrews:
Huh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?

Well then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely <span style="color:#E16935">closer to the door</textEffects>! Then the next day, <textEffects>it was moved</textEffects>. But why...?)</span>

Wh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask☆DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.
