<line>Phoenix: 
...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>That's far enough!You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!</textEffects></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Wha...!? What have I done wrong!?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>I cannot allow you to go on like this!</textEffects></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Silence!You are no longer worthy of your title.</textEffects></captions>
<hr />
<line>...I've had this dream before; someplace, sometime ago... ...As if this day was written into my destiny... ...Today I'll stand in court as a lawyer... ...To prove a killer innocent.

</line><line>Phoenix:
Hello, this is Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Engarde:
<textEffects>You don't look so well, dude.</textEffects> You're gonna prove me not guilty today, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects>
</line><line>Engarde:
Hahaha... If you please, Mister Lawyer. Remember, it's not just me. Your precious friend's life is riding on today's verdict too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grr...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Maya...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Phoenix... Phoenix!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
M-Mia! Maya! How's Maya!?
</line><line>Mia:
...I don't know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't know...?
</line><line>Mia:
She hasn't tried to channel me since yesterday.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia... What... What am I supposed to do...?
</line><line>Mia:
... Well, like I said. For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But!
</line><line>Mia:
You can't give up! There's still some hope left.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Stop it, please! There's nothing left... Not here, not anywhere...
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! It's that accursed Engarde again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!? Look, don't call me anymore! I mean it!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>......You're really mean, pal.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaah! Gumshoe! I'm really, really sorry! Where are you?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>They let me join the investigation team and we're chasing after De Killer, pal!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! Then, you have some sort of lead...!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Sorry, but right now we've got zero leads on the guy... But we're not going to give up!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gumshoe...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Until the trial is over... until the verdict is handed down, we're going to do everything we can and find De Killer! If we can get Maya out, then you can get Engarde the <span style="color:#E16935">guilty verdict</textEffects> he deserves, pal!</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>You got that!? So you have to do whatever you can to make the trial last longer!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have to make the trial <textEffects>last longer</textEffects>?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>If you go at Mr. Edgeworth with everything you've got, then you two can draw it out!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, now I get it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>I believe in you, pal! You and Mr. Edgeworth can do it! So! Believe in us! We're going to give it all we've got, just like you!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Got it! Thanks Gumshoe!
</line><line>Phone:
<textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
...Hey, Phoenix. You understand now, don't you? You have something money will never be able to buy. Friendship. It's the strongest weapon in the world and you have it in abundance.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah! <textEffects>(Looks like we're coming to the end... I have to make the trial last as long as I can! Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)</textEffects>

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>March 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3</textEffects></captions>
<line>Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Adrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this card.
</line><line>Judge:
What is that...? It looks like a shell...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the calling card of a certain assassin.
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>A-Assassin</textEffects>, you say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What a surprising turn of events!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
But we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls the defendant's "mentor", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.
</line><line>Powers:
O-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what is your relation to the defendant?
</line><line>Powers:
Well, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.
</line><line>Judge:
Um, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.
</line><line>Powers:
Oh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?
</line><line>Powers:
Y-Yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(I... I didn't know that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Powers:
Um, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.
</line><line>Powers:
O-OK... Sure...

<line>Powers:
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What are you implying?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?
</line><line>Mia:
Looks like we're in another sticky situation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Mia:
A trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?

</line>

<line>Mia:
Do you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.
</line><line>Mia:
...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Powers:
Um, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("A little too much"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?
</line><line>Powers:
Honestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.
</line><line>Judge:
And why is that?
</line><line>Powers:
Because he gave the bellboy a really, really fat <textEffects>roll of cash</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A ROLL OF CASH!?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a "tip", Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Payment</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Payment...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? For the <textEffects>murder of Mr. Juan Corrida</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Then... Then the bellboy the witness saw...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, he was the assassin.
</line><line>Judge:
H-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Have I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Shelly... de Killer...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!
</line><line>Powers:
R-Really!?
</line><line>Judge:
...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?
</line><line>Powers:
No, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh?
</line><line>Powers:
Actually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAT!?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!
</line><line>Powers:
Yes, sir! Right away!

<line>Powers:
This time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!
And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!
Of course, when I say "room", I mean Juan Corrida's room!
Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!
Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!
I mean...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Thank you very much. That is all we need for now.
</line><line>Powers:
Huh? But I'm not done. There's still more...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
</line><line>Mia:
This is no laughing matter!

<line>Phoenix:
There is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!
</line><line>Powers:
But there really, really is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There really, really isn't!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you two are done being schoolchildren... Bellboys are for room service. There is no reason for them to be empty-handed, ever. Your Honor! I ask that the witness' previous statement be supplanted with this new one.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Very well, this court recognizes and grants the prosecution's request. Mr. Powers, if you could amend your testimony, please.
</line><line>Powers:
Y-Yes, sir.
</line><line><i>Change statement:</i>
"Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!" to "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!"

<line>Powers:
<textEffects>Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Mia:
In any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... he really is the assassin, you know?
</line><line>Mia:
Yes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Powers.
</line><line>Powers:
Y-Y-Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.
</line><line>Powers:
But... But... Isn't he really suspicious!?
</line><line>Powers:
He's got all those stitches, and... and...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?
</line><line>Powers:
*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.
</line><line>Judge:
This is... the crime scene...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a <textEffects>tray</textEffects> with a <textEffects>bottle of tomato juice</textEffects> on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!
</line><line>Powers:
Aah!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?
</line><line>Judge:
Uh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
I-I blame you for leading me down this route!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?
</line><line>Powers:
I-Is there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-"<textEffects>hand</textEffects>"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...
</line><line>Powers:
Oh yeah! I almost forgot!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Wh-What...?
</line><line>Powers:
That bellboy -- he was wearing <textEffects>gloves</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gloves?
</line><line>Powers:
Yeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?
</line><line>Judge:
Black leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?
</line><line>Powers:
S-Sorry... It slipped my mind.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!)</textEffects> So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!
</line><line>Powers:
Come on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?
</line><line>Powers:
*gulp!*
</line><line>Judge:
But that man... He received a large <textEffects>roll of cash</textEffects> from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing <textEffects>black leather gloves</textEffects>. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urgh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The rest...?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh yes, please tell us more.
</line><line>Powers:
OK!
</line>

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Their Second Meeting --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Powers:
After leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.
He gave something to the person inside the room.
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?
</line><line>Powers:
Yeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be "normal". Now then, let's get started, shall we? Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...

<line>Edgeworth:
I would like to summarize the testimony up to this point, if you don't mind. When the bellboy left the <textEffects>crime scene</textEffects>, he immediately went to the <textEffects>defendant's room</textEffects>. There, he handed a <textEffects>small item</textEffects> of some sort to the person inside. As for the person who received the item, all you could see was the person's <textEffects>arm</textEffects>...
</line><line>Powers:
Yes, yes! It was just like that!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Is all this really that important?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course, Your Honor. I think this is of the utmost importance. This is when whatever was removed from the crime scene was handed over to the client!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Powers, please, try to remember what it was the bellboy handed off.
</line><line>Powers:
Um... Well, let's see... Hmm... I think it was... No...
</line><line>Judge:
If you remember, please add it to your testimony.
</line><line>Powers:
Y-Yes, sir.

"If I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue."

<line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.
</line><line>Mia:
It's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What was the point of that pregnant pause!?
</line><line>Judge:
Where did that objection come from!? Well, speak up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, it was me, Your Honor...
</line><line>Mia:
What is it, Phoenix?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(OK Phoenix, deep breath...)</textEffects> Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?
</line><line>Powers:
Oh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...
</line><line>Judge:
At the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.
</line><line>Mia:
No, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!)</textEffects> Your Honor! A minute, please!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you trying to pull!?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?

<line>Judge:
I think we've heard enough. We now know why this bear figurine was at the defendant's mansion, as well as who it was that received the bear from the assassin in his room... Everything has become very clear. The client who hired the assassin to commit the murder was Mr. Matt Engarde! ... I see no reason for this trial to continue. Therefore, I will now hand down my verdict!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor, for your understanding. You see, Mr. Wright? You could not win against the truth, could you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(I knew it would turn out this way... After all, what Edgeworth has stated is the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects>...)</span>

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There is only one way for me to drag this trial out... The only thing I have left is this one dirty trick...)</textEffects> Your Honor. Right now, we have these <textEffects>two reasons to</textEffects> believe my client is a client of the assassin. Reason number one. He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a <textEffects>certain other person</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What are you saying...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!
</line><line>Judge:
The "real" client...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk. Is this all you have?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your theory. Who do you say is the real client of De Killer, and therefore, the real murderer?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Adrian Andrews...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!
</line><line>Powers:
Ah! Then... Then the "<textEffects>Nickel Samurai's arm</textEffects>" that I saw...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That could have very well been <textEffects>Ms. Andrews</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
But what about Mr. Engarde?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.
</line><line>Judge:
That's right... Then... finding this figure at Mr. Engarde's mansion...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Powers:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... What is your opinion on this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I can't even begin to count the flaws in the defense's logic. Besides which, there is no evidence to support it. However... I can't fully discount its possibility either.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>...What is with this trial...?
</line><line>...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...
</line><line>...I can't believe the defense would go so far as to pin the guilt onto someone else...
</line><line>...Yeah! Unbelievable! It's not something petty; it's murder of all things...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya... Even if the whole world turns against me, this is one fight I can't give up on!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! All disruptive parties will be forced to leave the courtroom!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. ... For the benefit of the defense, I'm willing to play along with his "what if" game.
</line><line>Judge:
His "what if" game, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution is prepared to challenge the defense's theory.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Even you must have thought it strange and wondered, "Why would the criminal want this little wooden bear...?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...)</textEffects> Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Absolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the <textEffects>true killer's identity</textEffects> will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Judge:
And who would that be!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.
</line><line>Judge:
I see... Well then, the court will take a short 10 minute recess. The prosecution will prepare its witness in that time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

</line><line>Phoenix:

<textEffects>Um, uh... We still don't have any leads, but...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:

<textEffects>(Huh? A tent!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>I could see a circus tent!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mia!
</line><line>Mia:
It looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So it was Maya that called you away!
</line><line>Mia:
She's locked in a dusty little room right now. But I could see a circus tent outside the window about 300 feet away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>There's only one, pal! The Berry Big Circus!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Wh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
And...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And?
</line><line>Mia:
I could see a mailbox under the window.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Gumshoe! There's also a mailbox!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Hmm... OK! What else?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
What else, Mia!?
</line><line>Mia:
I'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...
</line><line>Gumshoe:

<line>Judge:
Court will now reconvene.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
De Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. "Why this particular item?" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal. Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Currently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.
</line><line>Andrews:
I understand.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?
</line><line>Andrews:
Of course I have.
</line><line>Judge:
You have seen it before?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews. Could you please enlighten the court to this bear's secrets?
</line><line>Andrews:
Alright.

Actually, this is an elaborate puzzle.
If you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.
At its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.
Because of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.
You really can't tell that it's a small "jewelry box" just by looking at it.

<line>Judge:
So this figurine... it's a container of sorts, is it...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes. Looks can be deceiving, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. This is superb craftmanship. ...Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? I think even you have come to realize...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That there is one very important fact we have uncovered, and that is this: This bear is actually a "jewelry box".
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now that we have agreed to this point, there is only one logical question that can come next. And that is this: What is inside this box?
</line><line>Judge:
What's inside!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. That's what we are going to find out next. Witness.
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You are the only one who can open this. Please...

<line>Andrews:
I've opened it. Is this what you wanted?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is that? It looks like a... note...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's the suicide note.
</line><line>Judge:
The suicide note?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!
</line><line>Judge:
O-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?
</line><line>Andrews:
...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because it had already been taken by De Killer.
</line><line>Mia:
Everything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"What is written on the note...?"
</line><line>Mia:
That's right... At least, that's what I would think...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.
</line><line>Andrews:
I can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.
</line><line>Judge:
Then... What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Our intention, Your Honor, is to establish a <textEffects>motive for murder</textEffects>. Isn't that correct, witness?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.
</line><line>Judge:
My word...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde values above all else, his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!
</line><line><textEffects>Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...
</line><line>...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!
</line><line>...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!
</line><line>I guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is no margin for doubt here. Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this <textEffects>suicide note</textEffects>. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the <textEffects>defendant</textEffects>. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!
</line><line>Judge:
It seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk... <textEffects>(How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Why the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
The gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Unfortunately... I think he believes differently.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe a show of appreciation is in order.
</line><line>Judge:
H-Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this.
</line><line>Judge:
What is that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of <textEffects>spying</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
S-Spying...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in <span style="color:#E16935">my possession</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!
</line><line>Judge:
And...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
You... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... sort of...
</line><line>Judge:
"Sort of" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, "But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye..."
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the <textEffects>victim's house</textEffects> on a hunch... Using this...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> were found on this camera.
</line><line>Judge:
Matt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?
</line><line>Mia:
Well, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)</textEffects>
</line><line>...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?
</line><line>...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?
</line><line>...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!
</line><line>...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Chief!?
</line><line>Mia:
Have you figured out what you're going to do next yet?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What I'm going to do next!? <textEffects>(Does running away like a frightened child work?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
I know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very <textEffects>important thing</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, what is it, Mia!?
</line><line>Mia:
There is a piece of evidence that he really should <textEffects>investigate</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Something he should <span style="color:#E16935">investigate</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
I would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Alright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is this <span style="color:#E16935">piece of evidence</textEffects> that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
...I have an objection, Your Honor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. That was about the weakest objection I've ever heard, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!
</line><line>Judge:
You are beginning to sound desperate...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.
</line><line>Mia:
Hey... Isn't that what I just said!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you're telling me that I forgot something?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!
</line>


<line>Judge:
That is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Who knows?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I mean, sure, this "suicide note" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The <textEffects>handwriting</textEffects> on this "suicide note" has <textEffects>yet to be analyzed</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! You can't seriously be suggesting...
</line><line>Andrews:
Mr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a <textEffects>fake "suicide note"</textEffects> and put it into this bear!?
</line><line>Andrews:

Your Honor. The defense is indiscriminately accusing the witness again! There is no evidence linking the witness to the suicide note whatsoever!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Recall the witness' testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!
</line><line>Andrews:
Ahh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uuugn!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough! Mr. Edgeworth. Can you confirm the handwriting on this suicide note...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is as the defense has stated! The handwriting has yet to be analyzed!
</line><line>Judge:
If that's the case... It seems that yet again we have reached a point where a verdict is impossible.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Imposs... That's impossible!
</line><line>Mia:
This isn't good, Phoenix.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I didn't want to have to do this, but I don't have a choice. I request that both the prosecution and defense further investigate...
</line><line>...Handwriting analysis my butt! That's just the lawyer trying to buy more time!
</line><line>...Engarde is guilty! Look, any idiot can tell you that!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I humbly request another 30 minutes of Your Honor's time.
</line><line>Judge:
For what purpose?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe we can, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
But wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please! Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
... Very well.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
At the prosecution's request, this court will now take a 30 minute recess. But be advised that I will not allow another recess today.

<textEffects>R-Right! It looks like we just missed them, sir. But De Killer <span style="color:#E16935">left a few things behind</textEffects> by accident in his rush to get away.</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A few things...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Can we use any of them as evidence?

<textEffects>Ho ho ho. I thought you'd ask, pal!</textEffects>

<textEffects>I've got the things he left with me right now and I'm on my way over!</textEffects>

That's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>We don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! We can't let that happen!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...

I don't have any right to judge anyone ever again...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Phoenix:
I know my client is guilty. But what I'm doing now... I'm pinning the guilt onto someone totally innocent, and using the evidence to do so... ... It might be my turn to say, "Defense Attorney Phoenix Wright chooses death"...

Wright. It doesn't suit someone like you to cry useless tears. Whether you did your job well or not... That can only be seen after the verdict has been decided.

Yes, bailiff?

There's a phone call for you, sir. They said it was extremely urgent.

<line>Judge:
Court will now reconvene. I assume both sides are ready?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
</line><line>Judge:
...I can understand the defense acting like this, however, why do you also seem distraught, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... that is... It's nothing, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
It looks like something unexpected just happened to him.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, <textEffects>Mr. Juan Corrida</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. C-Corrida...?
</line><line>Mia:
Well, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That does sound very plausible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
What is this little item called again...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, a video camera, Your Honor. Well, a very small one, but...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, that's right. A camera. Ah, you kids and your fancy toys nowadays...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! Earlier, you claimed that Mr. Engarde knew of the existence of this note because he was <textEffects>spying</textEffects> on the victim. Isn't that right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that were true... Then this means Mr. Engarde would have known that the victim had forged the note!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Aaack!
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake."
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Judge:
So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's <textEffects>motive for murder</textEffects> was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gnnngh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unnnngh... As I figured...
</line><line>Judge:
Huh? ...As you figured...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I figured... It came down to this after all...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... "What next?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
What next...??
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I agree with you there...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh. Well, that's fine.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Unusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This witness is one who is <textEffects>perfectly fit</textEffects> to answer once and for all the question of, "Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?"
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is... It's... um...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes!? Go on! Who is it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
He's coming here? To the witness stand...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Is this alright with you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...)</textEffects> The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I wonder if it really is alright to do this...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.

<textEffects>Very good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
How can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Oh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.

<textEffects>I understand. Please wait a second.</textEffects>

A... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!
</line><line>Judge:
It looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>And what would that be?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
At the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
*gulp*
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!

<textEffects>...Very well.</textEffects>

</line><line>Phoenix:

<textEffects>Pray tell, what are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor? I should think I know my own client, and it is <span style="color:#E16935">Adrian Andrews</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Whaaaaaaaat!?!? Th-This can't be! On the phone earlier...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What's going on here...?
</line><line>Mia:
My guess is that Mr. de Killer just stabbed Mr. Edgeworth in the back.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Stabbed Edgeworth in the back...?
</line><line>Mia:
I'm sure in order to get an audience with this court, Mr. de Killer told him a different name... "Matt Engarde", perhaps...?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
This... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But you were the one who summoned this witness!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Grk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>My testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his <span style="color:#E16935">acquittal</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Judge:
H... Hmm...
</line><line>Mia:
Wow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No...
</line><line>Judge:
With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.</textEffects>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects></captions>
<line>Judge:
Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!
</line><line>Mia:
What now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our <textEffects>last chance</textEffects>... to save Maya...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! <textEffects>(Can I live with myself if I win this!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Andrews:
It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews...
</line><line>Andrews:
The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named <textEffects>you</textEffects> as his client.
</line><line>Andrews:
No! That's not true!
</line><line>Judge:
Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...
</line><line>Andrews:
But that's... That's...
</line><line>Judge:
You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.
</line><line>Andrews:
I... No... Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Andrews:
You... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yes, I know the truth...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Mia:
Phoenix...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.
</line><line>Mia:
You are a lawyer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer; a <textEffects>murderer</textEffects>! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. <textEffects>(...His <span style="color:#E16935">trust</textEffects>...? I never thought about it until now... I... I <textEffects>trust</textEffects> him...?)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
... Yes, you do.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Your opinion, please.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense requests that we be allowed to further question Mr. de Killer.
</line><line>Judge:
A-Am I hearing you correctly, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright...
</line><line>Judge:
But... But... That witness has <textEffects>cleared your client</textEffects> through his testimony! Your job here is done!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not done yet. To see through this witness' lies and find the truth... THAT is my job, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's still more evidence to look at... And I'm sure that once those pieces arrive here in this very courtroom... a <span style="color:#E16935">miracle</textEffects> will occur!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The trial will continue. Mr. Edgeworth. Please re-establish connection with Mr. de Killer.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Right away, Your Honor!
</line>
<hr />
<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...Has a verdict been reached?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Before that, we would like to talk with you a little more.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>About? All you needed from me was the name of my client. What else could you need me for?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well... Actually, we would like to hear everything you know about this case. This is how things are... usually done.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is he talking about? "Usually done"...??)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But... What shall we have him testify about now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. de Killer. If you don't mind, please testify about your client in more detail.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>You legal people and your procedures. Is it any wonder no one likes to go to court?</textEffects>

<textEffects>As I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.
One thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.
My client did it to frame another for the crime.

Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!
But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button".

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>What is the meaning of that attitude?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!
</line><line>Judge:
But how... How do you know that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
From this wine glass, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
The glass...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!
</line><line>Judge:
I see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Strangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... How strange...</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Why is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:

Yeah, I know...

Ah... Sorry.

We met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.
That is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />

<line>Phoenix:
So what are these "suspicions" you had? Why did your client request that night...?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I'm sure it was all for the <span style="color:#E16935">bear</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bear...?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>My client spoke of it. "I'm sure there will be a <span style="color:#E16935">bear-shaped figurine</textEffects> in Juan Corrida's room. I would like you to retrieve that item for me."</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He must be talking about this bear puzzle...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Inside that figurine was a <textEffects>suicide note</textEffects>. Naturally, the victim brought it with him to his hotel room. He was planning to publicly disclose its contents at the press conference, after all.

<textEffects>That is correct. And if I had not done the job that night, I would not have known where that bear figurine was...</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Witness! I would like for you to give us a few more details.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I always meet my clients as a matter of principle. I have never taken a request by telephone or mail.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And why is that?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>That's because I value the trust between a client and myself above all else. And the only way to establish that is to speak to the client while looking them in the eye.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Why he meets his clients is not important. And that wasn't the point. Witness, please stop side-stepping my questions!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Wh-What do you mean by that?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
My question was "Did you really meet Adrian Andrews in person?"
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I have already told you, Mr. Wright. I did. It was only through talking with him face to face that I began to trust him. That's when I thought, "I can trust this person as a client."</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It's true what they say about talking face to face. Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?

If that's the case... Witness, please include the statement just now in your testimony.

<textEffects>(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?

<textEffects>Yes, that is correct.</textEffects>

And that's when you thought "he" was trustworthy...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>How many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.</textEffects>

I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Wh-What!?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...! Wh-Why would you say that...?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because you made one very big <textEffects>slip-up</textEffects>... ...about her.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>So what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About "<span style="color:#E16935">her</textEffects>"...?</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a <textEffects>woman</textEffects>!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Ohoooooo!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.
</line><line>Judge:
But he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Ugnnn...</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe it has to do with her <textEffects>name</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Her name?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Yes, I see...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Umm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So does that mean you remember something different now?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Yes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)</textEffects>

</line>

<line>Phoenix:
So! What do you think!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... You may say, "What do you think?"... However, I am for all intents and purposes, a transceiver radio.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... That's right, you can't actually see the evidence...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Well, I don't think this was one I needed to see. I can hear the pure silence in the air there.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! How could I have picked the wrong piece at a time like this!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... In any case, let's continue with the testimony.

<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Whether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...Mr. Attorney.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Everything I have said from the beginning has been nothing but beneficial to your client. Which is why I wonder what is pushing you to continue with this cross-examination.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Could it be... That you are planning to <span style="color:#E16935">betray</textEffects> your own client...?</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I smell the stench of a backstabber. And should you turn out to be one...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-W-Wait! <textEffects>(Uh oh... This is looking really bad! I shouldn't press my luck. Alright, I have to think. Is this worth pursuing...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Witness, this is a very important matter. Please cooperate and tell us what these other "jobs" your client requested were...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... If it's truly that important, I suppose I don't have much of a choice. The <span style="color:#E16935">bear figurine</textEffects>.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bear figurine...?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>After the assassination of the target, I was to find that figurine. I was told that this job was just as important as the actual killing.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
And... Where was that figurine...?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>It was inside Mr. Corrida's suitcase.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
And then... what did you do next?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I handed it over to my client right away.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
You gave it to your "<textEffects>client</textEffects>"... Interesting.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... This information certainly sounds important to me. Witness, please include what you just stated in your testimony.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>As you wish.</textEffects>
</line><line><i>Add statement:</i>
"One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews."
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>de Killer:
<textEffects>One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews. But I know somewhere in that statement there is a contradiction... And yet... I know that if I present something trivial here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
...He will cut the connection on his end. If you want to make a strong point, Phoenix... You have to present strong evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's right. So now what, Dr. Wright!?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Witness, let's go over this one more time. You gave Ms. Andrews the bear figurine. And she told you to take the bear and wait for her at Engarde Mansion. Is that correct?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Yes... Where are you going with this...?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I think maybe you might have remembered a few things incorrectly.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is a battle of wits! I can't let up on him!)</textEffects> I don't think it is possible for Ms. Andrews to have been the recipient of this bear!

<line>Mia:
We've pretty much reached the end of our rope here...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Seems like we're still OK to me.
</line><line>Mia:
And that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Oh yeah... <textEffects>(All I can do now is pray that those <span style="color:#E16935">items</textEffects> reach us in time...)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. If you had really given the bear to Ms. Andrews... then this item should not have been inside it.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>"This item"...?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see where you're going...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yup, that's where I'm going...
</line><line>Judge:
Where is everyone going!? Do I need to pack a suitcase?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please think back to Ms. Andrews' testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Andrews:
And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
If even for a single minute, this bear had actually been in Ms. Andrews' hands... I'm sure she would have taken the suicide note out and burned it!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So that's where you two were going!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So by the very fact that this suicide note was still inside the bear... Tells us that your "client" didn't know how to disassemble the puzzle!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Which means...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It means, Your Honor, that it is impossible for Adrian Andrews to be the "client"!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Ohoooooo!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
O...Order! Order! ORDER!!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... Ungh... Mr...Phoenix Wright...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I... I'm sure I mentioned this before. How I hate <span style="color:#E16935">traitors</textEffects> above all else!</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I think your cross-examination has clearly demonstrated something to me. You... You must wish to break your end of our agreement!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
No! That's not...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>That's enough! If that is your intention, then there is only one thing for me to do!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please!

<textEffects>Gentlemen, ladies, please excuse me. I have a matter that I must attend to.</textEffects>

<textEffects>Mr. Attorney! Bring this trial to a speedy end, and I may stay my hand! Otherwise...</textEffects>

Nnnngh... Gnwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!

What in the...? Mr. Wright...? Are you...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I didn't understand this witness' outburst just now. Do you think there is a need to hear more testimony, or is this enough...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well... We should...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Edgeworth! We can't do this! If we keep this up... Maya... She'll...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
U...Ungh! The prosecution... I...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What has come over everyone? Even you are...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution... rests.
</line><line>Judge:
What is going on around here...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no further questions, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, I never thought I'd see the day. This is a most unusual situation... If the prosecution rests with no further questions... Then... the prosecution has <textEffects>failed</textEffects> to uphold its stance.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
If that is the case, then even though I am reluctant, I must believe that Mr. de Killer's testimony is <textEffects>accurate</textEffects>. That would mean that Shelly de Killer's client is... <textEffects>Adrian Andrews</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nnngh...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
If I end the trial here, right now, then your client, Matt Engarde, would be declared <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>. And in his place, Adrian Andrews would be charged with murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(M-Ms. Andrews... would be charged with <span style="color:#E16935">murder</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution has no further questions, so we will now hear the defense's final remarks. Bailiff! Please bring the defendant, Matt Engarde, to the stand!
</line><line>Mia:
The items from De Killer's hideout didn't make it in time... We tried as hard as we could, but it looks like our time has run out...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't believe it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
The outcome now lies in your hands.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Engarde:
Dude, did the old guy finally decide?
</line><line>Judge:
To be honest, I can't think of you as a truly innocent and good person. You have done enough evil to drive a woman to suicide.
</line><line>Engarde:
...
</line><line>Judge:
But... At least on the charge of murder, it would appear you are innocent.
</line><line>Engarde:
... Hah...! So, I guess even the old fuddy-duddy figured me out!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Engarde...?
</line><line>Engarde:
You were atrocious as a lawyer, weren't you? Giving your client away like this! And that "refreshing like a spring breeze" crap; it's just as atrocious, don't you agree? ... Anyway, get on with it and pronounce me innocent already. Right, Mister Lawyer!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But... But if I did that... Maya will die! But if I say he's innocent... Then Ms. Andrews will be charged as the <span style="color:#E16935">murderer</textEffects>! Do I say he's "guilty"... or "not guilty"...? Either choice I make, someone's life is going to end!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It all hinges on what I "choose"!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
If the person who hired the assassin was Adrian Andrews... Then your client, Mr. Matt Engarde is innocent.
</line><line>Engarde:
Hmph... There's no need to ask, old man. After all, my lawyer is going to say what I want... aren't you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't! I can't do this! But I have to decide something! I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart!)</textEffects> My client... Matt Engarde is...
</line>


<line>Judge:
We are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright! Matt Engarde, your client deserves an answer!

F-Franziska von Karma!!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What are you doing here... OWW!
</line><line>von Karma:
You see now, don't you... Mr. Phoenix Wright? This is exactly why you should NEVER take your eyes off of that scruffy fool!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you bring them? The final pieces... Do you have them?
</line><line>von Karma:
You should know better than to ask that, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. A Von Karma is perfect in every way! The evidence is here in perfect condition! Don't worry about Scruffy. He's fine, and his injuries are minor. All of the items are inside this.
</line><line>Judge:
What a filthy, old coat this is...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's Gumshoe's... I can spot his tattered rags anywhere...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I apologize for its ugliness, but there was nothing else to wrap the items in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've fought long and hard this whole trial... All for what is inside that raggedy coat... I'm sure that inside that coat, lies a crucial piece of evidence!)</textEffects> Your Honor! Inside that filthy coat... Are the defense's <textEffects>final pieces of evidence</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Your final... evidence!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
... This trial is already over. All that remains is for me to hand down my verdict. I do not believe that any evidence presented now, would change the outcome of this trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. It is our duty to examine every piece of evidence, down to the last. I request that Ms. von Karma be allowed to present these pieces of evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you are right, Mr. Edgeworth. I grant permission to do so. However, this one obvious rule applies here; If these items do not bring up any new points, then they will not be accepted by this court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Now, Ms. von Karma. If you please.
</line><line>von Karma:
These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... He must have been in quite a rush.
</line><line>von Karma:
Yes, Your Honor. De Killer left <textEffects>three pieces of evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Somewhere among the evidence we're about to see... There will be something that will turn this whole situation around... like a <span style="color:#E16935">miracle</textEffects>. I'm sure of it!)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
That is all we can hope for.
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
The first item is a <textEffects>pistol</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Does De Killer's pistol have anything to do with this case...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line><textEffects>Pistol added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
The second piece of evidence is this video tape.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I bet De Killer took that from Engarde Mansion...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line><textEffects>Video Tape added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
The last piece of evidence is this bellboy's uniform.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that a uniform from the Gatewater Hotel...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line><textEffects>Bellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
That is all I have to present, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It's just as I thought.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And... what is that, Your Honor..?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sure, were we under normal circumstances, these items from Shelly de Killer's hideout would be very important clues. However... Our question is not "Who <textEffects>did the killing</textEffects>?"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is, "Who is the <textEffects>client</textEffects>?"...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that is correct. And these three items do not tell us anything about that! Thank you for your hard work, Ms. von Karma. You may step down now.

</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! Please allow me to examine this new evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
Overruled. This court already has all the evidence it needs to hand down a verdict!
</line><line>Engarde:
Wonderful... Absolutely splendid. This judge is such a brilliant man, isn't he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is this the end...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I knew it... There's no such thing as a "miracle" in this world, is there?
</line><line>Mia:
I think you're wrong. I think they do exist. But you have to make that "miracle" happen. You've come this far! You can't give up now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...
</line><line>Mia:
Try... For my sake. Just think about it for a second. There are <textEffects>two ways</textEffects> out of this situation for us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(T-Two!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
The first... Make Engarde wish from the bottom of his soul for a <textEffects>guilty verdict</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Mia:
De Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!
</line><line>Mia:
The second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his "client"... Then he would let Maya go.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!
</line><line>Mia:
... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a "miracle".
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown; he's not accepting them!
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. Think things through from the <textEffects>other side</textEffects>. Isn't that what has always worked for us?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...)</textEffects> You mean... to <textEffects>turn things around</textEffects>?
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("The person who needs the evidence"...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
The defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the "<textEffects>truth</textEffects>". But there are people who have not seen them all. And those people do not know the "truth". That truth... It may be what will bring about the miracle in the end.
</line><line>Judge:
There are no objections this time, correct? Now then, I will pronounce my verdict!
</line><line>Engarde:
Why don't we all respectfully sit back and listen, kids.

Yes, Your Honor.

Please, Your Honor!

That's impossible! To turn this situation around in one try...
</line><line>Judge:
One try. That is all I will permit.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to try to remember... Everything that has happened up to this point... Think, Phoenix! Think! There must be a way to save Maya while taking Engarde down at the same time!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's not waste any more time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Who would you like to show evidence to?
</line>

<line>Judge:
I see. And now... Tell this court what one piece of evidence you would like to show this person!
</line>


<line>Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I think there is some merit... in showing this evidence to that witness.
</line><line>Judge:
... Bailiff! Please bring in the transceiver from earlier!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright! It looks like they got a hold of him...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Maya... She's OK, right!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Didn't I tell you to concern yourself with bringing about a speedy end to this trial? Now, if I understand correctly, you wish to show me one piece of evidence?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. One is all I need. I have here a video tape. It was found at your hideout.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I heard you injured three officers in your attempt to get this back.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>That was most regrettable. However, it was an order from my client. I was told to protect that video tape.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I thought so...)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I'm afraid I seem to have failed in that regard.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you know the contents of this tape?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I was sternly told by my client to not watch it. So I have absolutely no idea.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, you are on this tape.
</line><line>de Killer:

</line><line>Phoenix:
There was a video camera hidden at the crime scene. Your actions were being <textEffects>recorded</textEffects>.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Wh-What!?</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Is that true!? Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Who... Who was it that planted a camera...!?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, the only person who could have placed a camera at the scene of the crime... would be your "<textEffects>client</textEffects>" naturally.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That was... Adrian Andrews...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Be quiet and listen... Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your "client" specified a place and time for you, isn't that right?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Y-Yes...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
That was so they could film you.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... I had no idea. ... Mr. Wright. Why would my client do such a thing?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>I would like to know why...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why did Matt Engarde film the crime scene...? The reason "why" he did that is my ticket out of this whole mess!)</textEffects> There is only one reason why your "client" would secretly film the crime scene. They...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Your "client" once told me something very interesting. We were talking about you, and this is what they said.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Engarde:
But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all <textEffects>assassins</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Engarde:
Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Engarde:
Yes, that's where the video comes in. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Your "client" didn't trust you at all. They were thinking of using this video to blackmail you! What do you have to say to that, Shelly de Killer!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Gnnn...nnnngh... Ohoooooo! ... It looks like... It looks like I was being deceived from the very beginning...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... By a natural... That is the kind of person they are. Your "client" is a person who only thinks and plots of how to use the people around them to protect themselves from any and all dangers that may arise. That is the true nature of your "client".
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>...</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have one question for the witness.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Yes?</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You told us one thing numerous times during your testimony. You said that you detest <textEffects>traitors</textEffects> most of all.
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Yes, that's right.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But what if that traitor was your own <textEffects>client</textEffects>...? What would you do then!?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>... That's obvious. I would break our contract in that case. And then... That client would become my next target. For the honor of the De Killer name, even if it takes an eternity... I would follow that person to the ends of the earth to exact my punishment.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. That's all I wanted to know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So the <span style="color:#E16935">traitor</textEffects> becomes De Killer's next target... Ah! I get it... This is how we'll <textEffects>turn this case around</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>Mr. Wright.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes...?
</line><line>de Killer:
<textEffects>My contract with my client is over as of now. I seem to have a new job on my hands. I will now return to you, your precious item.</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
<textEffects>...What the!? I'm not an item!</textEffects>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Um... This trial appears to have come to its conclusion... However... I... Actually, I am sort of... I don't quite know what just happened there with the client and the witness and... Gwaaah! M-Ms. von Karma! Where did that...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She always has you in her sights. Now! I do believe it's time to finally hand down a verdict!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But before that, I would like to make one final statement. Sometime in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you.
</line><line>Engarde:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Needless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you would understand what I mean, if you watch this video.
</line><line>Engarde:
...H-- Help me...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, Your Honor! The verdict, if you please.
</line><line>Judge:
I-Is this alright with you, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Mia:
We have finally reached the end of a very long battle. Whether he's convicted or acquitted, there is no escape for him now. Go on, Phoenix. Plead whichever way your heart tells you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right, Chief.
</line>


<line>Engarde:
... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Guiltyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guuuuuilty!!!GGG--Guuiiillltyyyy!!!GGGUUUILLLTYYY!!GUILTY!!!GuiLTy!!guIIIltYY!!Guil--guilty!guilty!GUilTY!GUILTY!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
As always, it looks like we have uncovered the real truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(We? I don't remember you helping out much in this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. How is Matt Engarde?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have left Ms. von Karma in charge of his incarceration. I'm sure he's getting a full-course meal of whip leather right about now.
</line><line>Judge:
Very good. That was a close one, wasn't it, witness?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes... I plan to pay my debt to society for my own crime, Your Honor. ... This trial was the first time I had stood on the witness stand, and when I did... I really felt hopeless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If you're going to say you would "choose death", that is of no concern to me.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Andrews:
But... after that, when I was alone at the detention center... That's the first time I really saw myself and who I am.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Andrews:
And today... When the two of you used your combined strength to convict Matt... I... I felt like I had finally been saved.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
I am really happy that you two were in charge of this case. I really don't know how to express how I feel at this moment... This is... This is the first time I've felt comfortable with myself; with who I am. Thank you so much, everyone!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It looks like we have resolved everything at last. As for myself, there are still a few things I'm confused about... But everyone seems to be in good spirits, and that is good enough for me. That is all. This court is adjourned!

<line>Mia:
You were great out there, Phoenix!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What I did out there was right... wasn't it?
</line><line>Mia:
... This is the first time you've not gotten your client off. You got them a "guilty" verdict this time. But... You have to look past all of that, to what's really important. You now realize that there is something more than just getting a "not guilty", right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I understand now.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix, think back for a second. Think to the moments before Ms. von Karma arrived with the final pieces of evidence. Think about the incredible decision you had to make...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)</textEffects> My client... Matt Engarde is...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mia:
Is he "guilty"... or is he "not guilty"...? Those were your choices then. And your answer... Your answer spoke to what being a "<textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>" means to you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have good news. Maya is now safe in police custody!
</line><line>Pearl:
Really!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Pearls--
</line><line>Pearl:
You're telling us the truth, right Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-Yes... She's quite safe. She is on her way here as we speak in a patrol car.
</line><line>Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya's safe!! You did it! You really did it, Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
I... I believed in you. I kept saying to myself: Mr. Nick will save her... Mr. Nick will save her... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, um... Thanks.
</line><line>Pearl:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's wrong?
</line><line>Pearl:
Ms. von Karma...
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Why are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.
</line><line>von Karma:
How dare you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my "enemy"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death"...
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.
</line><line>von Karma:
Wh-What foolish nonsense...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so...
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
No matter how desperate the situation... instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it... I began to <textEffects>trust</textEffects> in that man as well.
</line><line>von Karma:
Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single <textEffects>truth</textEffects>. This I promise you.
</line><line>Pearl:
The "truth"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on "victory", who ran away into the night...
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah! Is... Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You really let me down...)</textEffects> When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.
</line><line>von Karma:
You pathetic fool!
</line><line>Pearl:
M-Ms. von Karma...
</line><line>von Karma:
I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is... an <textEffects>electromagnetic receiver</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You should keep this, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Umm... OK.
</line><line>???:
Nick!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
......! M-M-M... MAYA!
</line><line>Pearl:
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!
</line><line>Maya:
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Is it really that easy to do something like that...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... Don't mention it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Maya...
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Um... I'm relieved you're alright.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Umm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.
</line><line>Maya:
Heh...
</line><line>*growwwwl...grrrrr...urrrr...*
</line><line>Maya:
Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Where are we going!?
</line><line>Maya:
Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!
</line><line>Pearl:
Come with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uh, um... If you insist...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?
</line><line>Maya:
Don't be silly, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Maya:
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-Another feast...?
</line><line>Maya:
C'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-Thanks...

Now lookie here, mister snooty prosecutor! Don't ya reckon ya bullied Mr. Wright too hard!? If ya don't start bein' a lot nicer to him, he might just kick it... Tonight, even!

Umm... I'll keep that in mind.
</line><line>Lotta:
Well, come on now! Everyone gather 'round! Y'all are gonna get yer picture taken by a genuine professional photographer!

You know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? ...You really think so?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd... When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took <textEffects>4 things</textEffects> total, sir.
</line><line>Maya:
What?
</line><line>Pearl:
Four?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, I'm sure I put one of the items in my coat pocket...

Aw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?

Ah! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh... It's probably busted or something, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)</textEffects>

What?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmph. If anyone should be saying thanks, it should be me, Wright.

<textEffects>(I feel like words alone aren't enough here... I wonder if there's anything I can give him to express how I feel...?)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
You don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job.
</line><line>Pearl:
It looks like Mr. Edgeworth has left, Mr. Nick. Hey, Mystic Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Hm? Yes, Pearly?
</line><line>Pearl:
I guess you two can go back to being lovey-dovey, right? You and Mr. Nick, I mean...
</line><line>Maya:

</line><line>Powers:
Um, anyway... So, who's paying for this lovely dinner party?
</line><line>Maya:
As if you need to ask! Everyone say, "Thank you" to Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah... I'm kinda at the point where I can't even buy instant noodles, pal. So I kinda already put your name on the bill.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
</line><line>Lotta:
Yeah, I got me a situation just like that myself. There's this camera shop in this hotel, see... And I just bought myself this good ol' beauty here! It'd better be anyhow for $3,000!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
</line><line>Lotta:
Actually, I reckon ya bought it for me since it's on yer tab and all.

Yeah, pal! Time to let it all out!
</line><line>Pearl:
This is going to be the first time I hear the real you.

It's time to begin our quest of world circus domination sweetie!! And to let the world know we are serious, I plan to make a fabulous flight to Zimbabwe!
</line><line>Regina:
Hey Max! What do you think Zimbabwe is like? Do you think there are castles made of cake, and bunnies who can talk...?
</line><line>Max:
I think if there are any talking bunnies, even they won't laugh at Moe's jokes!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Moe:
I'm ready! I'm ready! There's no way these jokes are gonna fall on deaf ears. I'm going to be more contemporary with my humor! Moe Curls, R-R-R-Represent!
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>We've got our new act all worked out! Prepare for the "Hallelujah Chorus"!</textEffects>
</line><line>Ben:
...
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Say something will you! You're supposed to start this off! Get on with it...!!</textEffects>

...What's this!? Drat, it's just an ordinary electric razor recharging on its stand! I can't believe this. Really! How long do they plan on making me do this!? Ah, but it's Edgey-poo's idea, so that means it must have a deep, hidden meaning. But... Why do I get the feeling... They wouldn't forget about me, would they? Ah, it was never like this in the old days! Everyone thought the world of me! They used to call me Queen Wendy, and treat me like royalty, and any man who hasn't heard about this is going to feel the pain of my heel, yes they're going to feel the burn, and speaking of burn, playing with fire is very dangerous and because of that, three of the warehouses where they stored the scenery were burned right down and that caused a huge stink that

<line>Andrews:
I appreciate everything you and Mr. Edgeworth did for me from the bottom of my heart. Oh, that's right. I received a letter from Ms. von Karma. She said that after I get out, I should feel free to consult her about anything at all. I'm really thankful to have met everyone!

<textEffects>It has become difficult for me in this country as of late. As such, I will take a short leave of absence. If you would like to request my services, please be sure to visit my homepage. May we both be blessed with longevity.</textEffects>

<line>Where are you going... Franziska?
</line><line>von Karma:
...! How did you know I was here...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
With this.
</line><line>von Karma:
That's...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I heard you were planting things on a certain person. Things like tracking devices in his <textEffects>coat</textEffects>, for example.
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh, that's right... Speaking of that man... He told me something very interesting.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took <textEffects>4 things</textEffects> total, sir.
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
Four items...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems he put the last one in his coat pocket.
</line><line>von Karma:
He put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... What are you going to do now?
</line><line>von Karma:
... That's none of your business.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you running away?
</line><line>von Karma:
Shut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be "Manfred von Karma's daughter"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska...
</line><line>von Karma:
So many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>von Karma:
But I... I had to be one. I had to.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... You may not be a genius like your father... But... You are a prosecutor. You have been and always will be.
</line><line>von Karma:
...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.
</line>


<line>von Karma:
... You haven't changed a bit... You've always... You've always left me alone and walked on ahead without me. Miles Edgeworth... I've always hated you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>von Karma:
And then... Finally, my chance to take my revenge on you arrived. If I could win against that man... If I could make Phoenix Wright bow down in defeat... Then this "girl" you left behind would have risen higher than you! That was supposed to be my "revenge"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see...
</line><line>von Karma:
... You know, I can't do it... I can't change who I am. I can't throw away everything I've been until today.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe you can. Just like how Adrian Andrews did.
</line><line>von Karma:
Adrian Andrews...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were going to use her during the trial, right? But you... You were "dependant" on your father by using his tactics. Isn't that right?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Today, you chased after me, after I had left you behind all these years. And that's why we're standing here now, side by side.
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But I have no intention of stopping. If you say you are going to quit your walk down the prosecutor's path... ... Then, this is where we part ways, Franziska von Karma.
</line><line>von Karma:
... I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix Wright... One day... Someday... I'm sure we'll meet again in battle. Until then... This last piece of evidence that never made it to you... I'll take good care of this fourth piece... So I can give it to you... when at last we meet again...
