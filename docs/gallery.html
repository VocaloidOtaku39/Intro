            <h2>2018</h2>
            <p>Not only have I made digital art, but also physical art on pencil and paper! However, I preferred the latter during my high school years until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, which was when I decided to draw digital art to pass the time.</p>

        <p>After receiving a 3D pen as a Christmas gift in 2021, I loved it so much that I would go on to post many of my creations on Instagram. I also took a Photoshop class last semester, and I have been using Photoshop in my free time ever since.</p>
