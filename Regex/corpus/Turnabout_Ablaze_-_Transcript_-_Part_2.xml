<line>Edgeworth:
This is <textEffects>the national flag of the Principality of Cohdopia</textEffects>. And because it has the national flag on it, we know this to be an official government car. But the question we should be asking ourselves is what was a government car doing there?
</line><line>Alba:
Ah, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. So you were here all this time.
</line><line>Franziska:
Ambassador Alba...
</line><line>Alba:
Thank you very much for continuing the investigation, even at the time of night. Ah, if only I was even a tiny bit more careful... ...this tragedy would never have happened. I am truly sorry.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This wasn't your fault, sir. This had nothing to do with how careful you were.
</line><line>Alba:
You idiot, Quercus! You couldn't chase after a simple thief! Now then, let's get down to the real reason why I came looking for the two of you. I would like you to put the investigation on hold for a while. Can you do that?
</line><line>Franziska:
Excuse me!?
</line><line>Alba:
I heard you've apprehended the thief that turned this embassy upside-down. And we are in the middle of an event celebrating our countries' reconciliation. We can't exactly have the police and detectives walking around here forever. You're scaring the visitors away. So I hope that you can understand how I feel.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh... But we must finish our investigation and resolve the remaining issues.
</line><line>Alba:
Why don't we leave the rest to the Allebahstian and Babahlese police?
</line><line>Franziska:
Ambassador! We are so close! Just a little more and...!
</line><line>Alba:
Ms. von Karma. I'm afraid I've made up my mind. And without my permission, you can't proceed with your investigation, anyway, right?
</line><line>Franziska:
That's true, however...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As he said at the very beginning... ...this area can be considered to be Allebahstian soil. In which case, we are nothing but foreigners in their land. Is this really where our investigation ends!?)</textEffects>

Shifu! We found Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
</line><line>Officer:
Shifu! This way!
</line><line>Lang:
Yo!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... You're back on the scene rather quickly.
</line><line>Lang:
If I laid back and took a break, I'd lose the scent of my prey, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line><line>Alba:
Agent Lang! Why in the... Why have you returned?
</line><line>Lang:
Because I have to solve this case, no matter what.
</line><line>Alba:
Well, I'm sorry to inform you... Ah, and don't take this the wrong way; I don't suspect you personally... ...however, a member of Interpol was just found to be a thief, and so...
</line><line>Lang:
Grr...
</line><line>Alba:
Under these circumstances, I wish to put your investigation on hold. After all, I believe our own police can handle things from here. They are quite capable.
</line><line>Lang:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Arngh...! At this rate, our investigation really WILL come to a close!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Lang:
Heh...... heh heh heh heh heh......... Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ambassador Alba, I get it now. I really do...
</line><line>Alba:
Oh? I'm very glad you understand how I feel.
</line><line>Lang:
No, not that. What I was talking about was... ...I know who the killer is behind tonight's murder!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-You--
</line><line>Kay:
K-Know--
</line><line>Gumshoe:
T-The--
</line><line>Franziska:
K-Killer!?
</line><line>Alba:
D-Do you really mean that, Agent Lang?
</line><line>Lang:
Heh, wolves don't lie.
</line><line>Alba:
Th-Then who is it!?
</line><line>Lang:
Well, let me first say that I'm not talking about Mr. Coachen's murder. That was all Shih-na.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: "The truth lies not at the exit, but rather, shines outside the maze itself." The truth is unexpectedly simple. So let me ask you this: who do you think was DeMasque II's killer? Hmph, I'll tell you who... It was you, Franziska von Karma!
</line><line>Franziska:
I was the killer!?
</line><line>Kay:
Hey, wait! But that's impossible!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah! ...Although, that whip is actually quite... Yeowwww!
</line><line>Franziska:
Hold your tongue, and that ludicrous remark you were about to make!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Are you seriously accusing her of murder?
</line><line>Lang:
.........Yeah, I am.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He doesn't appear to be joking.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
</line><line>Franziska:
Y-Yes, he did... but what does that have to do with anything!?
</line><line>Lang:
I'm getting to that. Furthermore, in order to solve both cases... ...you moved around rather freely between Allebahst and Babahl, did you not?
</line><line>Franziska:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Franziska:
And where is your evidence that I am the killer!?
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph... I was just getting to that. Trust me, I'll show them to you in due time. Ambassador Alba. In order for me to bring this case to a close... ...I'll need to inspect your office one more time. Will you grant me permission?
</line><line>Alba:
.................. .........With things as they are, I suppose I don't have much of a choice, do I...?
</line><line>Lang:
Good! Then let's move out! Oh, and don't even think about running away, sis. My pack will be keeping a close eye on you, you can bet your bottom dollar on that!
</line><line>Franziska:
Hmph! As if I would have any reason to flee! But just so we're clear, your logic had better be sound... ...because I'll accept nothing short of a perfect explanation!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She seems rather upset, not that I blame her...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. I expected that you'd accept no less. But we'll see how long you can keep that nose of yours stuck up in the air like that.
</line><line>Franziska:
Arngh...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... As someone related to tonight's case, I request that you allow me to take part. And so that I may clean up my superior's mess.
</line><line>Franziska:
!
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph... I guess I should. The more the merrier, especially when it's the peanut gallery.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! In that case, I want to join in, too! I still haven't seen what it looks like in Allebahst, yet!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
If you let Kay in, then you've gotta let me in, too, pal! I can't sit around and do nothing when Ms. von Karma's in trouble!
</line><line>Kay:
Hey, Gummy! Let's have a competition to see who can save her first, OK!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
OK! I'll take you up on that! Oh, yeah! I'm fired up and raring to go!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...As a detective, I don't believe this is something you're supposed to be excited over.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. Sounds like this is going to got real interesting! Ambassador Alba... I'll be bringing these kids along for the ride.
</line><line>Alba:
...Very well. But I'd like you to keep in mind that this will be your last chance.
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph. I'll have this whole mess cleaned up before you know it. Now, let's go!
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>March 15, 12:53 AMAllebahstian EmbassyAmbassador's Office</textEffects></captions>
<line>Lang:
OK, now, let's first go over the facts one more time. Manny Coachen's body was found over in the secretariat's office in Babahl. The weapon that took his life was one of Allebahst's ornamental knives. And then, the body of DeMasque II, Mr. Ka-Shi Nou... ...was found here in the Allebahstian ambassador's office. Through our investigation, we found that the murder weapon was this Primidux Statue. And that this is actually Babahl's statue. This case... no matter how I look at it... Sis! If it wasn't you, then there's no one else who could have pulled this off!
</line><line>Franziska:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Franziska:
Agent Lang! Do you understand the full implications of what you are saying!?
</line><line>Lang:
Of course I do, sis. And I'm serious. You were on the trail of the smuggling ring, and you wanted any evidence you could find. And so, while people were distracted by the Yatagarasu's appearance, you snuck in here. That's when you two ran into each other. You and that other thief who took advantage of the confusion from the fire!
</line><line>Franziska:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Franziska:
Even if all that were true, how do you explain the movement of the weapons!?
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph... Don't worry. I plan to show that you're the culprit behind that, too. You had permission to investigate both embassies at will. With that kind of free reign, you could've easily taken the weapons across country lines. Hey now! Look, sis. I thought I already told you, I'm not messing around here.
</line><line>Franziska:
Arngh!
</line><line>Lang:
This case isn't directly tied to the smuggling ring... ...but Shih-na certainly is tied to the smuggling ring!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He is right in saying that she is a member of the smuggling ring... ...however, the connection between this case and the ring... Could it not be deeper than what any of us can imagine?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Grrr...! Let's get this ridiculous circus over with already!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska, you need to calm down. Because you only know the facts of the Allebahstian side of the case... ...I don't believe you can see the case as a whole, and therefore, solve it.
</line><line>Franziska:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But don't worry. I am taking this seriously as well, and I will prove your innocence.
</line><line>Lang:
That's the only way to be... Mr. Prosecutor! But can you come up with anything else that can top my hypothesis? Of course, your explanation has to solve the mystery of the moving weapons as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Of course, and I will. Let us now delve into the truth behind the murder of DeMasque II.
</line><line>Franziska:
You do understand, don't you, Miles Edgeworth? This isn't just a confrontation against Agent Lang. If you can't figure out how the murder of DeMasque II is related to the smuggling ring... ...then it will mean the end of our investigation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As long as I have no good counterargument to his hypothesis... ...then the best I can do is walk this thin tightrope and see what I can do!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Come on, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's get started!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, let's.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Border-Crossing Weapons --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Lang:
One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen.
And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue.
Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security.
The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
So as long as I can't explain how the weapons moved about, Franziska will remain a suspect?
</line><line>Lang:
You got it, Mr. Prosecutor. So why don't you stop giving me a hard time. Under these circumstances, who the heck can carry a weapon across country lines!? I've worked through every possibility, but there's only one that's plausible. Your boss!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, what I've learned from you just now is that you've lost sight of yourself.
</line><line>Lang:
Wh-What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By focusing too intently on that which is in front of us, we become blind to the truth. Don't tell me Lang Zi never said anything to that effect?
</line><line>Lang:
You prosecutor...! Who do you think you are, speaking about Lang Zi's proverbs like that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I don't need his proverbs. Because MY words are all you will need to see the truth.
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.
</line><line>Lang:
Oh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
DeMasque II was killed by Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go?
</line><line>Lang:
To Babahl...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies!
</line><line>Lang:
Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is that really so, Agent Lang?
</line><line>Lang:
Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors?
</line><line>Lang:
What other way...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence.
</line><line>Lang:
Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this "other route"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, I'm sure you familiar with this unforgettable photo.
</line><line>Lang:
Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well.
</line><line>Lang:
And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wouldn't dream of claiming that.
</line><line>Lang:
And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Arngh! <textEffects>(But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. "Not humanly possible"...? Eureka...!)</textEffects> Very well. You will have your explanation!
</line><line>Lang:
It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... <textEffects>Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.
</line><line>Lang:
You can't be serious!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Yatagarasu... or rather Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I know I did.
</line><line>Lang:
She "launched it through the air"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.)</textEffects> Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma.
</line><line>Franziska:
!
</line><line>Lang:
Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, I guess I did say something like that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is.
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth?
</line><line>Franziska:
How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about your movements in this room.
</line><line>Franziska:
Krngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case.
</line><line>Franziska:
............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements in this room until the murder occurred.
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl "Nooooooooooooo!"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... As you wish.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Movements in Allebahst --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Franziska:
As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.
After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office...
...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation.
After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office.

<line>Edgeworth:
Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct?
</line><line>Franziska:
Yes, of course.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. <textEffects>(For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.)</textEffects>

<textEffects>When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.</textEffects>

<line>Franziska:
<textEffects>There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence.
</line><line>Franziska:
It does appear that way.
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek!
</line><line>Franziska:
All I've done is state what I saw! I have made not a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant.
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. <textEffects>(How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I understand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require.
</line><line>Lang:
Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! <textEffects>The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence!</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these "hair sticks" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these "hair sticks" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case?
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Edgeworth:
Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight.
</line><line>Lang:
Aiya!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue!
</line><line>Lang:
Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!)</textEffects> Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape.
</line><line>Lang:
Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. <textEffects>And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lang:
Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect <textEffects>arrows</textEffects>!

<line>Edgeworth:
The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't.
</line><line>Lang:
Glad you understand. I feel you much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation.
</line><line>Lang:
What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you!

What did you expect from the second Yatagarasu!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Finally... Finally, we have reached this point in our discussion. For I present to you, that which was carried by the arrow from the crossbow!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh. I get it now, Mr. Prosecutor... I can see exactly what you are trying to say! You're saying that the wire was tied to an arrow and then shot into Mr. Coachen's office! All the way from the <textEffects>fifth floor</textEffects> of the Allebahstian Embassy... ...down to the <textEffects>third floor</textEffects> of the Babahlese Embassy!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
If what you're claiming is really what happened... ...I can see how Allebahst's Primidux Statue could be moved. Gravity could be used to move the statue down the wire from the fifth to the third floor. But then, what about Babahl's Primidux Statue? The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl! Going in the opposite way of gravity, from the <textEffects>third floor</textEffects> of the Babahlese Embassy... ...up to the <textEffects>fifth floor</textEffects> of the Allebahstian Embassy...! How do you explain that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Aha! I think I finally see how the gears behind this whole trick works!)</textEffects> Agent Lang, the "motion" used behind this trick... I wonder if perhaps you have yet to envision how it works in your head?
</line><line>Lang:
"Motion"? What motion?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I believe it was done via rotary motion. If the two statues were transported simultaneously...

Did I ever say that there was only one line of wire between the two offices? If you shot an arrow with the two ends of a wire tied to it, a circular belt can be formed.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... As you know, the Primidux Statue is a one-of-a-kind national treasure. And the fact that Babahl's statue is a hollow replica of the real statue... ...it would naturally be lighter than the real one, meaning that my idea is very possible!
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D.
</line><line>Lang:
...Hah! Ha ha ha ha... Grr!
</line><line>Franziska:
This proves it, right, Agent Lang!? That I'm not the killer!
</line><line>Lang:
Not yet, sis. I still haven't had my dessert yet. Right, Mr. Prosecutor?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The proof is in the pudding, as it were?
</line><line>Lang:
Pudding IS a nice dessert. So? Do you think you can do it? Can you prove that what you said is what happened? Because remember, if you can't... ...I'll be taking a certain someone back home with me as a souvenir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I agree that as long as there is no proof, my hypothesis remains just that. However... ...what I have laid out is no mere hypothesis, for there is one more piece of evidence.
</line><line>Lang:
One more? This should be interesting. You think you have a piece of evidence that will turn your hypothesis into fact...? Well then, let's see it, Mr. Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The thing that made it possible to create a circular belt out of a length of wire... I believe that it is right here in this very room! Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lang:
Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!
</line><line>Franziska:
The last piece to the trick... are two pulleys!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely! The ceiling fans double as pulleys in this case! And thanks to the fact that there is one installed in each of the offices... ...the ceiling fans made for the perfect pulley set for the wire to run on!
</line><line>Lang:
A...Aaa.........Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This must be it! This is how the smugglers bypassed the impenetrable security!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Grr... You really are something else, Mr. Prosecutor! I bet you've figured it all out already, haven't you!? You know who the bug hotshot that set up this real-life stage show is, don't you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The person who set up this rather large and complex stage show... ...needs to be someone who had foreknowledge of... ...the existence of a ceiling fan in both the Allebahstian and Babahlese offices. And that the passionflowers' support stakes could be used as arrows...)</textEffects> The real mastermind behind this case.........
</line><line>Lang:
Well!? Don't you dare make this wolf wait for his food!
</line><line>Franziska:
Why are you so hesitant, Miles Edgeworth? If you can't say who it is, why don't you present something like you always do!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A single point of the finger here, and this case will explode into an international incident. However! It's already too late for me to stop the forward momentum! It appears that I have no choice now... but to rush in!)</textEffects> <textEffects>There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow. Furthermore, the arrows that were shot by the crossbow... ...were plucked, as it were, from the flower box in this very room. They were planted so long ago that the passionflowers had the time to grow so big... ...that Ms. von Karma didn't even notice the arrows when she visited this room today!
</line><line>Lang:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On top of all this, the fact that the culprit knew that both offices had ceiling fans... ...tells us that the person has very detailed information on the embassy's layout. So as you may have already guessed, the person I am accusing of hatching this plan... ...is the person who grew the flowers in the flower box with the utmost care. Thus, it can only be you! Quercus Alba!
</line><line>Franziska:
!
</line><line>Lang:
!
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Franziska:
Are you out of your mind, Miles Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm certain of what I am saying, and I am sure that he is the culprit.
</line><line>Lang:
Heh... Heh heh heh heh......... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Tell me, Mr. Prosecutor. What was the ambassador trying to accomplish by doing all that stuff you just outlined? Why in the world would he need to use a trick like that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I understand your need to doubt me. However, there is one thing that stands out to me as very odd.
</line><line>Lang:
Just one thing, huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The one, single end result Ambassador Alba sought to obtain... If we were to examine the focus of this complex trick... ...I believe we will finally find the answer to everything!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve. However, to go through the trouble of swapping the real Primidux Statue for the fake... I sense a very shady reason for such a bizarre action! And who better to ask for that reason than King Primidux himself!
</line><line>Lang:
I see... Ambassador, we'll be examining that statue now, with or without your permission!
</line><line>Alba:
............................................................
</line>




<line>Kay:
Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think? Maybe it's because they look alike that he was picked to be the goodwill ambassador?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose that's possible. ............Hm? Take a look at this area around the base of his neck. It looks like a gap.
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! You're right! Maybe it's meant to be some kind of secret?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps it's possible to open the statue from this gap in its construction!
</line><line>Lang:
What...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Hurry up and open it, Miles!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Alright, here goes.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow! It really did open up! Hey, what's this thing that fell out?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm...? I believe a more thorough examination of it is required.
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
What in the...!? Is this...!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Hey! Is this what I think it is...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
It's a plate... for making counterfeit bills!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Somehow... it appears that we've at long last arrived... ...at the exit to this complex labyrinth! We finally hold within our hands, one of the <textEffects>counterfeit money plates</textEffects>... ...and the reason why the replica was smuggled into Allebahst to begin with!
</line><line><textEffects>Counterfeit Plate data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold. These two circumstances make the statue the ideal object in which to hide contraband. After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood. Well, Ambassador Alba?

"Subjectivity"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation!

Agent Lang! I demand an explanation!
</line><line>Lang:
Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning.
</line><line>Franziska:
You did...?
</line><line>Lang:
I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights!
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around.
</line><line>Franziska:
So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you.

Don't be such a sore loser! If you really are the head of the smuggling ring... ...then you should acknowledge your crimes with dignity!
</line><line>Alba:
Dignity...? That is nothing more than a fool's insincere display of strength. If you really wish for me to acknowledge my crimes... ...then I would like to first see some of this thing you call "evidence".
</line><line>Franziska:
Grr...!
</line><line>Alba:
I tell you... I knew nothing. Really. I didn't even know that a counterfeit plate was hidden inside that statue.

You swapped a real statue that vested in your country the authority to rule for a sake. It doesn't make any sense that you didn't know anything!
</line><line>Alba:
It doesn't make sense? Where doesn't it make sense? Can you prove that it doesn't make sense?

Gnnrk!

<textEffects>(The proof that Interpol has been after which points to this man as the ringleader... If we can somehow find that proof now, then we can see to it that justice is finally served!

The trump card and the video tape... <textEffects>(With those two items... ...we might be able to finally bring this man down. But...! The card is evidence from a case that Mr. Faraday hid away in secret... ...and the tape was stolen by Detective Badd from the police. They're both illegal evidence!

<line>Manfred:
Needless to say... ...we Von Karmas are commanded to achieve nothing but victory! And by any means necessary!

The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time.
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I no longer follow the path of Manfred von Karma... ...and I won't follow the path of the Yatagarasu! This leaves me with what? What creed will I believe in?

And which path is a "prosecutor" supposed to follow!? That choice... is one I must make by my own hand here and now!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!)</textEffects> Ambassador Alba. I wonder if you might recognize this.
</line><line>Alba:
...! Oh, I wonder what that card is? I've never seen that before in my life.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's a directives card used by the leader of the ring to relay instructions to his subordinates.
</line><line>Alba:
Oh? Is that what it is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This card was sent to the real culprit behind the KG-8 Incident, ten years ago... A man by the name of Mr. Manny Coachen.
</line><line>Alba:
.........Oh. So why do you have such a card in your possession?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because it was hand-delivered to me... ...by a certain Great Thief... The Yatagarasu!
</line><line>Alba:
The Yatagarasu gave that to you...? Don't talk nonsense, and let's be serious, Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof that the card contains directions from the ringleader?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll have you know that the card is not the only thing I was given!
</line><line>Alba:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This contains security footage that was shot just before the start of the KG-8 Incident.
</line><line>Alba:
...The KG-8 Incident...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The card and the video... These two pieces of evidence are what will seal your fate!
</line><line>Alba:
............Hoho, very interesting. I must admit I am very curious now. Very curious indeed in these "case-deciding" pieces of evidence you've presented.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The prey the Yatagarasu has been chasing all this time... now stands before me. I can't allow this man, who has had free reign for ten long years, to simply walk away. Now is the time for me to bring to fruition the valiant spirit that was given to me!)</textEffects>

<line>Alba:
So, what is this interesting thing that you wanted to show me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The trump card and the video tape... These two pieces of evidence together make for the ultimate hand! And this is where the real meaning behind Detective Badd's words will realized!)</textEffects> Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What you see here is security footage shot just before the KG-8 murder occurred. From this footage, we know that the card is a directives card from the smuggling ring. <textEffects>This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand.
</line><line>Alba:
I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof. Proof that the orders on this card were played out in that terrible tragedy! The blood belonged to the victim of the KG-8 Incident. With a bit of DNA testing, we can very easily verify that as fact.
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you have no objections... ...then I'd like for you to take a look at this next piece of footage! This car that passed by in front of the victim's apartment building... It's an official Cohdopian government car.
</line><line>Alba:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! If you could please magnify the footage! <textEffects>This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The shape of this pocket... and the directives card in it... It tells us that without a doubt, this person in this car is Mr. Coachen!
</line><line>Alba:
...Gnrk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The license plate on the car was also captured by the security camera. And with it, we can easily find out who was sitting in this car on that day, ten years ago.
</line><line>Alba:
Gnnrgh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which is why I can say with confidence that you were riding in this car on that day!
</line><line>Alba:
Arnnnnnnnnnnnngh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Alba:
..................Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! You've done well, boy, to make it this far. However...! About your claim that I was riding in the car at the time... That's going to be mighty difficult to prove.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How so?
</line><line>Alba:
The Principality of Cohdopia no longer exists. So naturally, all records from that time period also no longer exist.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nngh! That arrogance... What he really means is he's already erased all traces of them!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Are we finished here, boy?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The only weapon I have left to me now... is this piece of footage! There must be something here that I can use against him!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What the...! Ambassador Alba!
</line><line>Alba:
Yes, what is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were once an army man in the service of Cohdopia. And it was you who made the many missions you participated in successes, correct?
</line><line>Alba:
Hmph. Why the sudden back-handed praises, boy? Although, to be sure... ...the brilliant medals on my breast were awarded to me during the era of Cohdopia. But now, I am the only one who owns this particular medal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case... the only person it could be who is sitting in this car is you!
</line><line>Alba:
How do you figure that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By the medal captured here in this footage! It is clearly the same exact medal as the one on your chest!
</line><line>Alba:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This is how it will be... But I won't look back. For this is the path that I have chosen!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Gnnrrr... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You've moved me with your devotion to this case, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why is he taking such an arrogant stance with me?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
It's almost looking possible, isn't it? For the lot of you to have come this far... It looks like I just might lose our little game this time.
</line><line>Lang:
You might lose the game "this time"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador!
</line><line>Alba:
Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt.
</line><line>Franziska:
You're... going to confess?
</line><line>Alba:
And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result.
</line><line>Lang:
What the...?
</line><line>Alba:
Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're claiming it was justified self-defense!?
</line><line>Alba:
DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him.
</line><line>Lang:
Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance!
</line><line>Alba:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one!
</line><line>Kay:
Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence.
</line><line>Alba:
It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Alba:
I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should...
</line><line>Franziska:
But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body!
</line><line>Alba:
Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon.
</line><line>Franziska:
You hid it?
</line><line>Alba:
I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears.
</line><line>Kay:
Oongh... It's covered in blood.
</line><line>Alba:
He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense.
</line><line>Kay:
Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so.
</line><line><textEffects>Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
N-No way...!
</line><line>Alba:
Oh, which reminds me. I guess there is still one more accusation I need to resolve. Smuggling and counterfeiting. Unfortunately, all of that is my secretary's doing. I had no knowledge it was going on.

</line><line>Lang:
Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you!
</line><line>Franziska:
The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive!
</line><line>Alba:
Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Lang:
Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...!
</line><line>Alba:
That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!?
</line><line>Lang:
Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gnnrk!
</line><line>Alba:
And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts!
</line><line>Lang:
That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands!
</line><line>Alba:
These "crimes" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
You see now, don't you? I live in a whole different world than you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and fetch your eviction papers.

Arngh! Is there nothing we can do!?

</line><line>Kay:
I wonder why?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him.
</line><line>Kay:
Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently.
</line><line>Kay:
But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, he apparently <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Coachen&#39;s counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy&#39;s printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.">used the embassy's coupon printing press</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.)</textEffects></span> to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country.
</line><line>Kay:
Really?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here.
</line><line>Kay:
So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights.

What are you mumbling to yourself about...? Wait, what? The handle on this knife... Aaaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, it's the handle that was supposed to be on the blade that killed Mr. Coachen. The weapon that killed him was carried through the Theatrum Neutralis... ...in the very bouquet Ambassador Alba was carrying!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe we now understand... ...why Ambassador Alba was so nervous and agitated. It must have something to do with where Mr. Coachen was killed. A place where the Allebahstian ambassador was likely to meet the Babahlese Mr. Coachen. <textEffects>The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The only place that makes sense is here, at the Threatrum Neutralis.
</line><line>Kay:
What? Here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here.
</line><line>Kay:
But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further.
</line><line>Kay:
So what should we check out?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate...

You didn't miss anything... because there was nothing to miss. However, what IS missing is the image of Mr. Coachen entering his own country.
</line><line>Kay:
But wasn't his body found in Babahl?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It would appear that the true face of our final puzzle has finally revealed itself.

<line>Edgeworth:
! Ambassador Alba...!
</line><line>Alba:
I thought I had asked for you and your group to vacate the premises, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, I thought I should let you know that this theater sits on my country's soil.
</line><line>Alba:
You've had your fun, and I've enjoyed our little game. I dare say that you've even achieved a new high score. However, once you've recorded a score, that same game can never be played again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Your game is done, and it's game over.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No...!

</line><line>Franziska:
Where do you think you're going at this time of night?
</line><line>Alba:
After admitting to my crime, I was overcome with regret. So I am heading to the airport now to return home.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm afraid I can't let you do that. There are still too many issues we need to discuss with you.
</line><line>Alba:
You can't stop me, Mr. Edgeworth, and you know it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Palaeno:
Please, may I have a little bit of your time, Ambassador Alba?
</line><line>Alba:
Ambassador Palaeno...!
</line><line>Palaeno:
Even just a teeny-tiny bit is fine with me. The already strained relationship between our countries is in a precarious situation, you know.
</line><line>Alba:
.........Very well. If you insist. I will play just one more round with them, and see what they want. .........Not that they'll get any farther.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ambassador Palaeno...
</line><line>Palaeno:
Mr. Edgeworth... All I wish for is the normalization of relationships between our two countries. But there is one person standing in the way of that dream. I... I believe in you. You'll do what's right.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Thank you for your vote of confidence.
</line><line>Alba:
Now then, what was it you wanted to ask me about? I do have a flight to catch, after all. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit you to just one question.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's more than enough, because I only have one question anyway. I want to hear your alibi, about how you couldn't have killed Mr. Manny Coachen!
</line><line>Alba:
Ho! I see... You seem to have a good hand this time around. This should be fun.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This really is the very last chance we have to bring him down. I won't allow even an atom-sized contradiction to slip by!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Ambassador Alba's Alibi --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Alba:
Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here.
Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers.
But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time.
So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...So that is your alibi?
</line><line>Alba:
That is correct. It's simply not possible for me to have committed a crime in Babahl. Now that we cleared that up, I'd appreciate it if you would move out of my way.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I said, "Hold it!"
</line><line>Alba:
What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question.
</line><line>Alba:
What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing!
</line><line>Alba:
Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer.
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! As my subordinate, and representative of this country's prosecutors... ...you are forbidden to lose!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course. That is something I've understood from the start.
</line><line>Kay:
...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, I believe so.
</line><line>Kay:
The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!?
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same.

</line>

<line>Alba:
<textEffects>Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers.</textEffects>

<line>Alba:
<textEffects>In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Alba:
<textEffects>But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Alba:
<textEffects>So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
So Mr. Coachen was a "friend" of Ambassador Alba...
</line><line>Kay:
If that's true, then why did the ambassador kill him? It's not like in the case of my father where he ordered someone to do it...
</line><line>Franziska:
The problem we have here is we don't know what their exact relationship was.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. If they had complete trust in each other, then there is no motive for murder. <textEffects>(However, both men were very selfish, and I believe that is from where his motive arose.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If you want to know, I believe you did have a motive to kill. It was because Mr. Coachen had betrayed you. But you had your own reason, too. Namely, you wanted to pin the smuggling all on him. Evil begets evil, and because you were trying to test each other, it turned into this mess!
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Alba:
I don't believe this. You have a bad penchant for telling tall tales, Mr. Prosecutor. And if you're not, then I suppose you have some proof to support your argument?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I never use guesswork in moving my cases forward. It has been proven that this note was written by Mr. Coachen's hand. Shall we take a look at it? The content of the note is a request calling for the theft of Allebahst's Primidux Statue.
</line><line>Alba:
...Hmph.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By killing him and pushing all of the guilt for the smuggling onto him, you walk away spotless. I believe you understand what I'm driving at. You had more than a few reasons to kill him.
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Alba:
Are you finished with your hypothesizing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
</line><line>Alba:
Let's suppose I did have a motive. Even so, a motive or a thought alone can't kill. Isn't that right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I didn't expect him to resort to playing the semantics game with me... It appears that this is where the real battle will begin...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Now then, if you will excuse me...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait--!? What!?
</line><line>Alba:
I told you at the very beginning, didn't I? You only get one question.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Arngh.........!
</line><line>Palaeno:
...Ambassador Alba, if you could please give us just a little bit more of your time. It doesn't matter what kind of man Manny was, he was my subordinate. Which is why I would like for us to figure out the real cause of his death.
</line><line>Alba:
That is something for Babahl to figure out, and something to which I have no relation to.
</line><line>Palaeno:
.........!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now he's even turning down a request from Ambassador Palaeno...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Palaeno:
I'm very sorry, but it seems that now even my voice falls on deaf ears.
</line><line>Franziska:
There is no need for you to apologize, Ambassador Palaeno.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gnrgh! <textEffects>(We must find some way to stop him from leaving!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
It seems there are no further objections. In that case, please allow me to return home.

</line><line>Kay:
Hold it right there, Ambassador Alba!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
K-Kay...?
</line><line>Kay:
Like I said, Mr. Edgeworth... The Yatagarasu's legacy will live on through me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, but how do you suggest we stop him from leaving?
</line><line>Kay:
You just leave that to me! Ambassador Alba, do you recognize this?
</line><line>Alba:
No, and why should I recognize that tattered old organizer?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wait... Where have I seen that before...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
That is a clue my father, Byrne Faraday, left for us.
</line><line>Alba:
Did you say, "Byrne Faraday"?
</line><line>Franziska:
Mr. Faraday's organizer... Don't tell me this is the one from the second KG-8 Incident?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The one in which he wrote about the Yatagarasu's Key!?
</line><line>Alba:
!
</line><line>Kay:
Yes. This organizer belonged to the prosecutor you had Ms. Yew kill seven years ago.
</line><line>Alba:
Hmph. I have no idea what you are talking about. You say that like it was related to me.
</line><line>Kay:
Inside this organizer, he wrote up every detail of every evil thing you did.
</line><line>Alba:
What an amusing little girl you are, But that sort of trickery won't work on me.
</line><line>Kay:
If you won't believe me, then take a look at this!
</line><line>Alba:
And what is that toy there? .........! That's...!
</line><line>Kay:
This thievery device was used by the Yatagarasu, or rather, by my father.
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Kay:
Seven years ago, he used this when he snuck into this embassy.
</line><line>Alba:
...What...?
</line><line>Kay:
These two pieces of evidence that hold information the Yatagarasu dug up on you... If you go home now, I won't hesitate to send it all to Allebahst, right behind you.
</line><line>Alba:
Little girl, get to the point.
</line><line>Kay:
I want you to go up against Mr. Edgeworth one more time. If you win, then I'll hand over these two pieces of evidence.
</line><line>Alba:
Yatagarasu...! Ever the thorn in my side.........!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay, does that organizer really contain any information on his dirty dealings?
</line><line>Kay:
It's nothing case-breaking, really.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, then it was just a bluff.
</line><line>Kay:
Even if it was, we still can't let all the info my father and Uncle Badd found go to waste! Plus, just the existence of Little Thief is troublesome enough for him.
</line><line>Franziska:
Those two pieces... Aren't they keepsakes of your father?
</line><line>Kay:
It's OK! I believe in Mr. Edgeworth! He'll come out on top in the end!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay...
</line><line>Kay:
When the going gets tough... someone's gotta be there to put the wind back in your sails!
</line><line>Franziska:
After all this time, you're still quite the feisty one. I appluad your powerful nature. I refuse to lose this, too. Ambassador Alba! You won't be returning home until you give us further testimony!
</line><line>Alba:
How dare you all... Barring a person like me...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ambassador Alba, your testimony, if you please.
</line><line>Alba:
Gnrk............! Alright, but this is the absolute last. Then, even if you use all the power of Ambassador Palaeno's office, you won't stop me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I can't let this opportunity Kay has created for me go to waste!)</textEffects>

The last time I met with Mr. Coachen was here at the Theatrum Neutralis.
After that, I was in Allebahst the rest of the time, as I stated earlier.
In any case, I did not see Mr. Coachen again after that.
So you see, there is no time span in which I could've killed him. Wouldn't you agree?

<line>Alba:
Now, since you people were practically begging, I'll allow you to question me.
</line><line>Kay:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, but no matter. We can't allow this chance to escape us!
</line><line>Alba:
I will warn you though, you've reached the end of my patience. Waste my time with any insane questions, and you will be punished.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........! So any needless pressing or presenting will cost more to our case?
</line><line>Franziska:
In that case, the only thing you can do is to present the correct evidence. Understood?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........Of course. I don't intend to let him intimidate me! <textEffects>(I know Mr. Coachen was killed before he returned to Babahl. In which case, there is only one statement to which I need to present the evidence!)</textEffects>

So if the only place he met the victim was at this theater... ...then when was he killed?

We know that Mr. Coachen didn't return to Babahl alive. Which means that the only time he could've been killed is when they were both there.

And that means that he was planning to kill Mr. Coachen from the start.

It's a rather nice picture, isn't it? It was to commemorate the restoration of relations between our nations.

Oh, it's commemorative, alright. One that captures the proof I need to show that it was you who committed the murder.

This is the knife that killed Mr. Coachen.

!

I see you recognize it, as well you should, for it was you who brought it to this theater. You hid it in among the flowers you were to give to the Steel Samurai! Meaning that you killed Manny Coachen here, at the theater!

Sorry, but you're not going anywhere... Mr. Alba.

You have been relieved of your duties as ambassador, Mr. Alba.

Wh...
</line><line>Franziska:

</line><line>Lang:
You can't be arrested simply because you're an ambassador? In that case, I thought I'd strip you of that title. You underestimated me, a descendant of the founder of detainment philosophy, Lang Zi. Four thousand years of deeply entrenched connections and networks around the world... ...have really paid off.
</line><line>Alba:
It can't be... I don't believe this... My ambassadorship... has been revoked.........!?

Haa ha ha ha! Looks like you're finally coming to grips with your new standing.

So what if I am no longer an ambassador? You still don't have any evidence on me! The fact remains that you cannot arrest me!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh, I'd expected no less from you, the boss of the smuggling ring. Well, the rest is up to you, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood!
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh... You say that I killed Mr. Coachen in the theater. But even if it's true that there was a knife in my bouquet... ...I left that bouquet in the theater. So anyone could've taken it out from there and used it, right? Besides, the claim that he was killed here itself is odd. After all, wasn't his body discovered in Babahl? Are you claiming that I carried his body all the way over there? Hmph, preposterous!

<line>Edgeworth:
Actually, I do believe there was a way to transport the body out of the theater. Perhaps you should give this a look!

It's <textEffects>footage from a security camera</textEffects> that captured the state of the immigration area.

Just letting you know that we're not the only ones watching your every movement.

Now, if you could take a good look at this section here. This lump here inside the pushcart... Do you know what's causing it?

Should I? Because I don't.

<line>Alba:
Wh-What is the meaning of showing me that...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's to say that the unnatural bulge in the pushcart is Mr. Coachen's body. You had the Steel Samurai wheel his body away from the real crime scene!
</line><line>Alba:
Gahahahahahaha! What a guess! But I wonder if you have any evidence to support it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I admit that for now, it is but a hypothesis, however...!

Detective Gumshoe. Is that the Steel Samurai's pushcart?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! I found it in the <textEffects>open-air stage</textEffects> area!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So that's where you went...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The detective's spirit that pops left me with...! I thought I'd follow my gut and go with it, sir! So, Mr. Edgeworth!? Is this worth anything to the case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... It just might play a major role in solving this case, Detective! <textEffects>(But something isn't right. I thought that the entire Samurai Family... ...was in <span style="color:#E16935">Allebahst</textEffects>.)</span> Where exactly in the open-air stage area did you find this pushcart?

I found it just there at the edge of the stage, sir.

Oh? Well, let's leave that for now and examine the inside, Detective.

Yes, sir!

..................

I believe you understand what this means, correct? You killed Mr. Coachen at this theater, and then placed his body inside the pushcart. And then... ...you forced to Steel Samurai to unwittingly move the body for you!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were scheduled to make a speech in Allebahst... ...meaning it was difficult for you to make a stop in Babahl. However, what if you moved the body to Allebahst? Because it was your embassy, you could keep an eye on it, and tamper with the evidence. And then you smuggled it out of Allebahst!
</line><line>Alba:
N-Noooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If I can show how you moved the body from Allebahst and Babahl... ...then I win.
</line><line>Alba:
But you can't! The security between the two countries is incredibly tight!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll be the one to judge whether I can or cannot prove it. And so I ask you to provide us with... ...testimony regarding your movements after your return to Allebahst!
</line><line>Alba:
Grrrngh...!
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... Have you figured it out? Do you know how the body was moved...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
To be honest, I have nothing to support my hypothesis at this time. However, I don't believe I've made a mistake in my logic up to this point. Which means.........!
</line><line>Franziska:
There is no question that can't be answered, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The Primidux Statue was smuggled successfully through a brief flight through the air. So why shouldn't there be an answer as to how the body was moved? Which means that there must be a logic flaw somewhere I can exploit!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Iron Infant is positively soaked in water. Why do you think that is? It's because he was fished of a pool, and not just any pool; it was the Babahlese one. I think it's pretty obvious at this point what must be true. The water reservoirs in the two courtyards are connected!

Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back! H-Hey... Don't tell me... you guys figured everything out without me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We did, thanks to this hero of justice's son. Even if he is just a doll, he managed to help foil the villain.

</line><line>Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Look, I don't want to say this, but... ...it's kinda unlikely that the body just happened to have passed on through to Babahl. This guy's a doll, and he's small, so I can believe it made it, but...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........! <textEffects>(He has a point.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Heh... Heh heh heh. Yes, that's right. I'm glad someone here understands. Mr. Edgeworth, are you going to next propose that a dead body can swim through a pipe?
</line><line>Lang:
You see, Mr. Prosecutor? Our chase after this man... ...is far from over!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang...!
</line><line>Kay:
Why is he helping Mr. Alba out now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's not. He realized a flaw in my argument, and is helping to move the logic along. <textEffects>(In which case......... I should return the favor and find an answer!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
And another thing! Mr. Coachen's body was found in his office in Babahl. So what happened to his body after it was transported to the open-air stage?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Mr. Alba had an <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects> in Babahl, remember?
</line><line>Lang:
You mean... Shih-na, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
With her there, you can see how it was possible to move the body up to the office.
</line><line>Alba:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Alba:
Are you seriously claiming that she swam through the connecting pipe with the body?
</line><line>Kay:
He's right. Ms. Shih-na would drown if she did that!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's hard to imagine that she swam through the connecting pipe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
It looks like your hypothesis about how the body was moved is still only half-baked. In the end, it's all just the befuddled musings of an accusatory man. Now then, I believe you should give up and allow me passage. Because, from the start, there was no feasible method of transporting the body!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Lang:
.........Mr. Prosecutor. Recall Shih-na's movements.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh.........! <textEffects>(What was happening in the embassy around the time Ms. Shih-na was in Babahl...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ooh... if only there was a way to get rid of the water in the pool...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Get rid of the water...? Aha! That's it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Now, I believe this time we really are done, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Unfortunately for you, it's far from over, Mr. Alba!
</line><line>Alba:
You are a most persistent man. Are you saying that you've thought of a way to move the body through the water?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Move the body through the water? That is completely unrelated to how it was done.
</line><line>Alba:
Excuse me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The reason I say that is because... there wasn't any water there at the time!
</line><line>Lang:
What do you mean, "there wasn't any water"...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just what it sounds like. <textEffects>Tonight's events made it possible to drain the water, allowing the body to be moved!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Tonight, <textEffects>the Yatagarasu set fire</textEffects> to a variety of locations in the Babahlese Embassy. In order to put the fires out, much of the <textEffects>reservoir's water</textEffects> was used. Of course, when the water was used, the reservoir's water level went down... If enough water was drained, the connecting pipe could be used to traverse the border!
</line><line>Alba:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Alba:
Hmph... So what!? The water level went down? The reservoirs were connected? Does any of this matter? You can't prove any of this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Pretending to be ignorant won't work with me. We both know what kind of situation we're in right now. Even in a game, there comes a critical, game-changing moment. A moment in which you hit a wall that you must overcome in order to beat the game.
</line><line>Alba:
I haven't lost yet.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I've found the route you used to smuggle the body, and that route will lead to your defeat!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Even if all the water was used by the fire fighting effort... ...you still can't really call that a smuggling route.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........Hmph. I know that.
</line><line>Lang:
Ha ha ha! I should've figured that you would notice. Hey, Mr. Alba, how deep are those pools, anyway?
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. I'll have you know those pools are extremely deep. And there are no ladders or footholds along the walls, either.
</line><line>Lang:
It would be difficult for Shih-na to hold the body and climb up out of the pool...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Ladders or footholds along the walls? There was no need for such things.
</line><line>Alba:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If one were to use a certain something, they could go up or down in the pool at will.
</line><line>Lang:
Oh? It looks like you've got an answer already. Well? What are you waiting for, Mr. Prosecutor? Enlighten us already!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The way in which Ms. Shih-na and the body were able to rise up to ground level... If there was a way to control the water level, that could be the way the body was moved!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This was used so that the body and Ms. Shih-na could move up and down in the pool!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba used the <textEffects>fountain spouts</textEffects>, in a manner of speaking.
</line><line>Lang:
He used the fountain spouts...? How so?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The water level in the pools can be controlled by opening and closing the spouts. Ms. Shih-na and the body were lifted upward by their <textEffects>buoyancy in water</textEffects>. The fire on the Babahlese side, and the fire fighting effort... These were set in motion all for the sake of smuggling Mr. Coachen's body!
</line><line>Alba:
.........Gnnnnnnrk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Shall I show you where the final destination of my train of logic leads!? First, Mr. Alba <textEffects>closed</textEffects> the fountain spouts in advance, in preparation of things to come. Then, he took the pushcart that was brought to the rose garden... and pushed it, along with the Iron Infant and Mr. Coachen's body, into the pool. At this time, Ms. Shih-na was busy conveniently starting the first fire in Babahl. She then made for the open-air stage's pool to wait for the fire fighting effort to begin. When the firefighters used the water in that pool, the water level went down... ...and by the time the fire was put out, the pipe between the two pools was exposed! This is when she pushed the pushcart from Allebahst into Babahl. Once that was accomplished, Mr. Alba simply opened the fountain spouts once more... ...and the water level rose up to its original level, along with Ms. Shih-na and the body. After that, Ms. Shih-na used the pushcart to carry the body up to the secretariat's office. There is an elevator in the embassy, after all. So you see... ...even with her small frame, she could've easily transported Mr. Coachen's body. And that wraps up my thorough explanation of how the body was moved!
</line><line>Alba:
Gnnn... Gnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Well, <textEffects>Ex-Ambassador</textEffects> Alba? What do you think? Not so untouchable without your precious extraterritorial rights to protect you, are you?
</line><line>Kay:
I knew you could do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Way to fight back!
</line><line>Alba:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Alba:
You accuse me of moving the body across country lines...! But when you get down to the nitty-gritty, you don't have what it takes to indict me!
</line><line>Kay:
The "nitty-gritty"...? What does the old man want now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Proof... I believe is what he seeks.
</line><line>Alba:
Yes. Proof. Without any, who is to say whether or not any of what you said really happened?
</line><line>Kay:
He wants proof? What are we going to do, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is no need to worry. I've had all the proof we need all along. <textEffects>(The body wasn't the only thing to do through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...so, too, did I find one other item there. And that piece of evidence is what will prove that the pools were the smuggling route!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This was another thing that was smuggled over to Babahl's open-air stage area!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Alba:
...And what exactly is this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... You have no idea, do you? This little piece that I found on the Babahlese side will be your undoing.
</line><line>Alba:
A guitar pick? Would you care to explain how that is going to "do me in", as it were?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Much to your chagrin, perhaps, but this is not a guitar pick.
</line><line>Alba:
Wh...What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is something I found at the open-air stage which was transported with the body. I naturally assumed that you would recognize it... since you took a photo with it, after all. <textEffects>But since you don't, allow me fill you in on what I found at the stage actually belongs to!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen. On the handle of this knife, there is a beautifully blooming flower. However, it would appear that <textEffects>it's missing a single petal</textEffects>.
</line><line>Alba:
Gnn...nnrrgh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, let's see what happens when we try to fit this "pick" in that open slot.
</line><line>Kay:
It's a perfect fit!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I assume that the petal must have fallen off of the flower during Mr. Coachen's murder. And then, it was accidentally placed into the pushcart along with Mr. Coachen's body.
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Oh, I assure you it's more than just a story. Because for some odd reason, this flower petal was wet when I found it.
</line><line>Alba:
It was wet... you say...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, and the only place it could've gotten wet from is the open-air stage's pool! Now I ask you, how did a part of the weapon which was smuggled into the theater... ...wind up in the open-air stage area on the Babahlese side of the embassy? I don't think I need to waste any words explaining this, as this petal explains it all for me. It proves that someone went from the rose garden's pool on through into Babahl!
</line><line>Alba:
Impossible!!!
</line><line>Lang:
The people of Zheng Fa have been waiting to see you, face to face, Mr. Alba. I'll tell everyone back home we'll be there soon. You should be happy.
</line><line>Alba:
I... This... Why!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why? It's a little late to be asking that question. You should've known from the very beginning... ...when you took your first life! No matter how you may plot, or how you may try to cover it all up... ...you can never hide from your crime and what you've done. Because we're here to see to it that justice is served to people like you.

You... can't call what you've given a "perfect argument"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..................
</line><line>Kay:
You know... ...I don't think this guy is going to ever admit to his wrongdoings, Mr. Edgeworth. Because he values himself above all else. People who can't be negotiated with or people who refuse to admit when they've lost... I don't believe those kinds of people really exist because everyone breaks eventually...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're right. In that case, I have no choice but to use all of the evidence I have. I'll use it all until he breaks under the weight of his crimes! Mr. Alba, I request that you testify once more.

You little irritating gnat. Do you think you can trip me up by asking the same question over and over?

That was not my intention. Your testimony is more than sufficient. However, I believe it would be wise for you to take a look at this.
</line><line>Alba:
The Samurai Spear? What about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This spear... actually never made it on-stage today.
</line><line>Alba:
...E-Excuse me...?

Heh... Unfortunately for you, tonight's Steel Samurai... ...happened to be a goof of a young man with an abundance of useless hot-bloodness.

?

Having said that, said useless man bent the spear during his rehearsal this evening. Kay, do you remember what the Steel Samurai's special move was tonight?

It was the "<textEffects>Steel Samurai Sushi Slash</textEffects>"!

Correct. Because he couldn't use the spear, a last-minute change was made. Had you been watching the show, you would've known the move that WAS used.

...Gnrk...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! You didn't watch even a single minute of the Steel Samurai stage show tonight, did you!?
</line><line>Alba:
G.........Gnnnn... Gnnnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Lang:
Aha! So if he wasn't watching the show tonight...
</line><line>Franziska:
...Then it opens up the possibility that he was busy killing Mr. Coachen instead!
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So where were you during the show? I demand an answer, now!
</line><line>Alba:
..................Heh. Heh heh heh heh heh......... Ahaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just what is so funny!?
</line><line>Alba:
You're so sloppy. And so are your conclusions. I still insist that I watched the show. Or most of it, in any case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "most of it"...?
</line><line>Alba:
Ah, you see, during the show, I left my seat for a spell to visit the bathroom. I assume that was when that dramatic scene was played out on-stage.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Th-That is the lousiest, lamest excuse I've ever heard in my life, pal!
</line><line>Lang:
Arngh! Just because he got the name of the move wrong... ...we can't really use that as proof that he didn't watch the show at all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk............!
</line><line>Alba:
As a fan of the Steel Samurai, I had wanted to watch the entire show... Honest!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
As a "Steel Samurai fan"...? For someone who wasn't even in his seat for the climax of the show...! You have no right to call yourself a Steel Samurai fan, ever!

</line><line>Kay:
Wh-Who was that just now?
</line><line>Larry:
It would be I, young ladyyyyy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Larry! What are you doing interrupting me like that!?
</line><line>Larry:
Edgeeeeeey! Just hold for a second, I beg! You may never accept this old man as a Steel Samurai fan... ...but I totally think he's a <textEffects>Steel Samaniac</textEffects>!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um, what exactly is a "<textEffects>Steel Samaniac</textEffects>", pal?
</line><line>Franziska:
I believe he meant to say "<textEffects>Steel Samurai maniac</textEffects>".
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah! And trust me, I know a real fan when I see one, because I'm the Steel Samurai!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I will never acknowledge you as the true Steel Samurai!
</line><line>Kay:
What are you getting so worked up over, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Alba:
It appears that the real Steel Samurai recognizes me as a fan. As well he should, for I am a fan! It's not as though I missed the entire show. It was a most amazing show, filled with the spirit of the young and the young at heart.
</line><line>Kay:
Hmph. The sarcasm dripping from his long, wooden nose couldn't run any ticker.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Getting the name of the move wrong only proves that he didn't watch the last scene. What I really need here is something more definitive! Something that links Mr. Alba directly to the murder of Mr. Manny Coachen!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
You know what, gramps? You're really something else!
</line><line>Alba:
I'm honored to receive such praise from the Steel Samurai, but what is it for?
</line><line>Larry:
Well, I was just wondering how you found out about the "Early Summer Rain Jab". That move is a bit of a secret that only a small portion of the staff know about.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wait, it was a secret...?)</textEffects> Larry! Wait, what did you just say!?
</line><line>Larry:
Huh? Did I say something stupid again?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you say that the "Early Summer Rain Jab" was actually a secret...?
</line><line>Larry:
Well, maybe I shouldn't have said "secret"... It's more like we only decided on the name of the move right before the start of the show.
</line><line>Kay:
Right before?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah! The stage director was going nuts because we were supposed to debut the move! About 5 minutes before the show, we threw it up on the dressing room's white board. "Early Summer Rain Jab"! That's kinda how we decided the name of the move. But, by that time, I'd already bent the spear, so I guess the whole thing was kinda pointless.
</line><line>Franziska:
All of you Steel Samurai actors are the same. The director has my complete sympathy.
</line><line>Larry:
So basically, because we changed the move to the Sushi Slash... ...we kinda pretended that the Early Summer Rain Jab didn't exist at all! I mean, it'd be had if someone found out we'd changed the move, so we made it a secret.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So basically, a gag order was issued for publicity's sake...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
It almost makes the "Early Summer Rain Jab" sound like a lost art!
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah, which is why I think most of the staff haven't even heard of the move.
</line><line>Alba:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Alba:
Hold those lips of yours still...!
</line><line>Larry:
What the heck, old man!?
</line><line>Alba:
I've done nothing but listen, and from what I can tell, it's all very unrelated to the case. It's also very tedious and a pointless exercise in wasting time, much like a kids' show.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba. I believe the one who should be quiet now is you.
</line><line>Alba:
How dare you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suspect that you've already noticed... ...exactly what the very severe implications are in this man's testimony!
</line><line>Alba:
Hah! So now you're trying to bully me, huh? There are no implications to be read into a behind-the-scenes story of a kids' show!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Don't even think about trying to slither your way out of this, Quercus Alba.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were the one who said it yourself, that the name of the move was... ..."Early Summer Rain Jab". But that name was only decided upon right before the show was about to start.
</line><line>Alba:
So? Just what are you driving at?
</line><line>Lang:
That the name of the move you told us was never used in the show or said aloud!
</line><line>Alba:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, would you care to tell us about how you found out the name of that move?
</line><line>Lang:
Because I can only think of one way you could've known...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! This is the only way you could've known the name of the special move!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
You knew the name because you saw it! You saw it on the dressing room's white board!
</line><line>Alba:
............!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The staff members who knew were keeping it a secret. So you couldn't have simply gone up to a staff member and asked. Which means that the only other option left is that you saw it on the white board.
</line><line>Kay:
So, that means that Mr. Alba was in the waiting room at some point, right?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But what's the big deal, sir? I don't see what that means!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is another piece of evidence that has a great deal to do with the <textEffects>dressing room</textEffects>. So we can't afford to let this slide! <textEffects>This is related to both the dressing room and to Mr. Coachen's murder!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The pushcart that was used to move the body was right there in the dressing room! During the show, the pushcart awaited its turn to be pushed on-stage in the dressing room. And it was finally pushed there, along with the Iron Infant, in the last scene of the show. And then, right after the show ended, it went into Allebahst along with the Steel Samurai. Which means that the only time the killer could've placed the body inside the pushcart was... ...when the pushcart was in the dressing room backstage!
</line><line>Kay:
So basically, the killer has to be someone who visited the dressing room during the show!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely.
</line><line>Alba:
.........Gnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! But wait! What if, and this is just a "what if"...! What if the murder didn't take place in the dressing room?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, Kay!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have to admit, she brings up a valid possibility. During the show, the dressing room was supposed to be devoid of people.
</line><line>Lang:
Anyone going into the private dressing room would stand out like a sore thumb!
</line><line>Franziska:
But despite that, the killer still managed to move the body with the pushcart.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Correct, and it is because of the set-up of the theater's dressing room... ...that it would be the ideal location for the murder of Manny Coachen!
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! During the show, you went down to the dressing room. And I want to know why!
</line><line>Alba:
..................Yes. .........Yes, I was there. I went into... the dressing room.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I knew it! I'm placing you under arrest right now, pal! You got that!? ARREST!
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Alba:
Not so fast.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What is it now!?
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. Don't I deserve a chance to explain myself?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Explain? What is there to explain!?
</line><line>Alba:
I believe I told you earlier that I went to the bathroom. Well, I got lost when I did. I wanted to ask for directions but when I opened the dressing room door, no one was inside. And that's when I saw the name of the move on the white board.
</line><line>Lang:
You punk! Still trying to get out of this...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Do you really think you can get away at this point...!?
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't there anything you can do to stop him!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nngh...! I don't have enough evidence on hand to do anything! I don't have the airtight evidence I need to put this man away for good. But if that's what I need, then perhaps...)</textEffects> Agent Lang! I believe an investigation of the dressing room in question is in order. It's possible that we may find new evidence there!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah! If Mr. Edgeworth pokes around in there, I'm sure he'll find some new facts, pal!
</line><line>Kay:
Ooh! And if we use Little Thief, we may even learn something from a re-creation!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
...We don't need to do any of that.
</line><line>Kay:
What!? Wolfy!? How could you!?
</line><line>Lang:
I'm not saying this to be mean. It's just that... we've already searched there. My men really are something else.
</line><line>Franziska:
And they found nothing?
</line><line>Lang:
There's only one thing I can say to you, sis, and it's that they found nothing. That's it.
</line><line>Franziska:
I... guess you're right. If they had found something, they would've reported it to us.
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh heh. They couldn't find anything because there was nothing there to find.
</line><line>Kay:
And if there is no info to feed into Little Thief, then I can't do much to help either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is this the end? The murder took place in this theater, which is not protected under extraterritorial rights... ...and the fact that it was Mr. Alba himself who committed the murder... If I can't prove both statements to be true, Mr. Alba walks away a free man! Is there no other course of action left to us...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
It would appear that your hand of cards has turned out to be a bust. Now if you will excuse me. Because of you people, I missed my flight. Now I must make haste to arrange for a new one...

</line><line>Kay:
Wh-Who is it this time?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Hold it right there, you whippersnappers!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ack! First Larry, and now YOU!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What is with that scary, mobster-like scowl on your face, Edgey-poo!? Don't treat me like I'm some sort of nuisance! I've been meaning to say this, but all of you keep talking about things I don't get at all! You're all leaving this lady in the sad, depressing, lonely dust that I'm about to cry in!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why did you have to speak up right at this instant...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Oldbag:
But you know what, Edgey-poo!? Cheer up! Because I'm about to give you the most wonderful thing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
? The most "wonderful thing"...? From you...?
</line><line>Oldbag:
It's so super <textEffects>special</textEffects> that I couldn't give it away to just anyone, you know! Ah, my special present of love to my sweet Edgey-poo... Are you ready!? ...Is this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-It's...!
</line><line>Kay:
.........
</line><line>Lang:
.........
</line><line>Franziska:
.........
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's... a box of those "Samurai Dogs", right?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Yes! Oh, Edgey-poo! Here, go on and eat one and you'll feel as right as rain.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Kay:
.........
</line><line>Lang:
.........
</line><line>Franziska:
.........
</line><line>Gumshoe:
.........
</line><line>Alba:
Are we through here?
</line><line>Oldbag:
...Why did everyone get so quiet all of a sudden!? Edgey-poooooooo! Tell me YOU understand the depths of this lady's love for you!!! I'm not one to hand out snacks willy-nilly, you know! No sir! The thought occurred to me that maybe it would be good if I fed you and made sure you were nice and full! One day, it's my dream to serve you some of my own home-made food! I mean, isn't it the desire of every woman to make sure that their beloved never goes hungry? And that's what I wanted to experience! I'll tell you one thing, though. A long time ago, they used to say that I could make the most delicious meal out of any ingredient you threw in front of me! Oh, I was a star in the kitchen back then, and I was
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do anything about her!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There is no power on Earth that can force THAT woman into silence!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Oldbag:
But I'm so sick and tired of it! All you people do is look down on me! Even this box of "Samurai Dogs" played me for a fool! It had a special design on its fan, like the <textEffects>Japanese flag</textEffects>, so I thought it was special! But when I ate one, it tasted just like all the rest! Ooh, it made me so mad!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wait, a special box with a <span style="color:#E16935">Hinomaru</textEffects>-like fan on it? I've never heard of such a piece of merchandise existing before. However, there it is The <textEffects>red rising sun</textEffects> on this fan is filled in... I-Is it possible!? Could it be...!?)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
After the show, the Samurai Dogs were piled up on the dressing room floor. However, there is no such thing as a "<textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Rising Sun Dogs - Taken from the dressing room, the fan&#39;s rising sun is filled in for some reason.">Rising Sun Dog</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Rising Sun Dogs - Taken from the dressing room, the fan's rising sun is filled in for some reason.)</textEffects></span>". This contradiction of facts between something that should not exist, and yet does... The rays from this rising sun may be just what we needed to point us in the right direction!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
A present...?
</line><line>Larry:
The studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them "hi". I had to <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Samurai Dogs - Boxes of Samurai Dogs were sitting in the pushcart.">pile them all into the pushcart just to move them</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Samurai Dogs - Boxes of Samurai Dogs were sitting in the pushcart.)</textEffects></span> all!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I believe you understand what this means, correct? <textEffects>You killed Mr. Coachen</textEffects> at this theater, <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Body in the pushcart - The killer placed Coachen&#39;s body in the pushcart in the dressing room.">and then placed his body inside the pushcart</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Body in the pushcart - The killer placed Coachen's body in the pushcart in the dressing room.)</textEffects></span>. And then... ...you forced to Steel Samurai to unwittingly move the body for you!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It's time to piece the final pieces of this logic puzzle together. No matter how fragile or small the connections may be... ...once we've found them all, the way to the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> will be revealed!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The killer used the pushcart to transport the body... ...which means that they had to remove the <span style="color:#E16935">Samurai Dogs</textEffects> from within first! Therefore, the <textEffects>Samurai Dogs</textEffects> that were piled up on the dressing room floor... ...were most likely <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Samurai Dogs were removed - Dogs were put on dressing room floor by the killer to make room for the body.">taken out of the pushcart</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Samurai Dogs were removed - Dogs were put on dressing room floor by the killer to make room for the body.)</textEffects></span> by the killer!)</span>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That which should not exist, this box of Samurai Dogs with a <span style="color:#E16935">hinomaru</textEffects> on it... If this red rising sun... ...was filled in when the killer was busy removing Dogs from the pushcart... ...then it's proof that the murder took place in the dressing room. As long as this red substance turns out to be what I believe it to be!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Wendy Oldbag. I thank you.
</line><line>Oldbag:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What you have given to me is truly something very "<textEffects>special</textEffects>".
</line><line>Oldbag:
E-Edgey-poooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth? Are you sure you're feeling OK, sir!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba. As I suspected, you killed Mr. Coachen in the dressing room.
</line><line>Alba:
How many times must I listen to you repeat yourself? Haven't you figured it out yet? You words are meaningless, worthless, and powerless. The only way I'm going to continue to cooperate with some definitive evidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. That arrogance, that self-confidence... You believe that you've erased every piece of evidence that could incriminate you. However! There remains one piece here, and it is what will put you away for good!
</line><line>Alba:
Hah! You're bluffing!
</line><line>Lang:
Oho... Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Sounds like you finally found them. You finally found the fangs we need to go after this guy's jugular! So tell us, what about that box of Samurai Dogs is going to put the old man away!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The trace evidence that will bring him down? Why, it's here of course!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The box of <textEffects>Samurai Dogs</textEffects> with a rising sun fan on it... This should never have existed. So I want you all to take a good look at this red spot. It's a single <textEffects>drop of blood</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!?
</line><line>Lang:
What!?
</line><line>Alba:
Blood, you say...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, I'd like this blood analyzed posthaste.
</line><line>Lang:
I've got to admit, I'm a bit surprised! I can't believe we found <textEffects>blood</textEffects> in a place like this! Hey, you! Get this down to the lab, pronto!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
But why was there blood on that box to begin with?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we think about the flow of the crime, I think the reason will become obvious. Larry, you said that you transported the "Samurai Dogs" with the pushcart, correct?
</line><line>Larry:
Oh, umm, yeah! You have a great memory, Edgey! That pushcart was a bit too big for my son, you know what I mean? So to make sure everyone could see him, I had to pile some stuff in. I figured the Samurai Dogs were there, so I used them to fill up the cart.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If what Larry says is true, then what were the boxes doing on the floor?
</line><line>Lang:
Ah, I see. The killer took them out in order to place the body in the pushcart!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. And that is when I believe the victim's blood found its way onto that box.
</line><line>Lang:
But when my men investigated that room, not a single box of Samurai Dogs was in there... ...because embassy staff members had already confiscated them.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. No doubt to hide the evidence of the murder.
</line><line>Kay:
It's a good thing Ms. Oldbag <textEffects>managed to steal</textEffects> that one box before they got to them, huh? Looks like Ms. Oldbag also managed to put this Great Thief to shame!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What a scandalous way to putting that! I didn't "steal"; I received it from myself!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba, I'd say this was one very fatal oversight on your part.
</line><line>Alba:

Heh heh heh heh. Sorry to rain on your little love-fest, however...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How... How can he be so self-confident in a no-win situation for him like this?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alba:
Even if that blood turns out to belong to Mr. Coachen, then what?
</line><line>Kay:
Heh! So, Mr. Edgeworth! It sounds like he's not ready to call it quits yet, huh!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The sole piece of evidence that was left at the scene of the crime... That alone has shed light on a new fact. At the very least, we now have proof that the murder occurred in the dressing room.
</line><line>Alba:
.........And? You say that like it means something.
</line><line>Kay:
...Huh?

Sir! The analysis came back and confirmed that the red substance is blood.

Mr. Edgeworth, I wonder if you might humor my question?

Your question?

The one from before, or have you forgotten? Even if that is Mr. Coachen's blood, what difference would it make?

But it doesn't prove that I am your killer, does it?
</line><line>Lang:
Gnnnrk! That's... That's...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nngh...! He has a very good point. The blood on that box doesn't prove that Mr. Alba is the killer...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Th-Then... this evidence... It's meaningless...!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That can't be... We were so close, sir!
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

I wanna smack that smug look off his face! Come on, there's gotta be something we can do!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(We finally found a solid piece of evidence! There must be something I can expose with it!)</textEffects> .............................. <textEffects>(A-Ack! I can't think of a single thing...!)</textEffects>

Who was that!? It's too late. I won't allow anyone to stop me now!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-It wasn't me, pal!
</line><line>Larry:
And it wasn't me this time, either!
</line><line>Oldbag:
It wasn't me either!
</line><line>???:
I-It was meeeeee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why did you--!?
</line><line>Forensics:
Umm... Because I haven't finished reporting everything to you yet, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's more...?
</line><line>Lang:
What!? Hurry up and spit it out!
</line><line>Forensics:
Y-Y-Yes, siiir! Th-That blood I mentioned... It's not of the same blood type as the victim's blood!
</line><line>Lang:
Wh--!?
</line><line>Kay:
No--!
</line><line>Alba:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Lang:
What do you mean it's "not the same type"!? You mean it's not the victim's blood!? If it isn't his... then who the hell's is it!?
</line><line>Forensics:
I-I don't know, siiiiiiiiiir! All I know is that it's not the same blood type as the victim's, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
What should we do now, Mr. Edgeworth!? I have no idea what's what anymore!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........Neither do I.
</line><line>Alba:
Heheheheheheheh. My, what an amusing turn of events!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Alba:
That blood drop proved something to be true alright -- namely, my words.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And which one of your words would that be?
</line><line>Alba:
The ones where I said that your words are meaningless, worthless, and powerless. That blood has nothing to do with the murder investigation whatsoever! Need I remind you that the blood got onto that box long before it entered my embassy?
</line><line>Kay:
Wh-What sort of nonsense--!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah! It's BLOOD, pal! There's no way it's not related to the murder!
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh. So you would like to believe. But what if someone preparing the Samurai Dogs had a small nosebleed? What then?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Gnrk! I-I guess that's possible...
</line><line>Lang:
Damn it! Have we been wasting our time on a red herring?
</line><line>Alba:
The blood doesn't belong to anyone connected to the case. That should be clue enough.
</line><line>Lang:
Quercus Alba! You BASTARD!
</line><line>Alba:
Silence! Don't you ever address me with such a filthy word again. I've wasted enough time here with you, and you have your answers. Now, let me through.

</line><line>Lang:
Alba! It doesn't matter where you run off to, you'll never escape me! Someday, I'll have the satisfaction of sinking my fangs into you. You'll see! And all of Interpol will be behind me, working to see to it that that day comes!
</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. Do you know what your words sound like to me? They sound like the whinings of a pathetic loser of a mutt.
</line><line>Lang:
Arroooooooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is this really the extent of all that we can do? Is the blood really from someone completely unrelated to the case? Or is there another possibility? Someone else other than the victim?

What would he who can turn any desperate situation around do...? .........<span style="color:#E16935">Turn it around</textEffects>...? That's it! I must turn my way of thinking around! It's not, "<textEffects>Whose blood is this?</textEffects>" It's, "<textEffects>Whose blood could get onto the box like this?</textEffects>" And if I think about it that way...! If the blood got onto the box when the body was being placed into the pushcart... ...then the owner of said blood must have been in the <textEffects>dressing room</textEffects> at the time! And there is only one person that could be!)</span>
</line><line>Alba:
Well, I must praise you for trying so hard. It's because of you kids that I was removed from center stage. ...and will be forced to live out the rest of my life in the shadows, unfortunately. But it's not a total loss, as the underworld will allow me more freedom than you'll ever know. Freedom like what the raven feels as it flies through the dark night sky. You can't lay a finger on me, not now or ever. The arm of the law is powerless before me!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph......... "Powerless", is it? I wouldn't be so sure about that if I were you.
</line><line>Alba:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to describe you in one word: pitiful.
</line><line>Alba:
Pitiful...? How so?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! Your wings were clipped long ago.
</line><line>Alba:
.........!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And for someone who is trying to fly away on them without noticing that fact... ..."pitiful" is the perfect word to describe you!
</line><line>Alba:
Hah! Mere words!
</line><line>Kay:
What do you mean by "his wings are clipped", Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just what you think it means, Kay. We had already caught him in our trap a while back. With an incredibly powerful, definitive piece of evidence!
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, hey! Earth to Mr. Prosecutor! Care to speak in English!? What are you talking about? What piece of evidence?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The piece I speak of is of course... this drop of blood.
</line><line>Franziska:
But we know that it's not from the victim! I don't see how it remains relevant to the case at all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. von Karma... I believe that is exactly why it's very important to the case. And the part that is the most important is the fact that it's not the victim's blood!
</line><line>Alba:
............!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're looking a little pale. Good, then I believe you are already aware of what I mean.
</line><line>Lang:
Then, you know who the blood belongs to!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Of course I do. This piece of evidence is the <textEffects>irrefutable proof</textEffects> that will stop the killer in his tracks. <textEffects>The blood that soiled this box of Samurai Dogs belongs to this person!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The blood of the rising sun on this box belongs to you, Quercus Alba!
</line><line>Alba:
Grrr!
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh--?
</line><line>Lang:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Kay:
Why is HIS blood on the box of Samurai Dogs!? He's not even a victim!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The blood fell onto the box when Mr. Coachen's body was being loaded into the pushcart. At that time, the only two people in the dressing room were the victim and his killer.
</line><line>Lang:
So that's what you mean! If the blood doesn't belong to the victim...
</line><line>Franziska:
...Then there is only one other person it could belong to!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, and that person is the murderer himself. That's the only logical conclusion.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But Mr. Coachen was the one who was stabbed, sir! Why would Mr. Alba have been the one who was bleeding?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What if during the murder, Mr. Coachen had fought back?
</line><line>Franziska:
You mean, if before Mr. Alba could kill him, Mr. Coachen managed to wound Mr. Alba...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, and I believe we have a piece of evidence that proves that he was bleeding then! <textEffects>(What is the piece of evidence that shows that Mr. Alba was probably bleeding at the time?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba, you bear on your body a great wound.
</line><line>Alba:
That was from when DeMasque II attacked me with a pair of scissors...
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, and that happened way after he was in the dressing room...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, but is that what really happened? You can manufacture a weapon by smearing blood on it, so I can't just accept that as fact. Shall we try a test, Mr. Alba, and see if the shape of your wound matches the scissors?
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Alba:
You really are something else, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't let a single thing slip you by, no matter how insignificant the possibility.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. You're one to talk Mr. Alba. You've managed to give the law the slip for ten years as the smuggling ring's leader. No matter the danger, you can hide every last ounce of fear and anxiety from everyone. You truly are a one-of-a-kind criminal.
</line><line>Alba:

</line><line>Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. I am the master of my fear. However, to think that a person such as you... ...could miss such a large thing...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You believe I've overlooked something?
</line><line>Alba:
You said that my wound was caused by Mr. Coachen. And that it was caused here in one of the theater's dressing rooms, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, that is correct.
</line><line>Alba:
I'd like to point out... that it's simply not possible. My wound is a stab wound, and one that could only have come from a blade. I wonder where you will propose that such a weapon came from?
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! This theater was packed with security guards...
</line><line>Franziska:
It would've been impossible for anyone to come into this area with a weapon of any sort!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Just as Mr. Alba was able to bring in the Allebahstian knife in a bouquet... ...there must have been some other way to sneak in a weapon of some sort!
</line><line>Alba:
Ah, but as long as you can't prove what that other way is... ...all your talk about Mr. Coachen stabbing me is pure nonsense. So if that other way does exist, you'd better hurry and tell me now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........With pleasure.
</line><line>Alba:
Wait, what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence shows us how Mr. Coachen brought a weapon into this theater!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Among law enforcement, this piece is known as the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects>.
</line><line>Alba:
Th-That key...!
</line><line>Kay:
That's the key that my father stole from here seven years ago...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And it is very unique, in that it is both a key and a knife. Meaning that under the guise of a key, it could've been easily brought into the theater!
</line><line>Alba:
...Gnnrooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You couldn't dispose of the knife that stabbed you... ...therefore, you wiped off the blood, and placed it back in Mr. Coachen's pocket! After all, the key itself opens the safe in his office. And inside that safe, there was <textEffects>a document about Cohdopian paper</textEffects>, signed by Mr. Coachen. In order to make it look like Mr. Coachen died as the leader of the smuggling ring... ...you had to make it so that the police were the ones who opened that office safe! Hmph. All that hard work to save yourself only served to destroy you in the end. Shall we try matching this knife's blade with your wound, Mr. Quercus Alba? ...And that is what some may call, the coup de grâce.
</line><line>Alba:
............I-Impossible... You... You can't take me down! Swine! All of you! Especially Manny Coachen!!! This is all because of that man's betrayal! He sought to steal control of the smuggling ring from me by removing me as ambassador! Which is why he deserved to die while bearing the guilt for all of my crimes for me! That's why I sent out the Yatagarasu's card, and how this incident was born! Manny was supposed to be the smuggling ring's leader who was killed by the Yatagarasu! But! I had... yet another reason, yet another story that was supposed to play out! Manny's death was supposed to bring everything to a close! And I would've gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling prosecutors!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba, I'm afraid there is one more question I forgot to ask.........
</line><line>Alba:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This country's, or Allebahst's: which country's court would you like to face first? Either way, it's game over for you.
</line><line>Alba:

<line>Gumshoe:
Whew! This is it, the big day! It's Mr. Alba's trial today!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And next week, he's scheduled to stand trial in his own country of Allebahst. Franziska is heading that one. I suspect she'll be serving a full course of whip lashes at it.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Having to face Ms. von Karma in court right after facing you, sir... *shudder* I don't even WANT to think of what that would be like. I caught a glimpse of Mr. Alba as he was being escorted into the courthouse... ...and boy, he looked about as glum as I do the day before I get my monthly paycheck! You know, I've been thinking... ...that flight attendant, and even Mr. Portsman were all Mr. Alba's secret agents.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Correct. That smuggling ring was the common thread between all of the incidents. Cammy Meele was to provide support during smuggling ops, using her job as an attendant. And Mr. Portsman was to manipulate trials related to the ring to end in their favor.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oorrgh... iFly Airlines, and even the Prosecutor's Office... No one was safe from the smuggling ring, huh, sir!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suspect there are even more members of this ring spread throughout the world.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... It sounds like such a big op that I can't even begin to imagine what it's like! ..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? What is it, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah! Nothing! It's just... Well, come to think of it... ...Mr. Ernest Amano's trial is also scheduled for later today, sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm aware of that... Mr. Amano has been working with the smuggling ring now for over ten years. He used the Amano Group's various connections world-wide to assist the ring. But all of that has come to an end as his conglomerate is now undergoing harsh scrutiny. I owe Mr. Amano a debt of gratitude, but he must pay his debt to society.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Well, with the arrests of both Mr. Alba and Mr. Amano... ...I guess that about wraps up the KG-8 Incident as well, huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose so. The real killer in the KG-8 Incident ten years ago was Manny Coachen. And seven years ago, the killer in the second KG-8 Incident was Mack Rell. Those two facts are the unshakable truth, however... ...it seems that a lot of effort was put into hiding these and other truths from us. And I will expose it all at the trials today.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You're solving cases left and right today, aren't you, sir!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Cece Yew and Deid Mann... Perhaps now, these two brave souls who tried to make the truth known can rest in peace.)</textEffects> ...By the way, I received some gifts from Ambassador Palaeno. Shrimp, crab, beef... I don't need any of these, so I'm giving them to you.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What!? Seriously, sir!? W-Wait... Actually, I don't think I want them anymore... The way you're holding them... Don't tell me they're just coupons, sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, have you not read the paper recently? Ever since the two countries became Cohdopia again, its economy has changed.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Really?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And it seems that Ambassador Palaeno has reaped a few benefits of his own from it. He has been announced as the official ambassador of the newly re-unified Cohdopia.
</line><line>???:
Ah, but what a pity... Even though every item he sent is a "treasure", you don't seem all that interested. Well, if you don't want them... I can give them to my lovely assistant, Kay!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
W-Wait! That's not what I said! So, umm, Mr. Edgeworth! Please let me have them, sir! Actually, come to think of it, where is Kay? How come she's still not here?
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! You've gotta be more alert than that!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eek!
</line><line>Kay:
I can't believe you didn't notice I was even mimicking Mr. Edgeworth's voice for a bit!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I totally didn't notice you, or realize that voice was you!

<line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Ferocious love blooms with each new Spring."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... A pleasant surprise to see you here.
</line><line>Lang:
It's been a long time since I set foot in a courthouse. But I wasn't going to miss... ...watching the guy who screwed up my country finally get what's coming to him. Well, that and something else. I want to see you in action in court.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is that so, Agent Lang?
</line><line>Lang:
We flushed out all of the counterfeit bills, so Zheng Fa is finally at peace again. And it's all thanks to you, so I just want to say... thanks.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow, I never thought I'd see the day ol' Wolfy says thanks to Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I should be the one thanking you, Agent Lang. If you hadn't negated Mr. Alba's extraterritorial rights... ...I would not have been able to bring him to trial. I believe the victory belongs to the both of us in this case.
</line><line>Lang:
..................Tch. A shared victory, huh? Look, don't get me wrong; I'll still never forgive you prosecutors... ...and I have zero interest in that "<textEffects>truth</textEffects>" thing you talk about in court. I've always done things my own way, and that's not about to change, you got that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph, I see... Well, I believe you should follow your own creed when you do your job.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, and if there's ever someone your precious "truth" can't catch... ...feel free to sit around and cry about it all you want. But as for me, I'm going to get that person no matter what!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Alright. It's about time for the trial to start. I will see you later.
</line><line>Lang:
I'll be watching your performance from the gallery. I'm looking forward to this.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I prepared a whole ton of ticker tape for today's victory, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
I'll help throw some around when Mr. Edgeworth wins!
</line><line>Lang:
Ha ha ha. Hope you've get enough, because I'm going to go call my men up as well!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...A modest amount of ticker tape goes a long way!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
The scene shifts to the courtroom, and the final act of this long tale begins. "The Legend of the Great Thief Yatagarasu". It's the story of those who chose to dedicate their lives to the pursuit of the truth. "Prosecutors are those who seek a guilty verdict for the defendants they meet... ...and to that end, you have no choice but to win by any means necessary." That creed was forced on me since I was very young... ...however, I no longer think that is all we prosecutors are. And that is because...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even though I've only been away from the courtroom for a short time... ...I feel as though... it's been a lifetime since I've set foot in one. And today, more than any other day, I feel the fight within me rising...)</textEffects>

<line>Teneiro:
I am really in Mr. Edgeworth's debt for the other day! Thanks to him, I'm still free to serve in the friendly blue skies. Oh, so about my suitcases... ...I've been selling them on the internet, and they've become a real sensation! Thanks to the praise the art world has lavished on my work as being truly post-modern... ...the airline has chosen me to design their new line of iFly jumbo jets! Just think! Someday, you will be able to take a ride in my pink-walled, yellow-seated jet!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lablanc:
Edgeworth? Ah, that rudeness of a rude man! Hmph! Because of him, my time and money is wasted. But more importantlier! I received a most fantastic treasure mostly! The Primidux Statue of the Principality of Cohdopia! It weights a bit light in my hands, but the Ambassador Palaeno was most generous.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
We finally caught Agent Hicks's killer, and I was able to witness Mr. Alba's teary eyes. It feels good to finally bring everything to a close. I received another offer from Interpol to work another case in cooperation with them... ...however, the Cohdopian courts await. Cohdopia's air is supposed to be very fresh, so my whip should find new vigor there.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Meekins:
This little patrolman has been fired as of today, sir! I thought I was safe since we found the gun I had dropped... ...but I hadn't noticed that I had dropped my police badge, too! I guess what really broke the camel's back was that I couldn't find my badge. My little life has suddenly tripped into a dark, black hole, sir! I think I'll go the courthouse and file a complaint with Ruffles Man!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
I was actually hoping to talk with Mr. Edgeworth a bit more than I did... But I've got to get going and return to Europe. I've still got a long way to go and a lot of stuff to study there! Next time I help Mr. Edgeworth on a case, I'm going to do it as a real forensic scientist! I'm sure he's going to need all the help I can give him, scientifically!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Paups:
Because the kidnapping was staged, I was let off easy... ...but I won't be going outside much any time soon, but that's... really OK. The only prison I'm forever trapped in is the cage of love. The guard down at the detention center... well, when he's on guard duty... ...he has such a cold look in his eyes, just like that prosecutor... *ba-dump* Ah! Stop it, Lauren! When will you ever learn to stop being a prisoner of love...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It appears there are all sorts of drama that takes place outside of the courtroom. Since we judges are here day in and day out, I've only heard a few rumors, but... ...apparently, Mr. Edgeworth teamed up with a thief, and became a detective. Maybe I should team up with a bailiff and try to become a lawyer or something...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Byrde:
Whew! I barely escaped death yet again!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, but boy were we lucky to have Mr. Edgeworth help us out, huh!?
</line><line>Byrde:
Yeah... but because I lost the key, I got fired from my security guard job.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't let it get you down, Maggey! You've still got me!
</line><line>Byrde:
You're right, sir! I won't be sad! I'm going to pick myself up and get through this! I wonder what my next job should be...? Ooh, this is actually kind of fun!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Palaeno:
Why not come to Cohdopia for your Summer vacation!? We have coupons aplenty! Right now, our embassy is proud to present our "Let's Investigate a Murder!" show. Although, recreating that particular case has created a few small fires of its own. Then we had a few problems with the fire marshals... but the next event will be great! It will be an attraction entitled, "Capture the Yatagarasu!" Of course, I hope to enlist Kay's help in creating our latest attraction!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Larry:
I can't believe that Mindy ditched me and went to Japan... But it's OK! Because that's how I met Miharu! We're planning to go to Paris soon, and start a business! We're going to sell "Blue Ocean Dogs"! They'll sell like hot-cake hot dogs for sure! A blue hot dog in a blue bun, I guarantee it'll turn your tongue, and your face blue! I know I'm not really the type to work a lot, or at all really, but... Oh, so I noticed that I really haven't seen the guy in the blue suit at all recently. I wonder what's up? Well, the next time we meet, I'm gonna make him eat one of my Dogs!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
Today I gave testimony in court today... as a member of the Yatagarasu...
</line><line>Lang:
Yo, Mr. Badd! You look well, all things considered. By the way, have you noticed that elements within the ring have begun moving?
</line><line>Badd:
They're probably fighting over who should succeed... over who should be the next boss... .........Although, to be honest, I wish I could forget I'd ever heard of that smuggling ring.
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Thoroughly bite the poisonous snake from head to tail!" No one runs afoul of the law and escapes this wolf's fangs! I'll get you all yet!
</line><line>Badd:
.........Ah, youth. When did I become so old, I wonder...? I've begun noticing the gray hairs in my beard more. I'm thinking of retiring my mirror...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Oldbag:
I was the Pink Princess and the Pink Badger, all in the span of two days! Talk about busy! But it's alright, because I got a letter from my beloved Edgey-poo. "Please take care of your hip, and when you wish to speak, first take off your headpiece." ...What does he mean by that last statement!? It's not like I enjoy being under a head piece every time I see him! I've been an alien, and then some creepy, fuzzy, pink animal, and then I was the Pink Princess, a great hero of justice! But ever since I was a young maiden, I could be spotted wearing the most stylish hat on my head, although right around now, maybe it'd be more preferable to wear my own costume or something, but even that just sounds like a terrible idea...

<line>Gumshoe:
Whooooop! I feel so much better now that the trial's over! And as always, your legal prowess was top-notch, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, and nothing beat the look on Mr. Alba's face when you revealed the ring's secrets! I was amazed! You're like a totally different person when you step into a courtroom!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is always ten times fiercer in court!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Based on the information Mr. Alba offered up, they've begun large scale operations... ...to clean up the rest of the ring, which I'm happy to leave to Franziska and Agent Lang.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
So, what are your plans now, Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
Hm? Oh, well, we've taken care of the creep who killed my father, so I'm not sure... Hey! I know! Maybe I'll just keep on being Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Are you still trying to steal my job, pal!?
</line><line>Kay:
Just kidding, just kidding! I can't steal something so important to you, Gummy!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Phew, what a relief!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
Yes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even after all that's happened, are you still planning to become a Great Thief?
</line><line>Kay:
Of course! But I don't want to tarnish the legend of the noble Yatagarasu... ...so I'm going to hold off on doing anything until I make a tight 3-person team of my own!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A three-person team...?
</line><line>Kay:
A three-person team of young beauties the same age as me, if possible!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...With those criteria, I highly doubt you'll find the two other people you need.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
My father chose to fight for the truth. I think that's what was so noble about him. So you see, Mr. Edgeworth... ...the only things I will ever steal... are the truths that have been hidden away. I'm going to work extra hard to make a world where the Yatagarasu isn't needed!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Let's both strive for such a future.
</line><line>Kay:
Well, I guess it's time for me to get going.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay! Keep your chin up and stay strong, OK!? And don't be a stranger!
</line><line>Kay:
Don't be worry! I'll be back! I'll be sure to break the lock on the window and sneak in!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you could, I'd appreciate it if you came in through the building's front door...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's OK, Mr. Edgeworth! The lock on my window at home has been broken for forever!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! One last thing before I go! Let's take a group picture, just the three of us!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, a commemorative photo! Every big case has to end with one!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..................No.
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! Why not!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't tell me you're camera shy, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
O-Of course not, Detective!
</line><line>Kay:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm taking the picture now! Hey! Come back here!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You can't run away from this, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ack! Hey! Detective Gumshoe! S-Stop that! I can't be seen doing... that!
</line><line>Kay:
OK! I'm totally taking it now! Say, "cheeeeeeeeeese!"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
And thus, the long tale of the KG-8 Incident came to a close. It saw the demise of a smuggling ring and the birth of a little Great Thief. But there is little time to rest and relax... ...for I am eager to tackle the investigation into a new case. The reason for my eagerness is... ...my want to pursue the truth, and... ...my want to believe in the strength of those who use the power of the law for good. As someone who has chosen to live my life as a prosecutor... ...that is my new creed.
