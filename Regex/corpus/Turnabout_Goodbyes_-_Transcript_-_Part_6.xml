I'd call what you did "running away," and not "just leaving." You heard Larry's testimony, and realized you were in danger!

</line><line>Karma:
Now, Mr. Wright, there's no need to rush to conclusions. As I said, the witness was not "running away." Listen to the testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He sure seems relaxed! In fact, they both do--von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)</textEffects>

<line>Uncle:
<textEffects>But, I wasn't running away or nothing.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Uncle:
<textEffects>I, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Uncle:
<textEffects>I figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Uncle:
<textEffects>Er... I mean, I'd need one of those "motive" things, right? And I don't got one.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(First things first, I have to prove this man is who he is! Do that and the motive will prove itself!)</textEffects>

<line>(<i>Pressing fourth and fifth statements leads to:</i>)
</line><line>Judge:
Might I say something, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
You've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has "nothing to do with this case" and "no motive"... Both of these statements are <textEffects>lies</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor!
</line><line>Karma:
Ho hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Don't play dumb von Karma!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!
</line><line>Judge:
... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But, what does this mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Karma:
This is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's <span style="color:#E16935">Yogi</textEffects> right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects>! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...
</line><line>Judge:
I see... that makes sense.
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-why?
</line><line>Karma:
The witness... has <textEffects>no fingerprints</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? What!? No fingerprints!?
</line><line>Uncle:
Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!? <textEffects>(Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh...
</line><line>Karma:
Hmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
There is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! What are we going to do!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... <textEffects>(What do I do!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright? Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine the parrot for a little comic relief, hmm?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... "Cross-examine <span style="color:#E16935">the parrot</textEffects>"?)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!
</line><line>Judge:
Take Mr. von Karma up?
</line><line>Karma:
On his... proposal?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!
</line><line>Judge:
O-order! Order! Uh... well, what do you think, Mr. von Karma?
</line><line>Karma:
Need you even ask!? This is a farce! I object!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!
</line><line>Karma:
Mmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest.
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Karma:
Of course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick... this is crazy!
</line><line>Karma:
Well? Still want to go through with your little game!?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
That's... quite a bird. Please tell us your name?

</line><line>Judge:
Name!
</line><line>Parrot:
<textEffects>"..."</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The witness is ignoring me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. Very well, witness... Who is your owner? Please, er... testify for us.

<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Certainly the most concise testimony we've had so far. Very well, begin your cross-examination.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right...
</line><line>Maya:
What are you going to do, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?

<line>Phoenix:
Yes it does!
</line><line>Judge:!!!
</line><line>Karma:
Hah! Fascinating! You claim that the parrot's name will prove her owner's identity? Then show us this proof!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Listen. We've not here to answer the question of "<textEffects>who is the caretaker</textEffects>." We're here to prove that <textEffects>he is Yanni Yogi</textEffects>! All we have to do is tie the name "<textEffects>Polly</textEffects>" to <textEffects>Yogi</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is...

<line>Judge:
<textEffects>The DL-6</textEffects> Case File?

</line><line>Karma:
That's quite a large file you have there! Which page is this "proof" on, then? Show us, or stop wasting our time!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, please show us the page. Where in this file is the information connected to this parrot's name?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It's on the "Suspect Data" page!
</line><line>Judge:
...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This page has all the information about Yanni Yogi! Right after he was arrested, his fiancee committed suicide, see?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, it does say that, yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What was his fiancee's name?
</line><line>Judge:
"Polly Jenkins"... "<textEffects>Polly</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! He remembered the name of his fiancee who committed suicide. That's why he named his parrot after her!
</line><line>Judge:
I see! I guess that is possible.
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
Bah! A mere coincidence, that's all! My granddaughter has a dog she calls "<textEffects>Phoenix</textEffects>." Well, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Does this make you my granddaughter's fiancee!? She's only seven years old!!!
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
Actually it does! That's why I had her say it!
</line><line>Karma:
Hah! Ridiculous! How can the number to a safe tell us who the caretaker is? Show us your proof! What could possibly link this number to the caretaker's true identity!?
</line>


<line>Karma:
<textEffects>The DL-6 Case</textEffects> File? What is this obsession you have with that case?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Where in this file is something relating to the safe number?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It's on the "Case Summary" page!
</line><line>Judge:
The Case... Summary?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Specifically, <textEffects>the date</textEffects> on which the DL-6 Incident occurred!
</line><line>Judge:
The date of the incident? <textEffects>December 28</textEffects>...? Why, that's <textEffects>today's date</textEffects>. Fifteen years ago!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And the number on that safe is <textEffects>1228</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
He used the date of <textEffects>the DL-6 Incident</textEffects> as the number for his safe, Your Honor! That's how important that date was to him!
</line><line>Judge:
I see... it certainly is an interesting coincidence. People often do set their secret numbers to dates.
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
Bah! This is not tangible proof! I set my ATM card's number to "<textEffects>0001</textEffects>" because I'm number one! This has nothing to do with a date! Nothing!

W-well... I guess we should try to get some information out of her! We need to show the judge that her owner is <textEffects>Mr. Yogi</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
That's enough! I think we've reached a conclusion here.
</line><line>Karma:
This is a mere coincidence, that's all!
</line><line>Judge:
True, that is a possibility. However, two coincidences at the same time seems more like a "<textEffects>pattern</textEffects>" to me.
</line><line>Karma:
Wh... what are you saying!?

Summon the caretaker of the boat shop. Immediately!

Wait! This witness, he doesn't remember...
</line><line>Uncle:
No... it's okay.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Uncle:
I've accomplished what I wanted to do. I'm done.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! He looks totally different!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!
</line><line>Judge:
W-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!
</line><line>Yogi:
My name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?
</line><line>Yogi:
... Yes.  It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancee, my social standing... ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan to take my <textEffects>revenge</textEffects> on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.
</line><line>Judge:
W-wait a moment! <textEffects>Revenge</textEffects>... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?
</line><line>Yogi:
I'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
von Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?
</line><line>Karma:
Under arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.
</line><line>Judge:
Then... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...
</line><line>Karma:
<textEffects>Innocent</textEffects>. In this case, at least.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
There are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Karma:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

That is all. The court is adjourned!

</line><line>Judge:
D-did someone just say "objection"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...)</textEffects> No... Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I object to your judgment.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's <textEffects>guilty</textEffects>! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh! What do I do?)</textEffects>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.
</line><line>Judge:
You mean... in the incident where your father died?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for <textEffects>DL-6</textEffects>, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to another crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...
</line><line>Karma:
Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!
</line><line>Judge:
I think... I think I would like to take a five minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!

I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal! I mean, you... kill your dad?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This is crazy! Just crazy!
</line><line>Maya:
... ...? Nick? What are you doing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.
</line><line>Maya:
Your case... for what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your "<textEffects>nightmare</textEffects>."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this <textEffects>Court Record</textEffects>. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.

<line>Judge:
Then, I would like to resume our trial.
</line><line>Karma:
Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Does the defense have any objections?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. <textEffects>(von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Karma:
Will the witness state his name and profession.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.
</line><line>Karma:
Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... It is correct.
</line><line>Karma:

<line>Edgeworth:
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.
My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.
I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.
A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.
It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.
That's all.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a "<textEffects>dream</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.
</line><line>Karma:
Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.

Yes, Your Honor.

Look at the "Victim Data" in this file! It says quite plainly: "<textEffects>the murder weapon was fired twice</textEffects>"! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was <textEffects>fired twice</textEffects>! The first shot was the accidental firing when the pistol was thrown. So... who fired the remaining shot!?

Your Honor. As I'm sure you're aware... This incident occurred fifteen years ago. The evidence is dated... The pistol did <textEffects>fire twice</textEffects>. However, we do not know WHEN that second shot was fired. It might have been fired the day before the incident! There is no proof that the second shot had anything to do with this incident!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I see, I see. You do have a point. Mr. Wright? The murder weapon was <textEffects>fired twice</textEffects>, as we have heard. One of those shots was fired by the defendant, a boy at the time. Do you have any proof that the other shot fired had something to do with the case?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.
</line><line>Karma:
Wh-what!? Impossible!
</line><line>Judge:
Now, now, Mr. von Karma. Save your surprise for after you've seen the evidence. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show us your proof. Do you have evidence that the second firing of the pistol is related to this incident?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Look at this photograph.
</line><line>Judge:
This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. I can see that the victim lying there is Gregory Edgeworth...
</line><line>Phoenix:
This proves the murder weapon was fired twice, at the time of the incident! This photo proves it!
</line><line>Karma:
...
</line><line>Judge:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Gregory Edgeworth was killed by a shot from the pistol! Yet, there is also a bullet hole in the elevator door! We also know that the murder weapon was <textEffects>fired twice</textEffects>! Thus... Someone other than Edgeworth fired that second shot!

It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, <textEffects>two shots</textEffects> were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by <textEffects>someone else</textEffects>!

</line><line>Karma:
... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the "Case Summary" page.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The "Case Summary"... that's on page 1.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Look what is written there! "Not a single clue was found on the scene."
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Karma:
If the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then <textEffects>the other bullet</textEffects> would have been discovered on the scene!
</line><line>Judge:
He does have a point.
</line><line>Karma:
That second bullet has never been found! Why? Because <textEffects>the second bullet</textEffects> does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is <textEffects>the single bullet</textEffects> fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim.
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.
</line><line>Phoenix:

... I'm sorry, Maya.
</line><line>Maya:
What?

I... It looks like I was wrong.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!
</line><line>Maya:
N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Karma:
Precisely.
</line><line>Judge:
I would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Do you have any objections?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... No, I do not.
</line><line>Judge:
So you killed your father, though that was not your intention?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Yes, I did.
</line><line>Maya:
... Oh no... He's confessing... ...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here...

Right now!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. Does anyone have any objections?

Huh?

It that was the case, then he would have taken the bullet from inside Gregory as well!

Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.

E-Edgeworth!?

I know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would leave a doctor as a witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
So... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!

No... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... <textEffects>(Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright! Can you produce evidence to prove that I was shot?

<line>Phoenix:
Alright, von Karma. I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much.
</line><line>Karma:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!
</line><line>Judge:
...! You... you don't mean!

I do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!

</line><line>Phoenix:
The statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!
</line><line>Karma:
Mm... mmmph!
</line><line>Judge:
Enough! I permit the use of the metal detector. Mr. von Karma, you will submit yourself for testing!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! What does this mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know... but we have to give it a shot!

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
... Mr. von Karma...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... You! It was you!
</line><line>Karma:
... I was afraid this would happen. And so, I remained silent.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...?
</line><line>Karma:
Indeed, there is a bullet in my shoulder. However... it has nothing to do with this incident!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Karma:
I was shot in the shoulder long before the DL-6 Incident! I claim that the bullet in my shoulder has no relation to DL-6!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but, Mr. von Karma! Can you prove that?
</line><line>Karma:
"Prove"? I have no obligation to prove anything! It is you who must prove something here, Mr. Wright! Not I.
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright? Well? Can you prove it? Can you prove that the bullet in von Karma's shoulder was from DL-6?
</line><line>Karma:
Of course he can't! You don't have any of the DL-6 evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
With no proof, you cannot convict me of any crime! So sorry, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma.
</line><line>Karma:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were close... one day away from freedom. You see... I have proof!
</line><line>Karma:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!
</line>


<line>Judge:
Th-that's... A bullet?
</line><line>Karma:
Where did you get that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all <textEffects>the ballistic markings intact</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ballistic markings...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Ballistic markings are <textEffects>the fingerprints of a weapon</textEffects>. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from <textEffects>the same gun</textEffects>! The very same pistol... in other words, <textEffects>the murder weapon</textEffects> that killed Gregory Edgeworth!
</line><line>Karma:
Mmmph... mmmph!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?
</line><line>Karma:
Mmmrrrrrrgggh! Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
</line><line>Uaaaaarrrr... aaa...oooh. Worrrrrrrggg... aaa...oooooh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!
</line>
<hr />
<line>"H-help! I can't breathe!"
</line><line>"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!"

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was <textEffects>you who screamed</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. von Karma?
</line><line>Karma:
Wooorrrrrrroooorrgggh Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth...... Only...you would... dare...defy me...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So... it was you!
</line><line>Karma:
You and your father are my curse! Your father shamed me with a penalty on my record! And you... you left a scar on my shoulder that would never fade! I... I'll bury you! I'll bury you with my bare hands! Death! Death!
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Fifteen years earlier...</textEffects></captions>
<line>Karma:
Mr. Chief Prosecutor... I am sorry.
</line><line>von Karma! It's not like you to make this kind of error... I never would have thought that Edgeworth would be the one to catch you.
</line><line>Karma:
I... was careless.
</line><line>I'm sorry, but you will have to be penalized. I've covered for you in the past, but not this time.
</line><line>Karma:
...! Edgeworth!!!
</line><line>It was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what?
</line><line>Karma:
What are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!
</line><line>Judge:
V-very well.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It appears that we have come a very long way to the end of this maze. Fifteen years later... Mr. Miles Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
You were innocent. You are innocent.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
As you said, it was all a "nightmare."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

<line>Maya:
Nick! Nick! We did it! Did you see his face!? von Karma looked even paler than usual! He's pretending to be all cool, but inside you crushed him, Nick! Crushed! I gotta say, I'm impressed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heh... It was pretty close, though. I was sure we'd had it.
</line><line>Maya:
I know, I was on the verge of tears the whole time, myself. But now it's all just a good memory!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, it's finally over, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I... I'm not sure how to say this.
</line><line>Maya:
I know! I know! Try "thank you."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... I see. ... Th-thank you, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-you're welcome.
</line><line>Maya:
I think you could have done better than that!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oof! S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing.
</line><line>Maya:
You got a lot to learn, Edgeworth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Dear, dear...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whoooooooooooooop! Amazing, pal! You pulled through just like I thought you would! I'll never forget this! I owe you one, pal. And tonight, let's party! Dinner's on me! Yeah, my salary went down again a bit this month... But who cares!
</line><line>Maya:
See, Mr. Edgeworth? You should take a lesson from Detective Gumshoe! That's how you say "thank you"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mmm. I... I see. *ahem* Whooooooooooooop! ... I... I feel foolish.
</line><line>Maya:
Don't worry. Take it a little at a time. You'll get used to it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's been fifteen years since I've seen Edgeworth this... unguarded.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
Hey, y'all!
</line><line>Maya:
Lotta!
</line><line>Lotta:
Y'all were great in there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you!
</line><line>Lotta:
Yo, Edgeworth! Congrats!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Er... thank y'all very much.
</line><line>Lotta:
I knew you were innocent from the start, of course. Just look at you! You wouldn't stick your hand in the cookie jar even if no one was there!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You... were the witness on the first day of the trial, weren't you.
</line><line>Lotta:
Yeah, well, let bygones be bygones, eh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Speaking of which, what are you doing now, Lotta?
</line><line>Lotta:
Who, me? Aww, I went back to college. I gave up trying to be an investigative photographer pretty quick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Really? That's too bad.
</line><line>Lotta:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
?
</line><line>Lotta:
Isn't that the hotdog guy from the park?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Butz:
It's over, Nick! My life is over!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-why the sad face, Larry!? What happened now!?
</line><line>Butz:
Oh, Nick... I'm not long for this world.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... you don't look sick...
</line><line>Butz:
It's Kiyance! Sh-she's goin' to live in Paris! Paris, Nick! She's leaving me behind!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Larry, Larry...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Butz:
Yo, Edgey! There you are!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Um, yes, here I am.
</line><line>Butz:
Congrats, Edgey! Here... a little gift from me in celebration!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Celebration? That's unusual for you.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Harry Butz! You come along tonight too! My treat, pal!
</line><line>Butz:
Huh? Uh... thanks! Looking forward to it! (Yo, yo, Nick! That's the suit that questioned me! When he says treat... that's not police-talk for prison food, right? Right?)
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, I think you'll be fine, Larry.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah? What's up?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's $38.00, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?
</line><line>Maya:
N-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you so surprised about, Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Larry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Think back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw the money lying there... and the rest is history.
</line><line>Butz:
I never was good at History! Heh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole class was against you, remember?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... too well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know, I know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Really, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!
</line><line>Butz:
Well, this is sure an unexpected turn of events, eh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You should have told me!
</line><line>Maya:
Now, now, Nick. It was fifteen years ago! Don't you think the "statute of limitations" has run out, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'd say so, yes.
</line><line>Butz:
There you have it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, I'd call you a goody-two-shoes to the extreme.
</line><line>Butz:
Yeah! And you get worked up too easily, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I thought I might be a criminal. I became a prosecutor in part to punish myself. If I had known the truth, I might have become a defense attorney after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Want to switch, Wright?
</line><line>Lotta:
Hey, y'all! Line up, I'll take a photo!
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, photo time! Let's go!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And after that, dinner on me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe took us out on the town that night. We celebrated Edgeworth's new found freedom. Although, Edgeworth was still in detention.

<line>Phoenix:
Whoa... I went a little overboard yesterday. My head hurts... Huh? It's still only 5:00. Maybe I should go back to sleep... Hmm? <textEffects>(What's this? A letter?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Good morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(G-goodbye!?)</textEffects> What time is it? Gah! The first trains for the mountains have already left! To the station!
</line>

<line>Phoenix:

...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Maya:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So... you're leaving?
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah. It's hard being a spirit medium who can't talk to spirits. And... I think you'll do fine without me, Nick. Be good... okay!

W-wait!
</line><line>Maya:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I never could have saved Edgeworth without your help.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
On the last day of the trial... I heard her. I heard Mia's voice!
</line><line>Maya:
You heard my sister...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... only her voice, but still... It was at the very end when I thought we'd lost everything.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, that's my sister for you. Detective Gumshoe helped, and Mr. Grossberg, and even Larry... I'm the only one who couldn't help. I was useless, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you were the one who stopped von Karma, Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? I-I didn't do anything! All I did was wander around in a daze...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but I have evidence that you helped!
</line><line>Maya:
E-evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:

Then he hung his head low and went right back outside. Kind of like he was embarrassed or something. Strange, huh?

<hr />
<line>Butz:
Huh? Nick? Nah, haven't seen him lately. Who, me? I've been working at a cheese shop! That's Missy's a nice lady, but she's not exactly what you'd call a "cheap date". Huh? Oh, she's in Hawaii right now, yeah...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Payne:
Who? Wright? Yeah, I remember him. I hear he's busy lately. You know, not to ring my own bell, but I sort of taught him everything he knows. I'm sure he's grateful.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Bellboy:
Phoenix Wright...? Hmm... Ah! The defense attorney for whom I wrote that affidavit for, yes! Oh, you should know, I've taken over management for the Gatewater hotel recently. Should you be in the area, please, stop by...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Grossberg:*Ah-HHHHEM!* Hmm? Oh, it's you. Phoenix Wright? Ah yes, Mia's understudy, was he not? I wonder how he's doing. Haven't seen him of late... "Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Oldbag:
Phoenix Wright...? He an actor? Well, I'm not buying it! You can't be a star with a name like "Phoenix"! Did you finally know they're putting out some of Hammer's old movies out on DVD in one of them box set thingies that you can buy now-a-days and all not that I know what a "DVD" is or why they use three-letter words for just about everything these days how am I supposed to keep it all straight anyhow, hmm?

I'm pleased to announce the Pink Princess is a hit! I sure owe that Mr. Wright a great deal. *sniff* Oh, and I'm keeping my face out of the public eye until the show's over. I wouldn't want to ruin any kids' dreams, you know.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Penny:
Oh, I got a letter from Maya the other day. It sounds like she caught a cold standing under a waterfall. I wanted to visit, but didn't have time, so I sent her some Pink Princess trading cards. She says she can't buy them where she is. What kind of place is she living at anyway?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Cody:
Wright? Who's that? You wanna talk? Let's talk Pink Princess! Alright! But... you know. I snuck into the studio the other day. And I saw her... the one inside the Pink Princess suit! Ugh! What a dog! It was kind of a shock for a boy of my tender age.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lotta:
Yeah, I remember Wright! That lawyer guy! Huh, me? I'm in training to become a paranormal photographer! You know that picture I took of everyone? Well, just behind them there's a ghost! For real! Now that's talent! I'm gonna be famous!
