</line><line>Maya:
Hey...it's Patty's shop! Maaaaan, this place really brings back some memories!
</line><line>Luke:
Mmmm... I recognise this yummy smell!
</line><line>Espella:
I want to surprise Aunt Patty today, so I've kept our visit a <textEffects>secret</textEffects>.
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, Mrs Eclaire's bakery... It has been a while. I hope she's as jovial as ever.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, look! It's Constantine. I wonder what he's doing here.
</line><line>Constantine:
Grrrrr...
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick! Check out those pearly whites. He looks really happy to see you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Happy</textEffects> to see me? More like happy to have his favourite blue chew toy...
</line><line>Eve:
Meow...
</line><line>Luke:
Oh, look! Eve's here too. And looking as cute as ever!
</line><line>Maya:
I wonder if Constantine and Eve are <textEffects>friends</textEffects> now... Hey, Luke. Why don't you ask and find out?
</line><line>Luke:
Umm...okay. But you do realise these things are pretty personal questions, Maya. Even for a dog... So, Constantine... Are you and Eve on friendly terms now?
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Ruff...woof!
</line><line>Luke:
He said: "Friendship has no place on the battlefield! 'Tis nothing more than a fool's errand for a dog of knightly honour!"
</line><line>Maya:
Affectionate as ever, Constantine! Not sure I'd call this place a "battlefield", exactly...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Did anyone else notice that Eve is chewing on an éclair?
</line><line>Espella:
Oh, Eve... You can't go eating Aunt Patty's pastries like that!
</line><line>Eve:
...Meow.
</line><line>Luke:
Just a moment, Espella! Eve said that the éclair was a <textEffects>present</textEffects> from Constantine!
</line><line>Maya:
Wow! Really...? Luke, do that "animal whisper" thing again, and dig up some more dirt!
</line><line>Luke:
Uhh... Okay, Maya. You've really taken quite an interest in their personal lives, haven't you? Is it true, Constantine? Did you give Eve that éclair as a present?
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof, ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
Constantine said that he doesn't recall having given anyone a present.
</line><line>Maya:
Hear that, Nick? Constantine gave Eve a present. You could learn a thing or two from him...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...? What could I possibly learn from a dog?!
</line><line>Constantine:
Grrrrr...rrrrr... Ruff ruff ruff...woof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAARGH! AAAAAAHH! Why me?! Why does he always bite me...?!
</line><line>Layton:
Perhaps he's merely expressing a fondness for you... Now then, shall we all go on in and see Mrs Eclaire?

</line><line>Luke:
Wow...the smell of freshly baked bread!
</line><line>Layton:
This must be the work of a true artisan, Luke.

</line><line>Barnham:
Buy it. Take it. Eat it.
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm... It would appear we have found a baker quite proficient in the use of cutting-edge methods, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
...He has such a fearsome expression as he's kneading that dough.
</line><line>Layton:
Rather than "kneading" the dough, I'd say he's "punishing it into submission", Luke.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can almost hear the agonising screams of that poor, defenceless dough...
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah. I bet the poor lump is wishing it had never been made...
</line><line>Espella:
Um... Excuse me...Mr Barnham. ...The guests have arrived.
</line><line>Barnham:
Hm...? Well, well, well... If it isn't Sir Blue Knight, the daunting defender of justice! ...And the intrepid Sir Top Hat, no less! I welcome you back to Labyrinthia, and insist that you enjoy your stay.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't "insist" while drawing your sword and waving it in our faces...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Barnham:
Ah, the <textEffects>witch trials</textEffects>... They seem like but a dream from long ago... 'Tis hard to believe they truly happened.
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, it is. Especially given how peaceful the town now seems.
</line><line>Luke:
But then... Why are you still wearing your <textEffects>armour</textEffects>, Mr Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
According to the mistress of the bakery, a baker's apron is his armour. Thus, I choose to wear my armour as my apron, while doing battle with the dough both fairly and squarely.
</line><line>Maya:
I've gotta admit, I'd expect nothing less from "Ex-Inquisitor" Barnham. He's baking Barnham-style, I guess.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're not wrong, Maya... But I've gotta say...I never pictured you becoming a baker, Barnham.
</line><line>Espella:
Well, actually, Mr Barnham is only a <textEffects>part-time</textEffects> baker.
</line><line>Maya:
Just a little side job, huh?
</line><line>Espella:
He's kindly agreed to stay here for a while and help out in the shop.
</line><line>Barnham:
I, err...have recently found myself in need of some extra coin. What little I make here helps out a bit. And living here also means that Constantine gets to eat all the fresh éclair he desires.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that "present" to Eve was a leftover...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Anyway, how come you need money so bad? Are you paying back a loan on that armour or something?
</line><line>Layton:
As fearlessly direct as ever, Miss Fey.
</line><line>Barnham:
Well, in truth...I am planning to use the extra money to buy something special. You could say...a <textEffects>gift</textEffects>, of sorts...
</line><line>Maya:
What?! Did you say "gift"? So, who's the lucky lady, Barnham?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...L-lucky lady? Assuming it IS for a girl, I wouldn't get your hopes up, Maya...
</line><line>Barnham:
........................ I-I have just noticed the dough for the bread rolls is now prime and ready for the flames! I-if you will excuse me...
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! Barnham...
</line><line>Barnham:
Soft doughy rolls, delight of Labyrinthia! May the fire's embrace bake you!
</line><line>Luke:
Professor! There goes that agonising scream from the dough again...and it's intensified!
</line><line>Layton:
Well, my boy, I'm sure it's all part and parcel of the roll-making process.
</line><line>Maya:
But I wonder... is Patty even <textEffects>paying</textEffects> him for any of this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well...since he's staying at the bakery too, I guess he's like a live-in <textEffects>apprentice</textEffects>.
</line><line>Luke:
An...apprentice? Is that normal for a bakery?
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm... Well, the apprenticeship system has been around since the Middle Ages...albeit not generally in the field of bread-making.
</line><line>Maya:
Anyway, worst-case scenario, I guess she'll at least be <textEffects>paying him in bread</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I suppose bread would be <textEffects>better than nothing</textEffects>...
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Hold it right there... Did my ears deceive me...or did you just say "worst-case scenario"...?</textEffects></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
Th-that voice... I know that voice...
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center><textEffects>And what's more... ...I could have sworn I just heard the words "better than nothing".</textEffects></center>
<line>
Maya:
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-<textEffects>boss</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
YIKES! I mean...h-hey there, <textEffects>Patty</textEffects>!
</line><line>Patty:
Now, I'm sure you both know what happens in MY bakery... when you belittle the importance of bread, do you not?
</line><line>Maya:
No... Not the rolling pin! Quick, Barnham! Help us! H-he's gone!
</line><line>Patty:
Right, you two... Prepare yourselves... Because there's no backing away now... from this delightfully challenging <textEffects>puzzle</textEffects> that has absolutely nothing to do with bread!
</line>

<line>
Patty:
Really, Espella... You should have let me know in advance that you were planning to invite everyone here! If I'd known, I could have prepared a big batch of my best hot buns!
</line><line>Espella:
I'm sorry, Aunt Patty... I wanted to surprise you.
</line><line>Patty:
Phoenix, Maya, how have you both been? I bet you're really rolling in the dough these days, aren't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, we can't complain, I mean, we make enough to get by. Unless...I wonder if we're talking about the same thing here...
</line><line>Maya:
I, uhh...don't think it matters either way, Nick.
</line><line>Luke:
Phew...looks like that puzzle helped calm Mrs Eclaire down a bit.
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Luke. I'm delighted to see that friendly smile once again.
</line><line>Espella:
Oh! I almost forgot...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's up, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
I need to prepare a <textEffects>present</textEffects> too...
</line><line>Luke:
Really? You too, Espella?
</line><line>Maya:
So...who's your present for, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
It's for Eve... Her birthday's coming up soon.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow, no kidding? ...Eve's <textEffects>birthday</textEffects>, huh... ...Wait! Didn't Barnham say something about a super-special <textEffects>gift</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't mean...he's been baking a present for Eve's birthday?
</line><line>Luke:
Now that's a surprise! Do you think maybe Mr Barnham has a soft spot for Miss Eve?
</line><line>Layton:
I must confess, this is rather intriguing.
</line><line>Maya:
Aww! That's so <textEffects>romantic</textEffects>! Wouldn't you say, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, y-yeah... I guess so.
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
I will say this but one time... Romance has no place on the battlefield. 'Tis nothing more than a fool's errand for a baker of knightly honour!
</line><line>Phoenix:
