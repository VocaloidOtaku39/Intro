   <poem> 
       <verse n="1"><person>Booker T.</person> Was a practical man. He said, <quote><action>Till</action> the
        soil And <action>learn</action> from the <place>land</place>. Let down your
        <container>bucket</container> Where you are. Your fate is here And not
        <distance>afar</distance>. To <action>help</action> yourself And your fellow man,
        <action>Train</action> your head, Your heart, and your hand.</quote></verse>
        <!-- This is a reference to a quote by Booker T. Washington he made while giving out a speech in Atlanta in 1895. -->
       
        <verse n="2">For smartness alone's Surely not <action>meet</action>— If you haven't at the same time Got
        something to <action>eat</action>. Thus at Tuskegee He <action>built</action> a <place
            located="Tuskegee">school</place> With book-learning there And the workman's tool.
        <!-- This is a reference to the time when Booker established the Tuskegee Institute. --> He
        started out In a simple way— For <time>yesterday</time> Was not <time>today</time>.</verse> 
       
       <verse n="3">Sometimes he had Compromise in his talk— For a man must <action>crawl</action> Before he can walk— And
        in <state>Alabama</state> in <year is="1885">'85</year> A joker was <feeling>lucky</feeling>
        To be alive. But <person>Booker T.</person> Was nobody's fool: You may <action using="tool"
            >carve</action> a dream With an humble tool. The tallest <building>tower</building> Can
        <action>tumble</action> down If it be not <action dest="ground">rooted</action> In solid
        ground. </verse>
       
       <verse n="4">So, being a far-seeing Practical man, He <action>said</action>, <quote>Train your
            head, Your heart, and your hand. Your fate is here And not <distance>afar</distance>, So
            let down your <container>bucket</container> Where you are.</quote></verse></poem>
