Harebrayne:
Good morning to you, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, good morning, Professor. Ready for today's proceedings?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Good morning, my dear fellows!</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">My dear fellows, I must interject!</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? I don't follow.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...if I must agree, then...
</line><line>Sholmes:
As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my... Iris has been busy.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Sorry to cut in...</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?
</line><line>Gregson:
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Poor Professor...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What paperwork?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.
</line><line>Gregson:
You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.
</line><line>Susato:
That... That mass murderer's?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.
</line><line><textEffects>The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, much obliged, Gregson.
</line><line>Gregson:
Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.
</line><line>Susato:
I wish you the best of luck, Professor!
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...
</line><line>Susato:
Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>24th October, 9:30 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom</textEffects></captions>
<line>
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution is ready, My Lord.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... The defence is ready, My Lord. <textEffects>(As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
If I may, Lord van Zieks...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes, My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
There appears to be someone standing at your side...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.
</line><line>Susato:
I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.
</line><line>Judge:
It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.
</line><line>Judge:
Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...
</line><line>Judge:
If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
It was...WHAT?!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
An explosion?!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
This...is an outrage!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, yes... A terrible business...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
That Enoch Drebber...
</line><line>Judge:
The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.
</line><line><textEffects>The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was <textEffects>the accused himself</textEffects> who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.
</line><line>Judge:
Names, Counsel, if you please.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
State your name and occupation for the court.
</line><line>Drebber:
Name...<textEffects>Enoch Drebber</textEffects>. Occupation... ...<textEffects>hard to pin down</textEffects>, I would say.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">See that black monocle?Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.Hm...</captions>
<line>
Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.
</line><line>Drebber:
...But that <textEffects>has no bearing</textEffects> on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes...you could say that. <textEffects>I am aware</textEffects> of it. There was <textEffects>a terrible accident</textEffects>, wasn't there?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But <textEffects>that's all</textEffects>.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... <textEffects>An amazing device</textEffects>, if you ask me. <textEffects>The pinnacle</textEffects> of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Judge:
Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was <textEffects>bona fide</textEffects>? Is that your belief, sir?
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You've established nothing of the sort.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome <textEffects>could have been produced</textEffects> by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...but...
</line><line>Judge:
We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.
</line><line>Drebber:
...Understood.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Kinesis Machine -</textEffects></captions>
<line>Drebber:
I met <textEffects>the young professor</textEffects> approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.
He provided me with the blueprints and I <textEffects>constructed</textEffects> the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.
If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required <textEffects>a body double</textEffects>. Tell me...did the victim have a twin?
<textEffects>All the spectators</textEffects> saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.
A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was <textEffects>flawed</textEffects> somehow?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
A, a body double?!
</line><line>Drebber:
That <textEffects>goes without saying</textEffects>, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic <textEffects>conjuring</textEffects> principle. The deception cannot be achieved without <textEffects>substituting</textEffects> the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything <textEffects>along those lines</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.
</line><line>Drebber:
...Whatever do you <textEffects>mean</textEffects>?
</line><line>Judge:
Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.
</line><line>Drebber:
...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of <textEffects>stage magic</textEffects>. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of <textEffects>any</textEffects> academic in the field.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!
</line><line>Drebber:
If a hypothesis is <textEffects>sound</textEffects>, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold <textEffects>the secrets</textEffects> of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.
</line><line>Judge:
Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...
</line><line>Drebber:
An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by <textEffects>misuse</textEffects> of the science.
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel for the Defence...your cross-examination, please!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
</line>

<textEffects>- The Kinesis Machine -</textEffects></captions>
<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.</textEffects>

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He's certainly very sure of himself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, now that the machine has been completely destroyed by yesterday's explosion... ...it's going to be impossible to argue its authenticity one way or the other.
</line><line>Susato:
But if we're unable to establish that it was a piece of stage trickery rather than genuine science... ...we will have no grounds on which to demonstrate Professor Harebrayne's innocence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Both Mr Asman and this man in the stand tricked the professor and used him. They took advantage of his naivety and his unbending belief in his work...and I won't let them get away with it! <textEffects>(And seeing as the professor is an old friend of Lord van Zieks... ...what on earth must he be feeling towards Drebber?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We know that somehow, the birdcage appeared in mid-air before falling down into the Crystal Tower. A fall of about thirty feet...or nine metres. However, if you examine the diagram carefully... ...you'll see that there is one other possible location from which the birdcage could have fallen... ...the same distance of thirty feet.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No!
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it appears the defence has a possible explanation to put forward. Go ahead, Counsel.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. Of course.
</line><line>Judge:
You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram. <textEffects>The alternative location from which the birdcage could possibly have fallen the requisite thirty feet!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The place I'm referring to...is here!
</line><line>Judge:
But that's... ...where the birdcage would have been to begin with!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which is exactly the point, My Lord. Yes, the birdcage was in the machine on the stage. But what we must also consider, is the height of the stage itself.
</line><line>Judge:
Go on, Counsel.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It turns out that the experimentation stage was built at a considerable height <textEffects>above ground level</textEffects>. If you look at the diagram, in fact... ...you'll see it's at <textEffects>about the same height</textEffects> above the ground as the balloon was above the crash site.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
When the experiment got underway, the machine and the birdcage were engulfed in steam. At that moment, the floor of the stage gave way and, if we assume there to be a void underneath... ...this birdcage and the one seen by the audience would have fallen almost exactly the same distance! Once again, My Lord... ...this all points to the fact that there was not one birdcage, but two!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
My learned friend...has no evidence that the stage had such a contrivance in its design!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Someone is responsible for the criminal destruction of the kinesis machine itself, it's true. However, the stage still stands. And take a moment to look at the photographic print of the scene following yesterday's explosion.
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord! <textEffects>The metal grille</textEffects> that formed the floor of the machine is undone!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, most likely blown open by the force of the explosion that destroyed the rest of the machine. The defence calls for the space below the stage to be investigated...immediately! Mr Drebber!
</line><line>Drebber:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was you who built the kinesis machine. Which means that it was you who built the two birdcages that were used to carry out this deception.
</line><line>Drebber:
Uh...ughhh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Whether Professor Harebrayne's hypothesis is sound or not makes no difference. Because it's the construction of this machine that matters. A machine designed to take Mr Asman's life... ...and lay the blame firmly at the professor's door. Something that could only have been carried out... ...by you, Mr Enoch Drebber!
</line><line>Drebber:
Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If my learned friend has reached the end of his wild assertions... ...the prosecution would like to crush the defence's argument slowly...but surely.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Your argument fails to hold water... ...on two counts.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Two?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Firstly... ...before and after the experiment, this witness went nowhere near the kinesis machine. Every relevant member of staff from the exhibition has attested to that.
</line><line>Judge:
And I believe members of Scotland Yard have also been on watch duty at every public experiment.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
In other words, Mr Drebber had <textEffects>no opportunity</textEffects> to switch the alleged pair of birdcages.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I've already explained why he wouldn't have needed to!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The nonsense with the crossbow? That doesn't bolster your case at all. The man who disappeared from the stage and the man who crashed into the tower are <textEffects>one and the same</textEffects>. The Forensic Investigation Team's report is unequivocal on that point!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And the second flaw in your assertion... ...is a distinct lack of motive. Why would this man have wanted to take the victim's life? He had <textEffects>no reason</textEffects> to do so.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A...a motive...? <textEffects>(Do I have to think of everything myself?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I have here a contract provided by the witness.
</line><line>Judge:
What contract is this, Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The contract into which Mr Drebber entered with the victim, Mr Asman. It reads: 'Mr Drebber is to receive <textEffects>thirty percent</textEffects> of all remunerations from government grants or other income.'
</line><line>Judge:
Thirty percent? Certainly very favourable contractual conditions.
</line><line>Drebber:
But there was one very important <textEffects>provision</textEffects> bolted onto that clause.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What provision?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
'Mr Drebber may only uphold this right on condition that both contracting parties are <textEffects>alive</textEffects>.'
</line><line>Drebber:
In other words, if either of us were to die, the contract would become <textEffects>null and void</textEffects>. So you see, I had <textEffects>nothing to gain</textEffects> from Mr Asman's death. The diametric opposite, in fact.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Need I say more? The witness had neither an opportunity nor a reason to commit the alleged crime. In short, the possibility of Mr Drebber having done as you suggest...is nil.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... It seems the defence's assertion was somewhat wide of the mark. Lord van Zieks...you will submit the contract as evidence, please.
</line><line><textEffects>Drebber's contract has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's true... If Drebber had no opportunity to switch the birdcage under the stage with the one in the Crystal Tower... ...he couldn't have done it. And in any case, I have no idea what his motive might have been!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
There is one aspect of your argument... ...that still holds true, however.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
There were <textEffects>two</textEffects> birdcages. The prosecution is unable to deny that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah...
</line><line>Susato:
So I'm sure you're on the right lines, Mr Naruhodo. And I've no doubt there are other aspects of your assertion that are undeniable truths, too!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it would seem... ...that the defence has no rejoinder to offer.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... Kuh kuh kuh... Well, I must say I'm a little <textEffects>surprised</textEffects>. I came here to testify about the machine I built, and instead my reputation is <textEffects>defiled</textEffects>. But the prosecution's counter has <textEffects>set the record straight</textEffects>, I think. It's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects> that I'm the culprit.

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At the beginning of this trial, we believed that there was only one birdcage. Yet now we know there must have been two. In other words, there was more to the demonstration than we realised at first.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I think it's abundantly clear that the same applies to the culprit.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Get to the point.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The stage demonstration... ...was constructed and set up in its entirety by you, Mr Drebber. Therefore it's inconceivable that you had no hand in the events that transpired.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So if circumstances mean it's impossible that you could have carried out the crime <textEffects>yourself</textEffects>... ...it points to the fact that <textEffects>someone else</textEffects> was involved.
</line><line>Judge:
Someone else? Counsel, are you suggesting...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! Mr Drebber had <textEffects>an accomplice</textEffects>!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
An accomplice now? Well then, I presume... ...you're prepared for what's to come? Now that you're accusing not only this witness, but someone else...of the most serious of crimes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If these accusations turn out to be false... ...then make no mistake: The prosecution will demand an equally serious punishment for your slander!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Counsel? Do you intend to pursue this course, and formally accuse another party of involvement in this matter?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(What do I do here? At the moment, this is little more than a hunch on my part. I don't know for sure if Drebber had an accomplice, or even if he really is the culprit here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(One way or another, though, I have to make my position clear. ...As a lawyer. So what's my stance going to be? Did Drebber have an accomplice...or not?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice! <textEffects>(Somehow the two birdcages must have been switched. Everything points to that. Yet according to the coroner's report, that's not a possibility. But that inconsistency itself is a clue!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...My Lord?!
</line><line>Judge:
You have received a stark warning already. If you are nevertheless determined... ...then I must now ask you to identify this alleged accomplice by name. So...your answer, please. <textEffects>Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The name of the person in question is...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What's wrong, my Nipponese friend? Surely fear doesn't bind your tongue now. It's a little late for that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Of course I'm afraid. After all, naming her in this capacity is definitely going to make waves. ...A lot of waves. I could very well turn every single person in this courtroom against me.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I'm sure it will be alright, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Miss Susato.
</line><line>Susato:
The enemy always appears larger than life. But you'll appear exactly the same to the enemy!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Alright then, here goes...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You've kept us waiting long enough. Your answer, Counsel...now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The person who colluded with Mr Drebber in order to carry out this wicked crime... ...is Scotland Yard's coroner, <textEffects>Dr Courtney Sithe</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What, what the blazes are you talking about? Dr Sithe?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The head of the Forensic Investigation Team, and the coroner who conducted the autopsy on the victim?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We know there were two birdcages. So who could have carried out the switch to complete the illusion? The 'accident' happened in front of a huge crowd of spectators, and the area was immediately sealed off. Then everyone, police officers included, were banished to make way for the Forensic Investigation Team. When else could the switch have occurred? It can only have been in that team's presence.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's essential that the court determines exactly what happened following the incident. The defence demands that Dr Sithe be summoned to the witness stand at once to testify!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
You've got a nerve, lad! Standing up there, dragging the Yard's name through the mud!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I didn't mean to...
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
I know the woman veeery well. There's no better dead room worker out there! How dare you call her a criminal?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My learned friend's imagination appears to be wilder than the East End at night.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But the recklessness of your accusation aside, there's another grave problem with your argument. One which the prosecution demands you address at once.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A grave problem?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my word...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Who do you claim acted as the victim's <textEffects>doppelgänger</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
W-What?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Certainly, if the 'birdcage' containing the body of the victim was exchanged for another... ...that cage must also have contained a body.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And yet... ...no missing persons or accidental deaths of anyone even remotely resembling the victim have been reported. Which means there was no one, dead or alive, who could have fulfilled the role of a body double for Mr Asman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(That's true! If my argument is that there were two birdcages, then there must also have been one person inside each! But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I? What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?)</textEffects>

<line>Ryunosuke:
We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage. And therefore he couldn't have been inside the second birdcage. Instead, that contained something else... What's been described as a 'body double', which is what fell from the sky and crashed into the Crystal Tower.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Counsel, according to your somewhat elaborate version of events.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that 'body double' inside the second birdcage was in fact... .........
</line><line>Susato:
It's alright, Mr Naruhodo. You're ready for this. Just steel yourself...and come out with it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Miss Susato! I needed that. As I was saying...the 'body double' inside the second birdcage was... ...as unbelievable as it may seem...that thing there!

</line><line>Van Zieks:
You started by indicting the leader of the Forensic Investigation Team as an accomplice in this crime. And now you've moved on to indicting waxworks?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes! That's about the size of it.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But why? And why THIS waxwork? It looks nothing like the victim. In fact, it could hardly resemble him less! What possible justification can you give?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If you want to know why... ...ask Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Drebber:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Just days before Professor Harebrayne performed his public demonstration... ...Mr Drebber <textEffects>abducted</textEffects> this model from Madame Tusspells.
</line><line>Judge:
Did, did you say...abducted?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And two days after the incident at the Great Exhibition... ...he returned it to the museum.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Then the timing...
</line><line>Judge:
Is this true, Mr Drebber?
</line><line>Drebber:
Ugh... Urmm...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At first, I couldn't see why Mr Drebber would have stolen the waxwork and then given it back again. But now, the reason is clear. He took it so that he could put it inside the second birdcage...as a body double for Mr Asman!
</line><line>Drebber:
Guh...............!

Really? A reason why nothing else would do, you mean?

Yes. And I'm convinced... ...it's something far more significant than whether or not the model looked like the victim.

Yes, it's a piece of broken glass that we found inside the jacket on the waxwork. As you say, it's not ordinary glass, though. It's very thick, and clearly made for extra strength. Much like the special glass that was developed for the construction of the Crystal Tower.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
The Crystal To- Holy smoke!

Exactly! The centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, where the very incident we're talking about took place! On the day in question, the birdcage fell from above and smashed through a window of that special glass.

From whence this small piece originated...is that it?

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Right. Yes!
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>After Jurors No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 vote innocent:</i>
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Counsel, that will do. As a result of the summation examination, the jury's overall leaning has changed. Two jurors now call guilty. Against four who call not guilty. Accordingly the court has failed to reach a consensus at this time... ...and the trial must continue!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We, we did it!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! Another wonderful victory!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmmm, a waxwork of the despicable Professor... ...used as a 'body double' for the victim in this quite extraordinary case... I must say, it's extremely hard to believe the assertion could possibly be true. However, it would appear that it does at least warrant further investigation.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's the waxwork of the Professor that links Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe. And I'm convinced that there's a special significance to that link!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
I don't know what you're hoping to prove, lad, I really don't!
</line><line>Susato:
The truth, sir. By using evidence and testimony.
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Hmph.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If the court is to delve deeper into the alleged involvement of the waxwork in this case... ...then the prosecution calls for the owner of the model to be summoned as a witness.
</line><line>Judge:
The owner?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Madame Tusspells.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(I, I really thought... ...that Lord van Zieks would object to this whole line of enquiry...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, I concur. Make arrangements for Madame Tusspells to appear as a witness with immediate effect.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Listen carefully, my learned friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh... Yes?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You should know... ...that you're on the brink of opening Pandora's box. .........
</line><line>Judge:
The court shall now adjourn for forty-five minutes. During that time, the prosecution will summon the new witness and prepare her for taking the stand.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Madame Tusspells, yes. I shall see to it at once, My Lord.

Sholmes:
Ah, the knight-errant himself!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, have you been watching from the gallery, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time! Courtroom trials are fascinating affairs. As a spectator, at least.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself...
</line><line>Harebrayne:
I, I have to ask... ...what on earth is going on?! It makes no sense! What's this Professor business all about? He doesn't look like any professor I've ever met before! Who even is he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course... ...you were in Germany already ten years ago.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, the Professor... When I discovered 'he' was the one who had been abducted, a sense of foreboding stirred within me. But who knew the monster would come knocking at your door? My heartfelt sympathies! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As it turns out... ...Lord van Zieks is even more intimately tied to this case than any of us realised, isn't he?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, how true. His great friend from university in the dock...
</line><line>Sholmes:
...And now a waxwork of the killer who took his esteemed brother's life makes an appearance, too. I imagine even the shrewd Mr Reaper failed to foresee that kick in the teeth. An extraordinary move on your part, my dear fellow, to throw that in front of the man.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You make it sound deliberate...
</line><line>Susato:
I can't help feeling... ...that this Professor case is really very puzzling.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh yes? In what particular manner?
</line><line>Susato:
Well, there's Mr Drebber, Dr Sithe and Lord van Zieks... It seems that everybody in the trial has a link to the case somehow.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Yes, in fact I, alone, am not a member of the set! Though that leaves me as an empty set...all alone with no intersection to any other...

Ryunosuke:
D.........D.........Dr Sithe!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, Dr Courtney Sithe, née Stevens. Good day to you.
</line><line>Sithe:
Hello, Sholmes. That was very shrewd of you.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...What in particular, pray?
</line><line>Sithe:
You requested that ten-year-old autopsy report from Gregson, didn't you?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why would you assume such a thing?
</line><line>Sithe:
Because Gregson told me.
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........
</line><line>Sithe:
To think it's been ten years... Ten years in the laboratory, wielding my scalpel. I smell of nothing but corpses and disinfectant.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A policeman on the jury had a lot to say about you as it happens, Dr Sithe. And I've...accused you of being complicit in what happened. I'm hoping that you'll take the stand and tell the truth about what really happened.
</line><line>Sithe:
That certainly won't be possible.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Sithe:
Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart?
</line><line>Sithe:
The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.
</line><line>Susato:
But attempting to hide from the truth... That's cowardice!
</line><line>Sithe:
I've always fought crime in the way that I see fit. I have no regrets. None at all. And that's all I came here to say. So...good day to you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... She mentioned it, too. This Pandora's box...
</line><line>Susato:
Whatever does it all mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
There's really no cause for concern. I assure you, when the trial resumes... ...the meaning will become all too apparent, whether you'd like it to or not.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Now then, I believe it's almost time. I must make my way back to the public gallery. The edge of my seat awaits!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I think maybe you're enjoying yourself a little too much...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Alright, I understand. ...Thank you.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Good. I shall make myself scarce, then. I purchased a bar of caramel earlier, so I shall be gnawing on that as you gnaw away at the truth!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What did that warning from Mr Sholmes really mean, I wonder? Especially the bit about 'whatever may come to pass'... .........)</textEffects>

<line>
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready and able to continue?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution is ready, My Lord.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. The defence is also ready.
</line><line>Judge:
As the court is aware, the case under our scrutiny began with a damaging incident at the Great Exhibition. Yet we now find ourselves embroiled in the details of a convicted felon who was sent to the gallows a decade ago. This trial has certainly defied all expectation.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As seems to be the fate of all trials in which this Nipponese is involved, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
So then... ...let us begin our exploration of the defence's assertion that the waxwork was cardinally involved in this matter. Lord van Zieks...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
Are we still awaiting the arrival of Madame Tusspells?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Not at all. She is in the antechamber as we speak and ready to be summoned.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Bring in the witness!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
At once, My Lord. Bailiff! Show Madame Tusspells to the stand!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Things are about to become a lot more intense. If Drebber is responsible, as I'm sure he is, it means he must have had <span style="color:#E16935">an accomplice</textEffects>...in Dr Sithe.)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
And what <textEffects>connects</textEffects> the pair of them...is the waxwork.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, the model of the Professor... That's the key to the link between these otherwise unrelated individuals. It's a tenuous link, admittedly. But at present, it's all we have to go on.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
State your name and occupation for the court, please.
</line><line>Tusspells:
My name is Madame Esmeralda Tusspells. I am a waxwork artisan. And the proprietress of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork. You will have to pardon me for working as I testify. My new exhibit must open very soon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(Oh, so he finally gets a statue, does he? Now there are two of them in the world...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my... What expression is she carving onto that face?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A number of days ago, a particular waxwork model was stolen from your museum. Can you confirm this?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Oui. That is true. At first, we believed it had been <textEffects>kidnapped</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
A waxwork model? Kidnapped?!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Yes, My Lord. There was a demand for <textEffects>ransom money</textEffects> left behind by the culprit. However, according to what I have just been told outside the courtroom, that was not the true reason. I understand it was utilised as <textEffects>a substitute</textEffects> for the body of a murder victim?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
At present, that is no more than conjecture proposed by the defence. This is the victim of the case in question. Mr Odie Asman.
</line><line>Tusspells:
But of course, I know him well. He is a part of my odious personages exhibit. ...I detest to say what is evident, but Mr Asman does not resemble the Professor at all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, but...perhaps! Perhaps their faces are very <textEffects>similar</textEffects>!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Are you suggesting that we should see now <textEffects>the demasked visage</textEffects> of the Professor? I have here the key, but it is strictly forbidden to open the lock.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
This is absurd!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Pardon?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I don't know what face you've carved onto your fancy figure beneath that mask... ...but clearly it won't be that of the actual killer.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. The man's identity was never made public, after all.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The trial took place in a closed court. The proceedings were strictly confidential. The condemned man was summarily executed. His identity remains a closely guarded national secret. There is no possible way that a repository of tawdry exhibits could get its hands on that information.
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Quel dommage. It would seem you are unaware of the Tusspells' principles.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What principles?
</line><line>Tusspells:
The family Tusspells has always prided itself on sculpting its models à la perfection. Every detail, including the visage, is fashioned with complete fidelity. ...Et voilà: our principles.
</line><line>Susato:
There is a well known legend about the Tusspells waxworks from the time of the French Revolution. A member of the Tusspells family is said to have made a waxwork of the queen who was executed.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Oui, that is true. It was a century ago now.
</line><line>Susato:
I believe the queen's face was carved in the minutes following her death, actually at the guillotine site.
</line><line>Tusspells:
You are correct. The model is on display still today in the House of Horrors. We Tusspells will stop at nothing to obtain a faithful replica of our subjects.
</line><line>Judge:
Dear me... A somewhat disturbing tenacity of purpose.
</line><line>Tusspells:
It is the only way to obtain a truly lifelike representation of the subject. And it has been my family's secret for generations.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do, do you mean to say...that beneath that mask...?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Oui. The true visage of the killer is there.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...This is ludicrous. It's out of the question!
</line><line>Tusspells:
The Professor spread terror throughout Great Britain. As a result, the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit remains extremely popular even today. The killer...emerging from his own grave... It is a sight to behold. You should come.
</line><line>Judge:
I think, madame, it would be beneficial to hear your formal testimony on this matter. You will explain every detail of this macabre model. And your personal involvement in its creation.
</line><line>Tusspells:
...With pleasure.

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>

<line>Tusspells:
The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London.
An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles.
I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.
I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.
As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The gravedigger?! The man sanctioned this?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Oui. I will do all that is necessary to achieve the true resemblance my family is celebrated for. Nobody else knew. Only the gravedigger. What harm did it do, uh?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So you truly saw it? The face of that monster!
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Naturally, I was aware at the time that his identity was a secret. But Tusspells would not be Tusspells if we did not insist on absolute fidelity to our sculptures.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I don't believe this...
</line><line>Judge:
I myself have seen the special exhibit at your museum, madame. A truly blood-curdling scene, in which the murderer is emerging from his own grave.
</line><line>Tusspells:
The scene it depicts was the subject of many rumours in London ten years ago. I have here a newspaper from the time. The special exhibit was based upon the picture in this article. It was the most detailed account of what happened, as reported by the eyewitness who saw it.
</line><line><textEffects>The ten-year-old article has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
'Man Rises from the Grave!'... It's too absurd for words.
</line><line>Tusspells:
The public enjoy absurdity, monsieur. That is why I have reproduced the scene as carefully as possible in my museum.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it's a waxwork from that exhibit that was stolen some days before the incident at the Great Exhibition, wasn't it.
</line><line>Tusspells:
That is correct. The Professor you see before you here.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm... Most puzzling... Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This waxwork links Drebber to Dr Sithe... And there has to be some reason for that, which hasn't yet come to light. But I'll find it. I'll get to the bottom of what really happened. I'll prove that Dr Sithe and Drebber were in on this crime together!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Susato:
What's your feeling, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
For some reason, Dr Sithe went along with Drebber's plan. Now, if that's really true... ...then the Professor is the only other thing we know of that links the pair of them. So I feel sure that waxwork must be a clue to this mystery somehow...
</line><line>Susato:
In that case, we must use this cross-examination to uncover exactly what it means! Otherwise the jurors are sure to revert their leanings and the trial will be over!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I agree. But interestingly... ...uncovering what the Professor has to do with all of this means more to Lord van Zieks than anyone. That's...the impression I'm getting, anyway.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, as do I...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(After all, he has a profound connection to the Professor as well...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Madame Tusspells... I have here an autopsy report that was filed ten years ago now. It confirms the death of the Professor following his execution at the gallows.
</line><line>Tusspells:
And...is that a problem?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I believe it is. Because your testimony, and a particular detail in the report... ...completely contradict one another.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Quoi?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Are you going to explain yourself, my Nipponese friend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to her testimony, Madame Tusspells was creating her wax impression just before dawn. And at that time, rigor mortis had not yet set in. Am I correct so far, madame?
</line><line>Tusspells:
You are, yes. As I said, the stiffening of the jaw is the first sign of rigor mortis, two to three hours after death. But the man's chin was limp, so he cannot have been dead for a long time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But on the other hand, if you look at Dr Sithe's report... ...it quite clearly states the following: 'Death by hanging confirmed at <textEffects>midnight</textEffects>, 17th June.'
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If the Professor indeed died at midnight that day... ...then by the time you were sculpting his face, rigor mortis would already have set in.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Oui! Yes, you are right. The chin, it would have been completely stiff.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In other words, this report...is wrong!

<textEffects>(It's almost impossible to believe, but it would explain <span style="color:#E16935">the link</textEffects>... ...between Dr Sithe, the Professor...and that one other person of interest!)</span> I have evidence that will explain exactly what I'm suggesting happened that night!

Counsel, present the evidence at once! <textEffects>The evidence that allegedly explains what really happened on the night of the Professor's execution!</textEffects>

<line>Ryunosuke:
What happened that night is written very plainly in this newspaper article! 'Executed criminal returns in the dead of night at local cemetery!'
</line><line>Van Zieks:
You're suggesting it was a corpse, coming back from the dead now?!

Well, if this article is to be believed, yes. The Professor, assumed dead following his execution, emerged from his grave...and was killed again!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
On the contrary, My Lord. We all know this witness well!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?
</line><line>Judge:
Are you suggesting, Counsel, that you've identified the person in question? That you know who claims to have seen these utterly incredible events take place?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. <textEffects>(In fact, you could say that he's right here before my very eyes!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You will substantiate your latest claim now then, Counsel. <textEffects>Who is the alleged witness of this staggering scene from the cemetery ten years ago?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Drebber?!
</line><line>Judge:
The, the previous witness?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The special exhibit in the House of Horrors at Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork... ...recreates that decade-old scene in great detail. The condemned criminal emerging from the grave... And beside the tomb... ...a young man with a lantern stumbling upon the terrifying sight. And that young man... ...is a ten-year-younger Mr Enoch Drebber!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Surely not, Counsel?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Drebber was there? In Lowgate Cemetery?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Um... What is all this talk about Mr Drebber? Is the name significant?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Of course. Madam <i>[sic]</i> Tusspells doesn't know, does she?)</textEffects> Yes. It's extremely significant, madame. To your situation as well, in fact.
</line><line>Tusspells:
What situation?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The theft of the Professor waxwork from your museum some days ago... ...was perpetrated by the very same man.
</line><line>Tusspells:
Non! But...but that would mean...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Madame Tusspells... ...it would appear you know the name...Enoch Drebber.
</line><line>Tusspells:
......... Oui. yes, I know it. But from long ago in the past.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my!
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Explain yourself! Tell us everything you know!
</line><line>Tusspells:
Yes... Yes, of course.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">The story of the young man and the terrible sight he witnessed in the cemetery ten years ago... ...was published in every single newspaper in London and throughout Great Britain. However... ...in all of the articles, the witness was simply described as 'a certain young man'. No details were published about his identity. His name was never revealed. That is, apart from in one newspaper.</captions>
<line>
Tusspells:
The Daily Circus. It is the paper from which comes the article I have already shown the court.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're saying that his full name was only publicised in that article?
</line><line>Judge:
Goodness me! Yes, here it is! 'The university student who experienced this shocking event is <textEffects>Mr Enoch Drebber</textEffects>... ...a disciple of science at the University of London, and a resident of its student dorms.'
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Unbelievable!
</line><line>Tusspells:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">When I read the article, I went to meet with the man. His discovery of the condemned criminal coming back to life in the cemetery in the dead of night... ...would make a perfect exhibit for my House of Horrors, whether it was the truth or not.</captions>
<line>
Judge:
I see. So you went to meet Mr Drebber in order to sculpt a waxwork of the man, did you?
</line><line>Tusspells:
Exactement. He was studying science at the University of London in those days. He was just a poor student. I paid him five pounds to model for the waxwork. And since that time, it has been in my museum to recreate the scene of terror from the cemetery.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, ten years ago, a young man appealed to the public about an extraordinary event he'd witnessed: A criminal who had been put to death, re-emerging from his grave in the middle of the night. But the public treated his claim as nothing more than an amusing anecdote...that was soon forgotten. Ten years later... ...the same man steals a waxwork model of the executed criminal... ...ostensibly to use as <textEffects>a body double</textEffects> for the victim in the case we're discussing here today. Even though the waxwork's build is <textEffects>a poor match</textEffects> for the victim, and its face is obscured by a mask. So the question is...why would the man do such a thing?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which brings us to three days ago, when the birdcage crashed into the Crystal Tower. If the birdcage had in fact contained not the body of Mr Asman, but that same waxwork... ...the coroner from Scotland Yard who investigated, Dr Sithe, would have noticed immediately. And yet she submitted this autopsy report for the victim, which the court has seen earlier. Why?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Because the waxwork was that of the Professor, is that what you're saying?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Dr Sithe put her name to a document confirming the death of a condemned criminal who was still alive. A criminal whose apparent 'resurrection' was witnessed by Mr Drebber. But that misconduct was a deadly secret the coroner would do anything to protect. Which is precisely why Mr Drebber used that particular waxwork as the body double!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Aaaaaargh...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My Lord! This court must summon Dr Sithe to the stand! The defence is determined...to find out exactly how the coroner and Mr Drebber are connected!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
But according to the missive I received this morning through the Prosecutor's Office... ...Dr Sithe is unable to participate in these proceedings. Is that not the case?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
She told us so herself, didn't she?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sithe:
Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart?
</line><line>Sithe:
The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Something happened on the night of that killer's execution ten years ago. And surely nobody would want to get to the bottom of that more...than Lord van Zieks!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... The prosecution calls...for the instructions in that missive to be scrapped!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
But, but Lord van Zieks! The missive was issued from the Lord Chief Justice's office.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
The assigned prosecutor has the final say on policy in any particular trial. In other words...me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe...both take the stand together.
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Very well, I will uphold your request. Bailiff! Send a subpoena with immediate effect, addressed to Dr Sithe of the Forensic Investigation Team. The woman is compelled to attend on Her Majesty's orders!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Alright then. Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe... If they weren't colluding with one another, this crime could never have been committed. I'm just a stone's throw away, I can feel it. The truth behind all of this is about to come out!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
Thank you for your attendance at such short notice... Dr Sithe.
</line><line>Sithe:
I'm disappointed in you, Lord van Zieks. You've completely betrayed the agreed policy of both Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Betrayal is not in my nature...as long as the truth isn't compromised. If it is... If there's even a hint of wrongdoing...then no matter whom it concerns or disgruntles... ...I will pursue the matter to the bitter end. As would any prosecutor worth his salt.
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber... ...you took the victim's life by means of a machine that you constructed in your workshop.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And Dr Sithe... ...as the investigating coroner, you were the first on the scene to examine the victim's body. It is the belief of the defence... ...that you collaborated with each other and were <textEffects>both complicit</textEffects> in this crime.
</line><line>Sithe:
And where's your evidence?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At present, we have no definitive evidence. But we do have a very significant clue.
</line><line>Sithe:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm talking, of course, about the waxwork! This model of the killer known as the Professor...who was sentenced to death ten years ago.
</line><line>Sithe:
You don't need to tell me. I witnessed the man's execution with my own eyes. And officially pronounced him dead.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That remains to be seen.
</line><line>Sithe:
Is that so?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to newspaper reports from the time, on the night following his execution... ...the killer came back to life.
</line><line>Sithe:
Tsk! Don't waste my time!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And the sole witness to that mysterious event... ...was you, Mr Drebber, wasn't it?
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If what you saw in the graveyard that night ten years ago wasn't some chilling fiction, but reality... ...it would make you privy to a very great secret of Dr Sithe's. A secret so profound, it could compel the coroner to agree to <textEffects>collaborate</textEffects> in your evil scheme, in fact.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber, tell the court! Tell everyone the truth of what you saw that night in Lowgate Cemetery!
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line>
<captions aligned="center">So he was the student who saw it...
<line>You can see the resemblance actually, can't you? With the man in Madame Tusspells, I mean.
Surely he's not going to claim that's really what he saw. Especially not after all these years.
He was a research student at the University of London, was he?
And a bit too clever for his own good, if you ask me...
</line>
Kuh kuh kuh...</captions>
<line>
Drebber:
What an <textEffects>interesting</textEffects> twist.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...?
</line><line>Drebber:
When at the time, <textEffects>not one person</textEffects> would take me seriously. Yet now here we are, ten years later, and suddenly my story matters. And in <textEffects>a court of law</textEffects>, too. Very well, then. If everyone so <textEffects>wishes</textEffects>. Let's be <textEffects>frank</textEffects>. I'll tell you the truth of what happened that night...for what it's worth.
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
So, Mr Drebber... ...your testimony, please. About the events of that night ten years ago. You will tell the court exactly what you stumbled across in Lowgate Cemetery!
</line><line>Drebber:
<textEffects>Yes</textEffects> of course. As you wish.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- In The Cemetery Ten Years Earlier -</textEffects></captions>
<line>Drebber:
The reason I was in Lowgate Cemetery at all ten years ago was for...a spot of <textEffects>moonlighting</textEffects>, shall we say?
Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on <textEffects>what I witnessed</textEffects> that night.
But thinking back now, I realise that I <textEffects>never actually saw</textEffects> the Professor.
Soon afterwards, I was visited by <textEffects>a young woman</textEffects> who sculpted a model of me from wax.
Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all <textEffects>because of</textEffects> that newspaper article.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Wait a minute! You're, you're claiming you didn't actually see the Professor now?!
</line><line>Drebber:
Of course. You'd have to have a screw loose if you believed a corpse could <textEffects>come back from the dead</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But... So you're saying this article is...
</line><line>Drebber:
...<textEffects>Not worth the paper it's printed on</textEffects>? I think that would describe it perfectly, yes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Susato:
If the details in the article aren't true... ...it nullifies your argument for why Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe would have been working together.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So he's discrediting himself to cripple my argument?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Tell me, witness... ...you claim to have been in the cemetery on some... <textEffects>auxiliary business</textEffects>. Can you elaborate?
</line><line>Drebber:
That's right. <textEffects>Graverobbing</textEffects>, to be precise. As you know, Lowgate Cemetery is at <textEffects>the rear</textEffects> of Barclay Prison. So among students at the university, it had a reputation for being haunted by <textEffects>the ghosts of condemned convicts</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
G-Graverobbing, you say?!
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses <textEffects>to sell</textEffects> is reasonably lucrative. Of course, I <textEffects>never laid a finger</textEffects> on any valuables buried with the dead.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So you were one of the so-called Resurrectionists. A particularly unpleasant scourge on society. 
</line><line>Drebber:
Actually, my fellows and I went by another name: '<textEffects>The Repurposers</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Judge:
That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, well...I think <textEffects>I suffered</textEffects> retribution enough. <textEffects>The Daily Circus</textEffects>...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to <textEffects>leave the university</textEffects>. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me <textEffects>unambiguously</textEffects>, I might add.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I see...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Out of interest, who drew the illustration for this article?
</line><line>Drebber:
Ah yes, that was <textEffects>the reporter</textEffects> who exposed me. He sketched that right in front of me as I described the scene. Obviously, as time ticked on, I <textEffects>bitterly</textEffects> regretted what I'd done. Claiming to have seen something I <textEffects>never truly saw</textEffects>... Foolish. Very foolish.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Well, Counsel for the Defence...you may proceed to the cross-examination now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At once, My Lord.
</line>
<hr />

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on what I witnessed that night.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>Thinking back now, I realise that I never actually saw the Professor at all, though.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>What I in fact witnessed, was a fellow graverobber at work.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
An embellishment?
</line><line>Drebber:
As I explained earlier, <textEffects>most</textEffects> of what the papers published about those events was fabricated nonsense. The journalists had a great time fashioning it into a horrifying ghost story.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So...now you're saying there was no gunshot?
</line><line>Drebber:
<textEffects>That's right</textEffects>, yes. I'm afraid so.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Drebber:
I <textEffects>mistakenly</textEffects> thought I'd seen a corpse coming back to life and then fled the scene. That's really all that happened.
</line>

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>There was no gunshot from behind me at all. Nor any splattering blood.</textEffects>

<line>Drebber:
<textEffects>Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all because of that newspaper article.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What's Drebber up to? Why would he suddenly change his tune and recant his claim?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I wonder if perhaps...it's because his circumstances have changed now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What circumstances?
</line><line>Susato:
Well...if he admits to having seen the Professor emerging alive from his grave ten years ago... ...it will expose a secret in Dr Sithe's past that she would desperately want to hide.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course! If Drebber and Dr Sithe are working together now... ...then if Drebber were to betray her, there would be no reason for her to continue to cooperate. <textEffects>(In that case, there's only one way around it. I'll have to prove he really did see it. Prove he really did see the Professor's corpse coming back from the dead as he originally claimed!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, Mr Naruhodo! Exactly!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber, do you remember this camera?
</line><line>Drebber:
...!
</line><line>Tusspells:
But...that is the camera from that fateful night!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, we...borrowed it from the House of Horrors. It's the camera you took with you to the cemetery that night, Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... And...is that supposed to be <textEffects>significant</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
This kind of camera is rarely seen in our homeland, so my colleague and I were keen to examine it closely. We noticed that the lens extends forwards on the end of some bellows... ...like this.

</line><line>Van Zieks:
What's that? There...just on the bellows... It looks like...a dark red <textEffects>stain</textEffects>...
</line><line>Drebber:
<textEffects>Ah</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. It's a rather conspicuous mark here on the bellows, in fact.
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord! Are you suggesting...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. It would appear to be a spatter of <textEffects>blood</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
Something that could be confirmed with a simple chemical test. Isn't that right, Dr Sithe?
</line><line>Sithe:
...! It would be difficult to determine if it was human blood and not the blood of some animal. But yes, to test whether or not it's blood at all is simple enough.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I propose that Madame Tusspells's testimony was correct. And that on the night in question ten years ago...you were spattered with blood from the gunshot wound.
</line><line>Drebber:
Well I...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that furthermore...you really did witness the condemned Professor emerging from his tomb!
</line><line>Drebber:
Grrr... Gaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's simply no way you could have forgotten such a traumatic experience! In other words, the only explanation... ...is that you're trying to hide the fact that you saw the Professor that night!

But why?! Why would he want to do that?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...not for his own gain, it would seem.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
For whose, then? Who could benefit?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber is obviously lying in order to protect somebody.
</line><line>Judge:
My goodness! He's shielding someone?
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. And clearly... ...it's someone who doesn't want the truth about the Professor 'coming back to life' to be exposed!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Counsel, who is it then? <textEffects>Who is this witness trying to protect by lying about what he saw that night?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The obvious answer...is Dr Sithe!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Sithe...?
</line><line>Judge:
What, whatever do you mean?
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Imagine if the convict who'd been sentenced to death was not in fact killed... Imagine if that was to come to light...
</line><line>Sithe:
What are you insinuating?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And imagine if the convict in question was the country's most hated mass murderer... ...if it was the Professor...
</line><line>Judge:
That, that would be an unprecedented scandal!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But the fact is...there was a witness to the fact that the man did escape his hanging!
</line><line>Judge:
If that were really true, Counsel, the implications of misconduct would not stop at the supervising coroner. It would taint the honour of the entire judiciary, from the ground up!
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it's exactly because of those monumental repercussions... ...that Dr Sithe would consent to any demand made of her by someone who threatened to expose the secret. Even if that meant being complicit in a crime.
</line><line>Judge:
You, you mean...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I mean that Dr Sithe wasn't collaborating in Mr Drebber's wicked scheme... ...she was <textEffects>coerced</textEffects> into collaborating! In order to protect her decade-old secret... ...she switched the dead body of Mr Asman with the waxwork model and fabricated the autopsy report!
</line><line>Sithe:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
L-Lord van Zieks!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Pray forgive my freshly filled hallowed chalice...and a whole raft of other discourtesies now.
</line><line>Judge:
Goodness me!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's just the sort of tall tale Londoners would enjoy, I grant you. An executed killer rising from the dead... A Scotland Yard cover-up... A conspiracy at the highest levels... So let me ask you one thing...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What's that?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If the condemned man really did emerge from his tomb that night only to be shot in the chest... ...who pulled the trigger and disposed of him forever?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Uh, well... <textEffects>(I have no idea at the moment!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
We have too little information to work that out at present, I think.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I couldn't agree more...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The Old Bailey is no place for wild fantasies.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And have you considered this, my learned Nipponese friend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Considered what?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Do you realise just what a <textEffects>dangerous</textEffects> endeavour it would be to coerce this woman into such criminal activity? It's tantamount to declaring war on the entire British police force and judiciary.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Quite. Hard to imagine any sum of money being offered for research could warrant it.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
To rely on some stage deception when so much is at stake would be madness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, well I suppose...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And this was no petty crime, either. The victim was murdered. A man who'd already invested money in the venture, and would be instrumental in future profits, too.
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, I had <textEffects>no reason</textEffects> to kill Mr Asman at all. Or are you forgetting that his death results in me receiving <textEffects>not a single penny</textEffects>? The court is <textEffects>already aware</textEffects> of the contract between myself and the victim, no?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... There is the contract, that's very true...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(The motive for this case runs deep, though. I can feel it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Using threats to force the head of the Forensic Investigation Team to cooperate is extreme. Especially for a government grant he had no guarantee of receiving in the first place.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...If the research grant was the aim, taking Mr Asman's life would have made no sense anyway. Which means... ...Mr Drebber's motive wasn't money at all. He was...just trying to kill Mr Asman! <textEffects>(But why? What WAS his motive, then?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Your time is up, my learned friend. I'd say you have one last chance before the jury lose their patience with this charade.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let's see if you can back up your heady proposal, shall we? How do you explain why this engineer would throw all caution to the wind and threaten his own country?
</line><line>Judge:
At this point, I'm not prepared to listen to more of this outlandish conjecture without proof. So, Counsel...present your evidence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Alright... Who exactly was Mr Asman to Drebber? There's <span style="color:#E16935">a connection</textEffects> there that no one's seen yet. And I'm going to have to present <textEffects>two</textEffects> pieces of evidence to show what it is.)</span> Yes, My Lord. <textEffects>The evidence that establishes a motive and explains why the witness wanted the victim dead is right here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
It's this newspaper article, My Lord.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
That was written ten years ago...and every detail has been examined already. What can it possibly tell us?
</line><line>Drebber:
That drivel should never have been written! It's typical gutter press nonsense that means nothing!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But there's something significant that this newspaper article and the contract <textEffects>have in common</textEffects>.
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Really?"
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>


<line>Ryunosuke:
It's this contract, My Lord. Mr Drebber, this is the contract you signed with Mr Asman.
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, <textEffects>that's right</textEffects>. The very document, in fact... ...that proves I had <textEffects>no reason to kill the man</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, I'm afraid not.
</line><line>Drebber:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's something very significant that this newspaper article and the contract <textEffects>have in common</textEffects>.
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Really?"
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Judge:
Really?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it's that common link... ...that shows very clearly why you were determined to kill Mr Odie Asman!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It seems the defence has uncovered something the rest of us have missed. So, my learned friend...point out what these two pieces of evidence have in common. <textEffects>Where exactly is the link between this newspaper article and the contract?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
What these two pieces of evidence have in common... ...is a signature.
</line><line>Judge:
A, a signature?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The signature on the illustration that accompanies the ten-year-old article and the signature on the contract... ...belong to <textEffects>the same person</textEffects>!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?!
</line><line>Drebber:
Agh...............
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As the court has heard, this illustration was drawn ten years ago... ...by the newspaper reporter who found Mr Drebber and interviewed him about his ordeal. If you look closely, the reporter's signature can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the drawing.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And if you look at the contract here, which was signed between the witness and the victim last year... ...you can clearly see Mr Asman's signature at the bottom.
</line><line>Judge:
Let me see now... Good Lord, yes! They're identical!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In short... ...the journalist who drew the illustration and wrote the article published about Mr Drebber ten years ago... ...was the victim of this case...Mr Odie Asman!
</line><line>Drebber:
Ugh... URAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But explain to the court why! Why would that constitute a motive for the witness to murder Asman?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, if you think back... ...you'll remember that Mr Drebber talked about that article in his testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
G-Graverobbing, you say?!
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses <textEffects>to sell</textEffects> is reasonably lucrative.
</line><line>Judge:
That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, well...I think <textEffects>I suffered</textEffects> retribution enough. <textEffects>The Daily Circus</textEffects>...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to <textEffects>leave the university</textEffects>. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me <textEffects>unambiguously</textEffects>, I might add.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Drebber:
Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all <textEffects>because of</textEffects> that newspaper article.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At the time, you were a student of the University of London who dreamt of becoming a scientist. However... ...this single newspaper article changed your entire life.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
So Mr Asman used to be a newspaper journalist, did he?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
He did, My Lord. In fact, it's a widely held belief that Asman managed to position himself at the heart of his criminal network... ...thanks to the many dubious connections he made during his time as reporter.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you had to give up on your dream and leave university. You lost everything. Eventually you found yourself working in the field of science, but only in the shadows. And all because of that article...written by Mr Asman!
</line><line>Drebber:
ENOUGH! ......... Stop this endless drivel about my life!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
</line><line>Judge:
Explain yourself, Mr Drebber!
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, it's true. I had to leave the university as a result of that article. But it was just the straw that broke the camel's back.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Drebber:
Almost every student of science in the faculty was too poor to actually conduct any research. But they struggled on with their hypotheses anyway. We all did. Only to have them taken by vultures. Sooner or later, you knew your ideas would be stolen and patented by some wretch or other, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious...
</line><line>Drebber:
Making a name for yourself as a scientist in a climate like that... ...was a miracle only a select few geniuses could ever hope to achieve. Personally, I wasn't one of those geniuses. So it was hardly a wrench. Being forced out of the university because of Lowgate was the best thing that could have happened to me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber... ...do you genuinely believe that?
</line><line>Drebber:
Of course I do! Who's better placed to know whether or not I possess a talent for science than me?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry to say...that your words don't ring true at all.
</line><line>Drebber:
...How dare you?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I have evidence to prove it.
</line><line>Drebber:
How are you in a position to say anything about me? I don't know you from Adam! Fine, if you think you have evidence, go ahead. Show it! <textEffects>What could you possibly have to disprove the idea that I was happy to leave university because I lacked talent?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Do you remember this, Mr Drebber? We found it at your workshop.
</line><line>Drebber:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I-Is that...a Royal Society trophy for excellence in science?
</line><line>Judge:
...What exactly is this trophy, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's the greatest honour that can be bestowed on a young scientist, My Lord.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
There is no higher accolade. It recognises emerging talent and promises a bright future.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your prospects for the future were excellent, weren't they, Mr Drebber? Because even then, you were a genius in your field.
</line><line>Drebber:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But you lost everything. You had no more future. Your talents would go to waste. All as a result of this one newspaper article.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't know when you realised who Mr Asman was. But when it dawned on you that he was the same journalist who ten years ago ruined your life... ...it's abundantly clear...that you had no intention of forgiving the man!
</line><line>Drebber:
......... .................. The truth...is...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Finally, he's going to fold.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Sithe:
Haaah... Fine. Clearly this has run its course now.
</line><line>Drebber:
What?!
</line><line>Sithe:
I admit it. All of it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Drebber:
W-What are you doing?!
</line><line>Sithe:
It's exactly as the Japanese man said. I was coerced into going along with this man's plot to murder the victim. On the condition that he kept my dirty secret from ten years ago.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No...
</line><line>Judge:
GOOD LOOOOOOOOORD!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Dr Sithe! Do you realise what you're saying, woman?!
</line><line>Sithe:
......... It's all true. That day... ...when I arrived at the Crystal Tower and saw the birdcage... ...my heart nearly stopped beating. That memory from a decade ago that I'd done my best to bury deep inside myself... It was the Professor again, staring me in the face. And then, before I had a chance to react, I noticed something else. There was a note tucked inside the model's jacket.
</line><line>'Dr Sithe, You will go along with my plan. From someone who knows the truth about what really happened that night ten years ago.'
.........
</line><line>Sithe:
All the instructions were there in the note. Every detail was meticulously written out. I had no choice but to do what it said. I made the necessary 'alterations' to the scene and fabricated the autopsy report as instructed. There was really no other choice. It had to be done to protect the judiciary. ...I can only apologise now.
</line><line>Drebber:
Why on earth would you buckle now?
</line><line>Sithe:
......... Well there's no point trying to hide it any more, is there? I would have done anything to stop it coming out. Even collaborate in a murder. But the great lie about that execution ten years ago has been exposed. Whatever happens...I'm finished.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So then, Mr Drebber, what do you say to that? Your accomplice has admitted everything.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... Surely it goes without saying.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You admit your part in it too, then?
</line><line>Drebber:
I admit nothing! At all!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Drebber:
Have you forgotten that the kinesis machine was ripped to shreds by an explosion? Short of me admitting to a crime, there's really no possible way for you to prove I did anything wrong.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Nnn...NOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
</line><line>Sithe:
Whatever this man says, I admit everything. He threatened to expose my secret, so I went along with his plan. And Lord van Zieks...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes?
</line><line>Sithe:
I hope you'll accept my apologies. ...What happens next is in your hands, of course.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
I have heard more than enough now. I hereby present the final findings of this court.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
This trial is not the proper forum in which to pursue the alleged wrongdoings of Mr Drebber. The defendant is Professor Albert Harebrayne.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Very true. It had slipped my mind.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Isn't he one of your closest friends?
</line><line>Judge:
As the court has heard, Dr Sithe has admitted to the allegations brought by the defence... ...thereby absolving the defendant of any possible guilt.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! You, you mean...
</line><line>Judge:
At the present time, it is the conclusion of this court that the defendant was <textEffects>not involved</textEffects> in any wrongdoing. Does the prosecution have any objection?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... ...None, My Lord.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo! You've proven Professor Harebrayne's innocence!
</line><line>Judge:
Without further ado then, the adjudication. Unless the prosecution or defence have any other matters to discuss?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(I don't know... This doesn't feel quite right. Why did Dr Sithe suddenly admit to it like that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Is everything alright, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Like you said before, the way the trial is set to end now... ...the judge will certainly deliver a verdict of not guilty. <textEffects>(But is that really what we want? What the defence should be pushing for now is...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The defence objects to the trial ending at this time, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We demand...one final testimony!
</line><line>Judge:
WHAT?! You do realise I'm about to adjudicate in favour of your client, I presume?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What are you playing at now, my Nipponese friend? Why would you want to obstruct the conclusion of the trial at this point? No defence lawyer in his right mind would do that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, what exactly are you thinking?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The truth - the whole truth - and a way to bring it all out into the open.
</line><line>Susato:
Right!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(Yes, in hindsight...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sholmes:
Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...I'm sure Mr Sholmes knew. He must have deduced that this would happen.)</textEffects> Yes, I'm here in court to advocate for my client. And to secure an acquittal.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Obviously.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But that's not all. I believe that I have a duty to the court... ...to pursue the whole truth of the case until every last detail is laid bare!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that is why the defence calls for further testimony from Dr Sithe.
</line><line>Sithe:
Testimony from me? About what?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
About the nature of your collaboration with Mr Enoch Drebber!
</line><line>Sithe:
Hah! In case it's escaped your attention, I've already admitted to everything I did. The whole truth has already been revealed. So stop wasting everyone's time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Sithe:
As His Lordship made very plain, your client will get the acquittal you wanted for him. There's simply no point protracting this business further with another tedious cross-examination.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Pray forgive my careless handling of that hallowed bottle. I slipped.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That's what you call it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
W-What is your objection, Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution... ...also calls for supplementary testimony from the witness.
</line><line>Sithe:
Don't be stupid!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If there is more to this case than has yet come to light... ...then I will join my learned friend in pursuing the facts until the bitter end.
</line><line>Sithe:
You'll what...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks...
</line><line>Judge:
This is most irregular, to say the least. However, as the prosecution also calls for it, I will uphold the request. Dr Sithe, you will testify for the court... ...explaining the full extent of your involvement in the murder apparently committed by Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Sithe:
I... ...Very well.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Waxwork Plot -</textEffects></captions>
<line>Sithe:
It all began at the scene when I saw the waxwork and the note tucked inside its jacket.
The actual body of the victim, as indicated in the note's instructions, was beneath the experimentation stage.
The body had to be 'arranged' in certain ways to implicate the defendant...which was my job.
I enlisted the help of the entire Forensic Investigation Team to dress the scene appropriately.
The truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret of the highest level. I had to protect it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
So I was right: the stage and the machine were all specially designed for the deception.
</line><line>Sithe:
So it seems. And all meticulously prepared. You did well to see through it. You're a very shrewd boy.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So kind of you to say...
</line><line>Susato:
And what about this autopsy report, then?
</line><line>Sithe:
All I did was record the location of the body as being in the Crystal Tower instead of under the stage.
</line><line>Susato:
That's all...? That's a terrible corruption!
</line><line>Sithe:
Only my team were aware of the deceit, and then only under my explicit instructions. Nobody else at Scotland Yard knew anything about it, I assure you.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm...we must be thankful for small mercies, I suppose. Well, I believe that testimony has clarified everything. There's no particular need for a cross-examination, I would say...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(No, I disagree. I can't shake the feeling that something's wrong. Just look at that expression on Dr Sithe's face.)</textEffects> It's the defence's right to cross-examine any witness following testimony!
</line><line>Sithe:
Tsk! What is it about you Japanese that makes you all so doggedly persistent?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. If you so desire, Counsel, proceed with the cross-examination!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!

<textEffects>The actual body of the victim, as indicated in the note's instructions, was beneath the experimentation stage.</textEffects>

<textEffects>The body had to be 'arranged' in certain ways to implicate the defendant...which was my job.</textEffects>

<line>Sithe:
<textEffects>The actual cause of death was the neck trauma Asman suffered from the thirty-foot fall.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sithe:
<textEffects>I stood over the victim's corpse where it lay in the toppled cage and plunged the screwdriver into the chest.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Sithe:
<textEffects>I enlisted the help of the entire Forensic Investigation Team to dress the scene appropriately.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sithe:
<textEffects>The truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret of the highest level. I had to protect it.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So that's her story...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
She's admitted everything and revealed her full involvement in the crime. I do wonder if there could really be much more to it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, I don't know. But...I just have a feeling.
</line><line>Susato:
Do you, Mr Naruhodo? The truth is, I find it strange, too. How those two are reacting to this in completely opposite ways, I mean.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, exactly. <textEffects>(For some reason, I feel sure they're still trying to hide something...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(I've got a nasty feeling... ...that this inconsistency points to an extremely uncomfortable truth!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What on earth is the matter, Counsel? Have you lost your tongue?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I apologise, My Lord. Dr Sithe, in that last statement of yours, there's just one point... ...that seems to defy explanation.
</line><line>Sithe:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Out with it, my learned friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's an obvious inconsistency between your description and this photograph... ...which shows the victim in the birdcage following the events that led to his death.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

The court has already examined that photograph in depth. There's nothing new we can learn from it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, we have already considered it, that's true. But we now know the facts to be different!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we should let the defence explain. <textEffects>Where in this photograph would we see the alleged inconsistency with the witness's statement?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Look closely at <textEffects>the bloodstain</textEffects> on the victim's chest. It clearly extends in a <textEffects>downwards</textEffects> direction, towards the man's feet.
</line><line>Judge:
And why is that significant, Counsel? If the victim was stabbed moments before the kinesis machine was set in motion, that's entirely expected... Aaaah! Of course, no, that's not what happened!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly, My Lord. Dr Sithe made it very clear in her testimony just now... ...that the point at which she stole Professor Harebrayne's screwdriver and stabbed the victim... ...was <textEffects>after</textEffects> the grand deception was set in motion, when the birdcage had fallen below the stage out of sight. From the shape of it, it's clear that the birdcage would have <textEffects>fallen on its side</textEffects> after the thirty-foot drop. And if the victim had really been stabbed whilst inside the birdcage in that position... ...the blood from the wound would have spread out equally in all directions. For it to have formed the longitudinal appearance we see in the picture...is inconceivable!
</line><line>Sithe:
......... Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Given that the victim's blood seeped vertically downwards from the wound... ...it must be the case that when you stabbed Mr Asman... he was <textEffects>standing</textEffects> up. In short, Dr Sithe... ...your latest testimony was a total fabrication!
</line><line>Sithe:
Agh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I knew it. I was right. Now I've identified that contradiction, there's only one way to explain the facts.)</textEffects> We've all been under a great misapprehension here.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?! What sort of misapprehension?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Dr Sithe...
</line><line>Sithe:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You claim you were coerced into helping Mr Drebber as a result of the note he left in the waxwork. You claim that you made changes to the scene of the crime to implicate the defendant. And you claim that you authored a fake autopsy report to cover your tracks. But one of those claims is an out-and-out <textEffects>lie</textEffects>! Because the question of what the bloodstain really tells us...has only one possible answer!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
If that is the case...what is it, man?!
</line><line>Judge:
Counsel, you've clearly struck upon a revelation. Now tell the court what it is! <textEffects>Which part of Dr Sithe's story is shown to be a lie by the contradiction in her testimony?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
The answer is very simple if you consider the sequence of events. If, when the victim was stabbed, the blood from the wound seeped downwards, as it did... ...we can be sure that the victim must have been either <textEffects>sitting or standing upright</textEffects> at the time.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But as you rightly pointed out, the birdcage would have fallen on its side when it fell beneath the stage.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it would. Which tells us... ...that the victim must have been in that position <textEffects>of his own accord</textEffects>.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
That's impossible! The man was dead, remember?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! That is the misapprehension! When the birdcage fell from the stage into the void below, it must have hit the ground with considerable force.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">But Mr Asman <textEffects>didn't die</textEffects> in the fall. He probably lost consciousness for a while, but when he came round, he got to his feet to climb out of the cage... ...just as Dr Sithe appeared.</captions>
<line>
Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If the victim was in fact <textEffects>alive</textEffects> at that point in time... ...it changes everything.
</line><line>Drebber:
Ah.........AAAAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Odie Asman's killer wasn't the defendant, Professor Albert Harebrayne. Nor was it the mastermind behind the stage trickery, Mr Enoch Drebber. It was you...Dr Courtney Sithe!
</line><line>Sithe:
Grrr......... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Can, can this possibly be true?
</line><line>Drebber:
Have you been taking me for a fool?! It was you, was it? You killed him?
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You hoped that by admitting to being an accomplice in Mr Drebber's scheme, the trial would end... ...before you were accused of a far worse crime: Cold-blooded murder!
</line><line>Sithe:
Oh do shut up! You're so desperate now, you're making all this up! As if I would do something like that!
</line><line>Susato:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Susato:
I assure you the defence is not desperate, Doctor! Mr Naruhodo has established the facts using evidence and logic alone!
</line><line>Sithe:
Hah! Logic? Don't make me laugh. Sadly your 'logic' has a gaping hole in it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...? What do you mean?
</line><line>Sithe:
Tsk! I'd have thought it was obvious. A motive, boy. You're lacking a motive. What possible reason would I have to kill Mr Asman?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Asman was involved in any number of criminal activities, from coercion to theft to murder... But there is no known connection to Dr Sithe there.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... I'm rather relieved to say it does seem somewhat far-fetched.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(True, there's no obvious motive. But there's still something in the back of my mind. I feel sure I've <span style="color:#E16935">seen</textEffects> something somewhere that hints at why the coroner might have done this...)</span>
</line><line>Sithe:
Yes, I might have tampered with the crime scene and concocted a fake report. But murdering someone for no reason is a very different story!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... No, when you questioned what possible reason you could have for wanting to kill Mr Asman... ...something did come to mind.
</line><line>Sithe:
What?
</line><line>Judge:
What was it, Counsel? Enlighten the court at once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, we saw it yesterday, didn't we? Something that seemed strange, but we had no reason to suspect it at the time...)</textEffects> <textEffects>There's a particular object that explains why Dr Sithe would have wanted to kill Mr Asman!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Judge:
Did you say 'scalpels'?!
</line><line>Sithe:
...Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It would appear that word has struck a chord, Doctor.
</line><line>Sithe:
You... Come on, out with it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was yesterday, when we visited your laboratory...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Look at this big thick book here.
</line><line>Susato:
Ah, it appears to be an accounting ledger. It's a record of the Forensic Investigation Team's spending, I think. ......... Oh...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What is it?
</line><line>Susato:
It's clear that the team purchases various equipment and supplies on a monthly basis, but... Well, one entry seems rather strange.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really? In what way?
</line><line>Susato:
They're buying five hundred scalpels every month!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Five hundred scalpels...a month?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At first, I wondered what on earth you could be using that many scalpels for. But actually, I realise now it's not the scalpels themselves that are significant. It's the money for them...disappearing every month from the department's accounts!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Asman's criminal organisation relied heavily on extortion for its funding. Tracing the money from the Forensic Investigation Team's account to find out where it was going... ...would be extremely straightforward.
</line><line>Sithe:
Ugh...uuugh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ten years ago, when Mr Asman was still a journalist and wrote this article about Mr Drebber... ...he may well have stumbled upon information as he was researching the story. Information relating to Dr Sithe's darkest secret that he would use to rack money from her for the next decade.
</line><line>Judge:
Her darkest secret? Good Lord! You mean...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't know what happened on the night of that execution ten years ago... ...but clearly the opportunity to rid yourself of that menace was too tempting to pass up.
</line><line>Sithe:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So in the end, you weren't coerced at all, were you? You did it entirely of your own free will. You stabbed Mr Asman in the heart with all your might... ...to silence the blackmailer who knew your dark secret forever!
</line><line>Sithe:
You'll never understand! None of you! What we've had to keep covered up all these long years...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
As very little of the machine remains after it was ripped apart by the bomb... ...the truth of this case can never be properly established unless you speak out.
</line><line>Susato:
And if you decide not to... ...it's very possible that Courtney Sithe will escape punishment for her crimes. Please, sir...own up to what you've done and tell the court the truth about what happened!
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Ten years ago you told the truth...and you were robbed of a bright and successful future as a result. I can certainly understand your bitterness...and your consternation now. However... ...this is surely the chance you've been waiting for...to sever the hold that fate's had over you all these years.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... Super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis? I mean, really...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Drebber:
......... It's the addle-brained mock scientists that are the worst, you know. They don't recognise the fact that they don't have talent. They can't even get that right. And so they end up chasing impossible dreams, having unbridled faith in their abilities. They go on and on about their wonderful hypotheses, their stupid eyes shining like a little child's. They make me sick! I can't abide their foolishness!
</line><line>Judge:
Careful, Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... I was particularly pleased with the kinesis machine. It made for quite a show, didn't it?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you admit it? You admit that it was nothing more than a sham made for the purpose of killing the victim?
</line><line>Drebber:
Yes, I admit it. I did it all...in the name of revenge.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Revenge for the future that Mr Asman's article had deprived you of ten years earlier. But the revenge you sought didn't stop at Asman, did it?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Which is where that very particular waxwork comes in. Yes, I see...
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
The condemned convict that you saw rising from the grave in Lowgate Cemetery ten years ago... If your account of those events was all true...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Then obviously Scotland Yard couldn't afford to acknowledge what had happened. Even if it meant discrediting a bright young man and crushing any future career he might have had.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So your plan required that you abduct that particular waxwork model... ...in order to exact your revenge on Scotland Yard as well. Or on Dr Sithe, to be precise.
</line><line>Drebber:
......... It was a year ago... By some extraordinary twist of fate, Asman turned up at my workshop. He didn't remember who I was, of course. He just wanted to employ my services as an engineer. And he happened to have a paper with him. An article on the front page caught my eye. About the coroner who'd handled that bogus autopsy being appointed head of a new forensic team. ...When I learnt that news...my cognitive processes started to devise the plan.
</line><line>Susato:
What a horrid tale...
</line><line>Drebber:
He robbed me of my future, so I wanted to use the man's own wiles against him...for revenge. And have that rotten Scotland Yard eating out of my hand at the same time. I wanted them all to suffer the same humiliation I'd had to suffer!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your actions against those who'd ruined your future were justified as revenge. At least, to yourself. Certainly, no one has the right to destroy another's prospects, especially for purely selfish gain. And yet... ...in carrying out your plan, you did exactly that to someone else, didn't you?
</line><line>Drebber:
Did I...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Professor Harebrayne's only crime was passion for his hypothesis! But you had no compunction about sacrificing his future to effect your revenge. You knew that he would be forever branded a failure and a fraud.
</line><line>Drebber:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Perhaps life treated you unfairly ten years ago, and others' misconduct left your life in tatters. But remember this... ...your own actions...resulted in exactly the same thing for another perfectly innocent young man!
</line><line>Drebber:
......... I... I... .........
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Lord van Zieks, what of Dr Sithe?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
An immediate warrant for her arrest has been granted and she's been remanded in custody, My Lord. I presume she will face trial in the coming days, along with Mr Drebber.
</line><line>Judge:
......... A most regrettable situation indeed... She's made great contributions to her profession over the years. It really is a hard truth to swallow. However...that is a topic for some future occasion. For now, Professor Harebrayne...
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Oh, um...yes?
</line><line>Judge:
It seems there was a great deal more to your experiment than you realised. However, I think we can assume now that all the sordid details have been brought to light. This has been a very long and profound trial, but I'm pleased to say...you are absolved of all guilt.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... This whole experience has taught me a very great but painful lesson. I've, I've been... I mean, me, this dedicated scientist... This, this devotee of natural philosophy... I've been selfish and self-centred and above all...a fool.
</line><line>Ryunosuke;
Professor...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Harebrayne:
I've spent my life thinking of nothing but my research. Misguidedly believing that I could do whatever I set my mind to, despite my lack of talent. And the worst of it is, in the process, I've caused others pain and misery! Others who are far, far greater people than I...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No, Professor, that's not true.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Wha...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Don't tar yourself with the same brush as Drebber. What happened was his doing and his alone. This outcome is his fate, not yours. ...You're not to blame in any way.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And the derision with which he referred to you earlier... Calling you a fool... Talentless, even...
</line><line>Harebrayne:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The man has no idea. To believe in yourself and work your fingers to the bone to realise your dreams... That's laudable, not laughable. No one has the right to deride another for such choices.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Oh... Thank you, Barok.
</line><line>Judge:
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Yes, My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
It is this court's expectation that you find the defendant not guilty of the charge of which he stands accused. I presume there are no objections?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
None from me, My Lord.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Certainly not.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
This trial has really made me think. But...this is the right decision.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
It's all been proven methodically and rigorously. I have no misgivings whatsoever.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Hm? What's that? Ee's done, is ee? It's all over?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
I don't know what's become of the Yard these days. I don't recognise the place.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. In that case, I hereby pronounce the defendant...

Professor! What a splendid outcome, isn't it?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, it is, it is! Congratulations, Professor Harebrayne!
</line><line>Harebrayne:
......... Mr Naruhodo... Miss Susato... I am truly...truuuly... ...beside myself with gratitude! How can I ever thank you enough?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm just glad it's all been cleared up. That you realise you were just caught up in a bad situation.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
AAAAAAH! Right now, you know...if I had that research grant money... AAAAAAH! I'd give the whole lot to you! Every penny!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...that's very kind, but...I'm just a student, so...
</line><line>Susato:
We don't need any financial reward. Your acquittal is more than enough.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Oh dear... Oh what can I do...? Aha! How about this? As a memento? The paper about my hypothesis is inside!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Well, just as a memento then. Thank you.
</line><line>Susato:
I've been wondering, Professor... ...what are you going to do now?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Oh, oh my... Yes... What am I going to do? My hypothesis and my great machine lie in ruins... But still, it's been too long since I was last in London, so perhaps I'll enjoy some sightseeing. I must explore the Great Exhibition whilst I'm here, too, and see if new inspiration hits me.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, that's a wonderful idea, I-

Ryunosuke:
L-Lord van Zieks! What are you doing in here?
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Barok!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I'm sorry you had to go through that, Albert.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Well, if I'm honest...it, it was terrifying! You were like a great demon behind your bench there, snarling down on your prey!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... You're one of the few true friends I have. I couldn't leave it to anybody else to handle the prosecution...or the defence.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? <textEffects>(Or <span style="color:#E16935">the defence</textEffects>? Did, did I just hear that right?)</span>
</line><line>Harebrayne:
I always knew that you had my best interests at heart, don't worry. Ah, how about you show me around while I'm here in town? It's been a long time since we left university. We have a lot to catch up on.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Listen, Albert... ...in a few days, your acquittal will be made official. When that happens... ...you must head straight to Dover. I'll accompany you.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
What?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
From there, you'll cross the Channel and make your way back to Germany. I've already purchased the tickets.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
But, but no! Hold on a minute, Barok! What about the Great Exhibition? This is the chance of a lifetime for me! I want to look around.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No, no sightseeing, Albert. Give up on the idea.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Ugh... S-Sometimes it's hard to see any warmth in those eyes, Barok...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, Lord van Zieks... ...what's all this about?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A necessary precaution.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, I...think I understand.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You do?
</line><line>Susato:
Well, Iris told me that when you met Lord van Zieks at his office some days ago... ...he asked how Mr Natsume was doing.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right! I remember being surprised at the time... and thinking it was nice of him to ask.
</line><line>Susato:
The point is...Mr Natsume is <textEffects>still alive</textEffects> and well! Even though it's been more than six months now since he stood trial with the Reaper as the prosecutor.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! You, you mean... ...the Reaper's influence doesn't stretch <textEffects>overseas</textEffects>?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Those in the Reaper's sights meet their ends days or sometimes months after their acquittal. That's been the pattern up to now.
</line><line>Susato:
But of course, we know that both Mr Natsume and Gina were completely innocent.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... True. And perhaps that governs the Reaper's actions. The truly <textEffects>innocent</textEffects> are <textEffects>spared</textEffects>. But I don't want to take any chances with a close personal friend.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
B-B-Barok...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Like the moustached Nipponese...this man should leave the country without delay. That's why...I'm packing him off to Germany at once!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
R-Right... <textEffects>(Does your friend-shaped package get any say in it...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Goodness! Was this your intention all along then, Lord van Zieks?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(In court, where people think of him as the Reaper, this man seems absolutely merciless...and yet... ...sometimes I feel as though I don't understand him at all.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It's time to go, Albert. Back to the prison for the time being.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Ah, yes, alright. Well then, Mr Naruhodo... ...thank you so much for everything!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Not at all, Professor! It was a pleasure getting to know you!
</line><line>Susato:
Best wishes, Professor Harebrayne.
</line><line>Harebrayne:
Well, once the dust has settled...you MUST come and visit me in Germany! Anyway, goodbye for now!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Now, my Nipponese friend...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes? <textEffects>(I thought you'd gone too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...we have matters to discuss. Can you spare me some time?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You want to talk with me?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I'll be waiting in the courtroom in ten minutes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well that was strange. For some reason I didn't get that sense of impending doom as he walked away this time. The enigma, Barok van Zieks... What does he want to discuss, I wonder? The answer awaits in the courtroom, I suppose. Here goes then...)</textEffects>

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>24th October, 4:58 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom</textEffects></captions>
<line>
Van Zieks:
So, are you satisfied? You saved a guileless scientist from a great injustice.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...yes! I think so. I'm relieved, at least, that the man's innocence could be proven.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Anyway... ...I imagine you've been wondering where my animosity towards you Nipponese comes from.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Well, at first I thought you just didn't like me. I imagined you saw me as a pretentious child from an unimportant land, who had no business being here. But now I think differently.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You clearly know our ways. So I would guess that some specific incident led to your thorough dislike of my race. Will you tell me what happened, please?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... The Professor... I thought I'd never hear that name in this courtroom again, to be honest.
</line><line>Susato:
He, he took your brother's life...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Klint. My brother was Klint van Zieks. Sixteen years ago, when I was still just in my teens... ...he was already the Director of Prosecutions, and a key member of the judiciary. I looked up to him. He was everything I aspired to be.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
He was involved in the establishment of justice systems in foreign countries, as well. There were exchange programmes between Britain and other nations then too, to share knowledge and ideas. As part of one of those programmes... ...three judicial students came to Britain from your homeland, the Empire of Japan.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! If it was sixteen years ago, then...one of them could have been my father...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Of course, I remember Doctor Mikotoba well.
</line><line>Susato:
I had no idea...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I was a minor at the time, training at the Prosecutor's Office. One day Klint introduced me to the three visiting Nipponese.
</line><line>Susato:
So...you've actually met my father...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
He and his colleagues were polite and amicable. They were adept at their work and exacting in their standards. It was my first encounter with the Nipponese spirit, and it made a very great impression upon me. But six years later... That's when it happened. The investigation was going nowhere. There were no suspects, even. Just an ever-growing list of victims. And in the end...my brother became one of them. The last in fact, before the case was finally resolved.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm so sorry, Lord van Zieks. Truly...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Klint was always ready to put his life on the line for justice anyway. So he wouldn't have wanted it any other way. He lost his life to the killer, but it was his victory in the end. For me personally, though, it was a great loss. I found myself in a very dark place indeed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
When I finally found out the killer's identity... ...the reason why no one had been able to catch the man sooner ceased to be such a mystery. He'd been <textEffects>hiding in plain sight</textEffects> all the time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In plain sight?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Are you aware of political events ten years ago? It was a period of extremely sensitive diplomacy between the British and Japanese empires.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A new treaty was being forged, I think?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Correct. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation was being concluded. The leaders of both countries were deep in extensive political discussions. Which is why this particular killer's appearance in court was conducted as a closed trial. If the British public had known the identity of the killer... ...not only would the treaty have been in jeopardy...but our two nations could very well have ended up at war.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! A, a war...between Britain and Japan?
</line><line>Susato:
But that would mean... Oh my! You mean to say the Professor was...

<captions aligned="center">When the trial reached its conclusion earlier, I thought to myself, 'Yes, it's time.' Time for you to come face to face with this hideous monster.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Eh?</captions>
<line>
Van Zieks:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">I borrowed the key for the mask from the proprietress of the waxwork museum. So see for yourselves now. Confirm it with your own eyes: the truth that's been hidden this past decade.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Th...That's the Professor?!</captions>
<line>
Van Zieks:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Yes...that's him.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...Until now...the thought never even crossed my mind... ...that the mass murderer whose crimes shook Britain as never before... ...was Japanese!</captions>
<line>
Susato:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">W-Wait a minute! That face... I feel as though...I've seen it somewhere... It's strangely familiar...</captions>
<line>
???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...!</captions>
<line>
???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Fa... Father...</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...! Wha...? 'Father'? Kazuma! <textEffects>(My best friend, Kazuma Asogi... After a whole year... finally, his memories returned... ...as he stood there before me...)</textEffects></captions>
<line>
Kazuma:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Ryunosuke...</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Hello again... ...my friend.</captions>
<line>
Susato:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Kazuma-sama!</captions>
<line>
Kazuma:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Judicial Assistant Mikotoba... ...it's been a very long road. Thank you. Thank you for guiding my friend here when I could not.</captions>
<line>
Susato:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">It...it was an honour.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">I knew you wouldn't die that easily, Kazuma.</captions>
<line>
Kazuma:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...I owe you thanks, too. ...for taking good care of that in my absence.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Hm? ...Oh! <textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Karuma</textEffects>, the great blade of the Asogi clan, passed down through the generations... When we left Japan, this sword was at my friend's side. A Japanese man's katana is his soul. And he couldn't be parted from it. But then, when the incident happened... ...it was Susato-san's wish that I inherit the sword. And I've kept it with me ever since...along with my memories of the friendship we shared.)</span> With this by my side, I always felt that you were watching over me somehow.</captions>
<line>
Kazuma:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">I've made it at last...Father.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Are you saying...? Surely not! You mean...y-you knew all this time?! <textEffects>(I'm looking at it, but I still can't believe it... This mass murderer...is Kazuma's father!)</textEffects></captions>
<line>
Susato:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">K-Kazuma-sama...</captions>
<line>
Kazuma:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">......... Ryunosuke... ...we have much to talk about, but now is not the time. ...I'll be seeing you.</captions>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">That's all Kazuma said... ...before he turned and left us there in the courtroom.</captions>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
So he's the living 'afterimage' of the man who took my brother's life, is he?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, Kazuma Asogi. My best friend.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Three months ago, when Lord Stronghart introduced us... ...I had an inkling there was something there. Some connection.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(But why did Lord Stronghart do that? Why did he make Kazuma Lord van Zieks's apprentice? And when he was suffering amnesia, too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The man was apprehended... Even executed... ...but his legacy just won't die. That's the sad truth. Anyway, that's all I had to say. I thank you for meeting with me as I asked.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Susato:
Ten years ago... ...my grandmother took me to the railway station. We were there to meet my father from the train. For me... ...it was the first time I'd ever seen him.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Poor Susato-san. All this is tied up with painful memories for her, too. She's never talked about this with me before, though...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">It took time to adjust to having Father around. But just when I was starting to get used to it... ...he called me into his study one day. He told me that a great friend of his had passed away in London. And that the friend had left behind a son. A boy, seven years my senior. Father told me the boy had made a promise to his late father... ...so he was studying to become a defence lawyer.</captions>
<line>I wanted to help, so... ...I studied to become a qualified judicial assistant. ......... As I'm sure you've worked out... ...that young man's name... ...was Kazuma Asogi. So you see...that's how he and I met.
</line>
<hr />
<line>For a brief moment, my great friend had returned... only to disappear again all too soon. But in that fleeting encounter, something stirred. Something that had been dormant for a long time. As if great wheels had been set in motion. I could almost hear them creaking into life. In some ways, it was the end of a chapter. But in many, it was the start of a new one.
