Long long ago, the Nine-Tailed Fox defeated the evil Tenma Taro, and sealed the fallen demon away. To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber.
</line><line>Man:
Night night, Alderman! Sweet dreams! At long last, the revival of Tenma Taro is at hand.

Apollo:
Hm.  Guess I'm a little early.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all!
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, aren't we all fired up!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details.
</line><line>Trucy:
Work? Is that how he put it?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.)</textEffects>
</line><line><br clear="all" />
</line>
<hr /><line><br clear="all" />
</line><line>Apollo:
My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the <textEffects>Wright Anything Agency</textEffects>, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- It's definitely a law agency.
</line><line>Trucy:
But don't forget that this place is a "talent agency" too, Polly!
</line><line>Apollo:
Uhh, it's the "law agency" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks.
</line><line>Trucy:
And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's "talents" as well!
</line><line>Apollo:
I was under the impression that I was a lawyer...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned?
</line><line>Trucy:
This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on!
</line><line>Apollo:
Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming.
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, this is the "Wright ANYTHING Agency," y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Tell me again why I chose to "work" here?)</textEffects> Where is Mr. Wright, anyway?
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait a second! <textEffects>(*sigh* And another day of "anything goes" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...)</textEffects>
</line>

<center><textEffects>April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane</textEffects></center>
<line>Apollo:
Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains?
</line><line>Trucy:
This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants?
</line><line>Trucy:
Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here!
</line><line>Apollo:
In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy.
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?!
</line><line>Apollo:
I could do without thoughtfulness like that.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Alright, I guess it's time to <span style="color:#E16935">move</textEffects> to the "Kyubi Manor's Garden"...)</span>

Apollo:
Wow, this place is really something.
</line><line>Trucy:
It definitely feels like a different world here.
</line><line>???:
Trucy.
</line><line>Trucy:
Jinxie!
</line><line>Apollo:
And this is?
</line><line>Trucy:
My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here.
</line><line>Jinxie:
...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon?
</line><line>Apollo:
No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eeeeeek! He IS a demon!
</line><line>Apollo:
What the--!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Be gone, foul beast!
</line><line>Trucy:
Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead!
</line><line>Apollo:
Argh... What is this thing?
</line><line>Trucy:
It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, but I'm not a monster.
</line><line>Trucy:
Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon.
</line><line>Apollo:
Or you could just say I'm human.
</line><line>Jinxie:
*shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I got up early to do my hair for this?)</textEffects> Um, can I take this off now?
</line><line>Jinxie:
So you can eat me?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm not going to eat you!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one!
</line><line>Trucy:
Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, don't worry. I'm already full.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Please stay that way.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Great, now I'm playing along, too.)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
Um, I wanted to show you this.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eek! What is it?!
</line><line>Apollo:
It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Really?! â€¦You're a lawyer?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment?
</line><line>Apollo:
Who's Enma Dai-O?
</line><line>Trucy:
I read somewhere that's <i>[sic]</i> he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly!
</line><line>Apollo:
Can I go back to being just a normal demon?!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul!
</line><line>Apollo:
Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! <textEffects>(Ack!)</textEffects> Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me.
</line><line>Trucy:
Isn't that great, Jinxie?!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them.
</line><line>Apollo:
Evil things?
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
It's time for me to get back to work.
</line><line>Trucy:
Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie!
</line><line>Jinxie:
You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a <textEffects>surprise event</textEffects> today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
.........Hm? .........Eeeeek!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ahhh! D-D-Demon! <textEffects>(Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
T-T-Tenma T-Taro!
</line><line>Apollo:
Tenma Taro? <textEffects>(The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone!
</line><line>Tenma Taro:
Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that "Die and Go To Heaven" charm?!
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time!
</line><line>Apollo:
...She sure gives up quick. <textEffects>(Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Villager:
Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? <textEffects>(Steal my soul? Seriously?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro!
</line><line>Apollo:
Now what?!
</line><line>Trucy:
Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof!
</line><line>???:
Ah-ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Villager:
That booming laugh! Could it be...!
</line><line>???:
My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land! I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Villager:
Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails!
</line><line>Wrestler:
Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch!
</line><line>Tenma Taro:
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Wrestler:
A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir!
</line><line>Wrestler:
Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor.
</line><line>Jinxie:
That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.)</textEffects> What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro?
</line><line>Jinxie:
That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me.
</line><line>Apollo:
She's a strange one, all right.
</line><line>Trucy:
I think she's sweet in own her <i>[sic]</i> special way.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are "sweet" in their own way.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here.
</line><line>Apollo:
The fun never stops, does it?

I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale.
</line><line>Apollo:
I know, because my wallet's running on empty.
</line><line>Trucy:
Hm? What's with all the commotion over there?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay.
</line><line>Jinxie:
I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--!
</line><line>Trucy:
Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Trucy:
Wait, killed as in dead?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Yes. And Tenma Taro did it!
</line><line>Apollo:
Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look.
</line><line>Jinxie:
P-Please, wait!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...? Ack!
</line><line>Jinxie:
It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase.

Who are you?
</line><line>Apollo:
Help! Someone call an ambulance!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital.

<line>Apollo:
Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious.
</line><line>Trucy:
You think Jinxie's going to be okay?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. <textEffects>(And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, look, here comes Jinxie.
</line><line>Jinxie:
...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer.
</line><line>Apollo:
Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened...

<line>Apollo:
Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I check it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy.
</line><line>Trucy:
Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! Maybe this is your chance.
</line><line>Apollo:
Chance for what?
</line><line>Trucy:
To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court!
</line><line>Apollo:
Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wha--?!
</line><line>Trucy:
You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.)</textEffects> ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me!
</line><line>Trucy:
Atta boy, Polly!
</line><line>Jinxie:
You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yep, because that's what lawyers do. <textEffects>(Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!)</textEffects> I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.)</textEffects> Ah, but before I forget... <textEffects>(Better jot this down in my notebook.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my <textEffects>Notes</textEffects> in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a "To-Do" list.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh? Sounds handy.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with R. Then I can switch between the tabs using L and R.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, what?
</line><line>Jinxie:
His angry glare can paralyze you with fear.
</line><line>Trucy:
And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done.
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, thanks.

</line><line>???:
...Who are you?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Yikes!)</textEffects> S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! <textEffects>(Lemme outta here!)</textEffects> S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes!
</line><line>Tenma:
How... incredibly... RUDE!
</line><line>Apollo:
Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you?
</line><line>Tenma:
A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tenma:
Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened?
</line><line>Tenma:
Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whew, that was close. We don't need "jailbreak" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma.
</line><line>Tenma:
Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?
</line><line>Tenma:
She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need.
</line><line>Apollo:
Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter!
</line><line>Tenma:
I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about.
</line><line>Apollo:
New... friends?
</line><line>Tenma:
Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tenma:
Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!)</textEffects> A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Apollo, is that you?</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Trucy told me you've taken on a new case.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. <textEffects>(He's actually calling ME about a case?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>That's fine, but I have a favor to ask.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure. What is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
But I've never even met her before. What does she look like?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>She'll be the girl in the <span style="color:#E16935">yellow suit</textEffects> sporting an attorney's badge.</span>
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... <textEffects>(Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.)</textEffects>

I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency.
</line><line>Athena:
The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name.
</line><line>Apollo:
...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I could say the same thing to you.)</textEffects> Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always.
</line><line>Athena:
.........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away!

</line><line>Apollo:
A special edition covering our case? That was quick.
</line><line>Athena: 
That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... Well, let's see what it says here... <textEffects>(What's the deal with the Spanish?)</textEffects> Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?!
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved.
</line><line>Athena:
Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you?

Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. <textEffects>(Now German? Why not plain old English?)</textEffects>

Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner.
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape.</textEffects>

So, that wrestler's gone missing.

Hey, you two! You don't belong in here!
</line><line>Athena:
Eek!

Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious--

What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me!

Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to--

Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh.

Um, same here.

Wow, talk about a quick change of heart.
</line><line>Filch:
So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you!
</line><line>Apollo:
Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone!
</line><line>Filch:
They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so...

<textEffects>(Talk about a quick escape.)</textEffects> ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer.
</line><line>Athena:
He left his shoes behind, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief.
</line><line>Athena:
Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them!

</line><line>Athena:
You mean the great evil has returned?
</line><line>Apollo:
Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him.
</line><line>???:
Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene!
</line><line>Apollo:
And who are YOU? Are you with the police?

I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene!

<textEffects>(Guess that about wraps it up.)</textEffects> Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows...
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something?
</line><line>Apollo:
Hm? .........I don't hear anything.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, what are you talking about?
</line><line>Athena:
A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... "In... In..."
</line><line>Fulbright:
IN JUSTICE WE TRUST!
</line><line>Athena:
Aaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct!
</line><line>Athena:
I heard it through the air ducts?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yeah, check it out.
</line><line>Apollo:
But why would she hear you through there?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears!
</line><line>Athena:
And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. 9 feet high, in fact. I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you?
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... I guess you're right.
</line><line>Apollo:
Speaking of things in this room...
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yeah?
</line><line>Apollo:
Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case!
</line><line>Apollo:
Aw, come on, throw us a bone here.
</line><line>Athena:
Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard!
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? "<textEffects>To serve and protect.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Yes, of course! I must serve and <i>[sic]</i> well as protect! Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice!
</line><line>Athena:
We did it, Apollo!

Yeah, we did it, all right. <textEffects>(But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Fulbright:
Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor.

The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial?

...Right. Well, thanks for your help. <textEffects>(So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.)</textEffects>
</line><line>L'Belle:
Come along, Filchy.
</line><line>Filch:
Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes!
</line><line>L'Belle:
You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday!
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(What does he mean, "practice statements"?)</textEffects>
</line><line>L'Belle:
Now if would excuse me. <i>[sic]</i> It's time to touch up my makeup.
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems <textEffects>unusually preoccupied</textEffects> with Tenma Taro.
</line><line>Apollo:
Really? How can you tell?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice.
</line><line>Apollo:
You mean you have good ears?
</line><line>Athena:
Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason.
</line><line>Apollo:
That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro?
</line><line>Athena:
I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... <textEffects>obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro</textEffects>... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway.
</line><line>Apollo:
Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm...
</line><line>Athena:
We should go talk to the mayor, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sounds like a plan. <textEffects>(We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.)</textEffects>

Athena:
Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, he's here!
</line><line>Tenma:
.........
</line><line>Athena:
It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro!
</line><line>Tenma:
Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...)</textEffects> Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free.
</line><line>Tenma:
What utter nonsense!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yikes!
</line><line>Tenma:
They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you!
</line><line>Athena:
A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What he really needs to work on are his people skills...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain "habit" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! All right, I've got him now. His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I've gotta pour <i>[sic] [recte</i> pore] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear. And when it does, I'll "Perceive" (X) it!
</line><line>Tenma:
Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism.
</line>

<line>Apollo:
Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.
</line><line>Tenma:
The truth? I don't understand.
</line><line>Apollo:
When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching.
</line><line>Tenma:
What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Please, tell us more about your merger bid.
</line><line>Tenma:
What more is there to tell?
</line><line>Apollo:
Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale?
</line><line>Tenma:
I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize.
</line><line>Apollo:
You really don't trust us, do you?
</line><line>Tenma:
What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not?
</line><line>Apollo:
I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this.
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then.
</line><line>Tenma:
Argh!
</line><line>Apollo:
So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh?
</line><line>Tenma:
W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh!

<line>Apollo:
Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.
</line><line>Tenma:
That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Apollo:
This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some <textEffects>white hair</textEffects> inside.
</line><line>Tenma:
White hair... you say?
</line><line>Apollo:
There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day.
</line><line>Tenma:
Wha... What are you saying!?
</line><line>Apollo:
You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself!
</line><line>Athena:
No way!
</line><line>Tenma:
The alderman was--! Impossible!
</line><line>Athena:
Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze.
</line><line>Athena:
Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene?
</line><line>Apollo:
There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift.
</line><line>Tenma:
This is absurd!
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you?
</line><line>Tenma:
Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished.
</line><line>Apollo:
The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.
</line><line>Guard:
Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over.
</line><line>Tenma:
It would appear this meeting is adjourned.
</line><line>Athena:
.........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer?
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters.
</line><line>Athena:
What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place!
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.)</textEffects> *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face.
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo? Are you all right?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! <textEffects>(I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.)</textEffects>
