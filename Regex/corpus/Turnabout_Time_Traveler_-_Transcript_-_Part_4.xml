</line><line>Phoenix:
Please tell me everything you can about when you got stabbed.
</line><line>Sorin:
After the reception, Ellen and I were enjoying a moment alone in the reception hall. Then Dumas appeared and stabbed me... He grabbed Ellen and the Time Keeper, and left the reception hall.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Did Mr. Gloomsbury say anything at that time?
</line><line>Sorin:
...I don't remember. After I was stabbed, I was immobilized by the pain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see.

<line>Sorin:
<textEffects>The next thing I saw was Ellen and Dumas on the vista deck.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sorin:
<textEffects>I knew Ellen was in danger, so I headed for the vista deck.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Sorin:
<textEffects>But when I got there, Dumas was already...</textEffects>

<line>Sorin:
<textEffects>I don't want to believe it, but it must've been Ellen. Nothing else makes sense...</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
That was some pretty damning testimony...
</line><line>Maya:
Saying that Ellen must've done it -- I don't believe that for a second!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't believe it either. Let's hope this cross-examination gives us some insight into what actually happened. But first, we'll have to find something to latch onto in his testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
As anyone can see from the hold entry record... ...there's absolutely no mention of Sorin Sprocket entering the hold!
</line><line>Sorin:
............!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense asserts that Mr. Sprocket used a different route to get to the vista deck!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can assert all you want, Mr. Wright... ...but can you actually prove another route exists?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Can I prove the existence of another route to the vista deck, you ask?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I can prove it! <textEffects>(Even if it's just a bluff, I have to present something... Anything that could prove the existence of a faster route to the vista deck!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, then, Mr. Wright. Show us how Mr. Sprocket got to the vista deck.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Mr. Sprocket made for the vista deck through here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
To save his bride from danger, Mr. Sprocket... ...opened the escape hatch and made his way along the outside wall to the vista deck! Isn't that right, Mr. Sprocket?
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That would certainly be a much faster route to the vista deck...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
*sigh* I'm disappointed, Mr. Wright. Is that really the best you could muster? That escape hatch is not meant to be used to get from the reception hall to the vista deck! One slip, and that's all it would take for Mr. Sprocket to plunge to his death!
</line><line>Judge:
I have to agree. The defense's claim is really stretching it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I understand how it sounds, Your Honor! But, at this point, it's too early to definitively say... ...that he didn't go that way!
</line><line>Judge:
So that's what you're going with then, I take it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Of course, Your Honor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is real life, Mr. Wright. Not some cinematic drivel or comic book! Do you have some sort of logical explanation to share that would convince us of your claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... I do.
</line><line>Maya:
Are you sure, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... kind of? <textEffects>(Actually, I have nothing... So I'll just have to wing it somehow!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
On what do you base your theory that Mr. Sprocket made his way along the outside?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>My theory that he was able to go along the outside wall despite the danger is based on...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
To save the bride he loves, the groom risked his life and rushed to her side. Mr. Sprocket was able to make it to the vista deck despite the danger... ...because of the power of love!
</line><line>Judge:
The power of love? ............ Hmm... That love is a source of strength that can help one overcome any obstacle... I think I can relate, thanks to my own long, happy marriage.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow. He actually seems to be buying it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The "power of love," you say? That kind of illogical argument is hardly viable in a court of law! Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid not, Mr. Edgeworth. You should never underestimate the power of love. You'll understand one day when you get marri--
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which I won't!
</line><line>Judge:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly what is so wrong with wishing to remain unwed?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Way to set him off, Your Honor...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Never mind all this unscientific nonsense! Are you aware, Mr. Wright, that at the time of the crime... ...there was a huge propeller turning at full speed between the hatch and the vista deck?! Even if a person were to go outside through the hatch... ...they'd be blown away in an instant!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Where does your "power of love" get you now, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Judge:
A huge spinning propeller, you say? Hmm... In that case, I have to admit it does seem impossible...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arngh! <textEffects>(I should've known...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
...Nick, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
......Right! <textEffects>(I feel like I just saw Mia looking out at me through Maya's eyes!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-What's wrong, Nick? Why are you gaping at me like a giant sunfish?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Maya! You just helped me remember something really important!
</line><line>Maya:
There it is! There's that fearless smile I was looking for! Now give us a mind-blowing theory, just like you always do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to turn my thinking around! Instead of wondering how Sorin could've moved past that huge propeller... ...I have to think about what would've made it possible for him to do so!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Mr. Wright only makes that ridiculous face when his back is pressed against the wall. Therefore, please do hurry and give your ruling before --
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. It's still far too early to discount my theory.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you talking about? The airship's large spinning propellers have already shredded it to pieces!
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But if we think a little more outside the box... ...I'm sure we can find a way he could've made it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Stop trying to stall, Mr. Wright! And show us how it could've been even remotely possible -- if at all!
</line><line>Judge:
I must agree with Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
V-Very well, Your Honor. <textEffects>(There must've been a way! Some way that Sorin could've moved along the wall in spite of the propeller!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, then, Mr. Wright. What specifically would've made it possible?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is how it would've been possible for Mr. Sprocket to get to the vista deck.</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
What allowed Mr. Sprocket to go along the outside wall in spite of the propellers... ...is the location of the Flying Chapel at the time of the crime!
</line><line>Judge:
The location of the Flying Chapel...? But wasn't it flying high in the sky?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor, I'm afraid it wasn't.
</line><line>Judge:
WHAT?! Th-Then where was it?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
At the time of the murder, the airship wasn't flying through the sky... But moored to the ground!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And if the airship wasn't flying, then that means... ...the propellers weren't turning!
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
In which case... ...Mr. Sprocket could have gotten to the vista deck along the outside wall! Isn't that right, Mr. Sprocket?!
</line><line>Sorin:
...Urk! ......I-I don't remember!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ow... He stabbed himself with his pencil. That's gonna leave a mark.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even if the propellers weren't turning, it would've been far too risky to go that way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, but, Mr. Edgeworth, you're forgetting about the power of love.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, the amazing power of love...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not this again...! V-Very well. For the sake of argument, let's assume this so-called "power of love"... ...made it possible for Mr. Sprocket to move along the outside wall of the airship. Can you prove that the airship was tied to the ground as you claim, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, well, I... <textEffects>(I don't have any evidence that proves where the airship was at the time...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can prove it, can't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urgh...! Maya... Can you think of anything we can use to prove it?
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... Can't say I can... Oh, wait! Didn't somebody see something outside a window at the time of the crime...? I think I remember someone saying as much...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have a piece of evidence that shows what was outside the airship?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, what are you waiting for?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the crime!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the murder!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What kind of lousy drawing is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a drawing made by Larry Butz!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. And what can you prove with that poor attempt at artistry?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Larry made this drawing before he switched the lanterns. So it must've been right around when the murder was being committed. Now, if I could direct the court's attention here!
</line><line>Judge:
I-Is that a pterodactyl?! Does that mean... that the airship actually went back in time to the Cretaceous Period...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We've already proven that time travel is nothing more than a gimmick, did we not?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
We did, and I have no intention of bringing up that argument again. But this drawing shows us an important piece of information. It shows us that the airship was actually moored on the ground!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...And what makes you so sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's easy. All you have to do is consider who made this drawing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Larry.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. It was Mr. Butz. And we both know what he's like. He must've seen something else and mistaken it for a pterodactyl.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... I can't argue with you there.
</line><line>Larry:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Larry:
H-Hey! Wait just one doggone second here! What kind of moron do you guys take me for?! I saw it with my own eyes! A pterodactyl flew right by the window, I tell you! I have the sharp eyes of an artist! Don't you believe me?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No.
</line><line>Larry:
Niiiick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope.
</line><line>Larry:
Some friends you guys are! What about the judge? You believe me, r-right, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you need to leave this courtroom. Bailiff, if you would.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Come on, buddy, let's go!
</line><line>Larry:
Why doesn't anybody believe meeeeeeeee?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Don't take it personally, Larry... I know you're just being... well, you...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem! Now, then... So you're saying that what Mr. Butz really saw... ...bears some relation to what was outside the airship at the time of the murder?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor! <textEffects>(At least, I think it does...)</textEffects> What this pterodactyl really is will prove the airship was anchored at the mooring dock! <textEffects>(It had better, anyway. If it doesn't, my whole argument is a bust!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
If you're that confident about it, then please go ahead and tell us what it really was.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Think, Phoenix! What could that pterodactyl have actually been?!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Please take a good look at this sign!
</line><line>Judge:
At the sign? Hmm... It appears to have been broken, and then repaired. But what does this sign have to do with the pterodactyl?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please focus on this part of the sign.
</line><line>Judge:
The part that broke off and got reattached? What about it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
How about if we turn it like this?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! Th-That shape! It's the pterodactyl in the drawing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What Mr. Butz actually saw was this chunk as it was being blown through the air by wind!
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, there were some heavy winds in the area of the mooring dock. But it's hard to imagine that this sign would make it up as high as an airship would fly. That means, the Flying Chapel must've been anchored at the mooring dock that night! Isn't that right... Mr. Sprocket?!
</line><line>Sorin:
Nngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's more than enough of this "power of love" nonsense, you pop culture junkie. Present all the proof you want, but your argument is based far too much in conjecture. Why don't we return to reality now?
</line><line>Phenix:
Wh-What do you mean "too much conjecture"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even if the airship wasn't flying, that alone doesn't prove the witness went along the wall.
</line><line>Judge:
True... Even now, it's no more than a possibility.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then how do YOU propose Mr. Sprocket got to the vista deck, Mr. Edgeworth?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I noticed something as I went over the evidence. Please take a look at this hold entry record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What about it? I don't see Mr. Sprocket listed on here anywhere!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't you remember? In yesterday's session, we had a very similar kind of argument.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Did we...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Honestly, Mr. Wright. Are you going senile already? We talked about Larry Butz using the defendant's key card to enter the hold.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... We did talk about that, didn't we...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In other words, even if a person's name isn't on the entry record... ...it's still possible for that person to have entered by using someone else's card!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Sprocket. You entered the hold with Mr. Nichody, didn't you?
</line><line>Sorin:
.......... ............I did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?!
</line><line>Sorin:
P-Pierce is indispensable. I didn't want to mention him unnecessarily, and risk having him wrongly accused. ...I couldn't do without him.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Sprocket, I ask that you testify in greater detail about your movements that night.

The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce.
That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record.
I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.

<textEffects>(Well, this doesn't help me one bit...)</textEffects>

Mr. Sprocket, you've concealed information from us time and time again. Who do you think you are, treating this court of law with such irreverence?!

............!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That being said, I do appreciate the testimony you gave just now.
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thanks to you, we now know why your name doesn't appear on the entry record. Now there are no more inconsistencies in the witness's testimony!

Arngh...!
</line><line>Maya:
That's Mr. Edgeworth for you! He never leaves a loose end dangling! You okay, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't exactly call this situation "okay"... Somehow I'll have to coax the information we need for an opening out of him. <textEffects>(If I even can, that is...)</textEffects>

That Sorin has too many secrets! I bet he's still hiding other things, too!

That's definitely a possibility. But in a situation like this, what we have to do is go back to the basics.

You mean go over the testimony and check for any lies or inconsistencies?

Mr. Sprocket, you just said your injury is a knife wound, didn't you?

But the weapon you were stabbed with was this candelabra! A fact I know you're quite aware of.

<hr />
<line>Nichody:
...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
It must've been a simple memory slip that made him misspeak. It happens to everyone. It has nothing to do with the case. You must be pretty desperate to point out something so minute.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grr!
</line><line>Judge:
I have to agree, Mr. Wright. You hardly need to make such a big deal over such a small mistake.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I contend that it's an important inconsistency! <textEffects>(Besides, I couldn't find anything else. This is the only thing I have to go after!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And I say it's NOT important. Now, let's not waste any more time on this matter.
</line><line>Judge:
I agree. Everybody has a little memory lapse every now and then.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But, Your Honor! Please let me explain!
</line><line>Judge:
But can you? Can you really explain to this court what makes this slip so important?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I can, Your Honor! <textEffects>(After all, it was Sorin himself who told Pierce that he had been stabbed by a candelabra. This is more than a simple "memory slip." There has to be some kind of reason for it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? Please explain why the witness's slip of the tongue is so important.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The point to focus on here is WHY the witness would mistake the weapon used to stab him. <textEffects>(Think carefully, Phoenix. This could very well change the course of the trial.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I see. So why did the witness make that mistake, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Mr. Sprocket identified the wrong weapon used against him because...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
...he doesn't remember the incident, let alone the weapon used against him! Not only that... ...but I believe Mr. Sprocket has some sort of memory disorder! Therefore, the defense contends that Mr. Sprocket's testimony thus far is invalid!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just because you can't find a flaw in his testimony, you want to throw it all out?! Your baseless claim is nothing but pure slander of the witness's character!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth is correct, Mr. Wright. Can you explain your grounds for making this claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Of course, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Think of what Sorin has said, how he's behaved. That's where I'll find a clue...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's hear your argument, then.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>My grounds for claiming that Mr. Sprocket has a memory disorder is...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
...the notebook he always has with him. I saw daily events and information about the people around him recorded in it.
</line><line>Judge:
Like a diary, perhaps?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. It's much too detailed to be an ordinary diary. It's more on the order of a database, actually.
</line><line>Judge:
A database, you say?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. For some reason, Mr. Sprocket is apparently unable to retain memories. That's why he writes every little detail of his life down in his notebook!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How could you possibly know that for sure?! He might just be an extremely compulsive person!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I thought so, too, myself... at first. To be honest, we accidentally got a stain on that notebook yesterday...
</line><line>Maya:
You mean, YOU got a stain on it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! YOU'RE the one who tried to grab it out of my--!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Never mind whose fault it was! Just get to the point already!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-Right... Sorry... Mr. Sprocket.
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
The page Ms. Fey got a stain on yesterday... That's the page with the details of your stabbing on it, isn't it?
</line><line>Sorin:
N-No! I only write in this notebook because I'm very compulsive! Now, drop the subject already!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but I'm not convinced. I noticed an odd fact about your notebook, Mr. Sprocket.
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
On the earlier pages, you used it to write down invention ideas. But after a certain date, you started writing down a lot more, and in much more detail.
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe your memory disorder... ...stems from what happened on that date!
</line><line>Judge:
Something so monumental, it caused a memory disorder, Mr. Wright...?
</line><line>Sorin:
...You don't know what you're talking about!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but I DO know what I'm talking about... And this is the proof. <textEffects>This is the thing that caused Mr. Sprocket's memory disorder.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
You were involved in this car accident, too, weren't you, Mr. Sprocket? And the shock of losing your beloved older sister... ...is what caused you to develop your memory disorder.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is this true, Mr. Sprocket?
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Is it?
</line><line>Sorin:
............ N-Nnrgh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Sprocket!
</line><line>Sorin:
Uuughhh...... I-It's true. That accident did something to my mind...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Sorin:
Ever since that day, every time I go to sleep, I lose my memories... And when I wake up, the most recent thing I can remember is the day I lost my sister. It's as if I'm constantly going back in time.
</line><line>Judge:
What...?! Th-That's... truly tragic...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
An inconsolable time traveler who goes back in time whenever he goes to sleep...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sorin:
Besides... time travelers do exist, you know. But you wouldn't understand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that's what Sorin meant... He was talking about himself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sorin:
The reactions of the people around me each time I awoke made me aware of my condition. That's why I decided to write everything down in my notebook... So I could move forward.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So the only memories you have since that day are the ones written in that notebook?
</line><line>Sorin:
...That's right.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And since the page about your stabbing got stained, you couldn't read from it, could you?
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's just one more thing I'd like you to clarify for me, Mr. Sprocket. Exactly what are your feelings toward the victim?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Sprocket's feelings toward Dumas Gloomsbury?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right, Your Honor. The witness said that every time he wakes up from sleep... ...his mind goes back to the day his sister died.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...M-Mr. Wright! Y-You can't mean...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Sprocket!
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your pent-up feelings of anger and resentment towards Mr. Gloomsbury for the accident... ...were renewed each and every time you woke, were they not?
</line><line>Sorin:
............Ngh.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you couldn't take it anymore, so you turned to murder! Isn't that right?!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?! Mr. Wright, are you saying that the witness murdered Mr. Gloomsbury... ...for revenge?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Urgh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Sprocket?
</line><line>Sorin:
...........I-I...

M-Ms. Wyatt! What are you trying to do?!

Are we to understand that you're confessing your guilt?

<textEffects>(No, no, NO!)</textEffects> Now, wait just a minute here--

</line><line>Sorin:
E-Ellen... Why would you cover for me...? After I testified that I thought you must've killed him...?
</line><line>Ellen:
I'll admit... I couldn't believe my ears at first... But... all I want is for you to be happy. Your happiness... is my happiness, Sorin.
</line><line>Sorin:
But without my notebook... ...I'd even forget those feelings of yours by tomorrow. Knowing that, do you still feel this way?
</line><line>Judge:
............
</line><line>Ellen:
You've loved me all this time... ...the same way you did before the accident. That's how I know... ...that you're the same person I've always loved. No disorder can change that!
</line><line>Sorin:
......Ellen... ......Your Honor, there are two things I'd like to correct.
</line><line>Judge:
Two corrections? What are they?
</line><line>Sorin:
First of all, I want to withdraw one of my statements. 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sorin:
...That's right... Dumas was killed... by Ellen.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sorin:
Without memories to rely on... ...I took the police completely at their word.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can't be serious...!
</line><line>Maya:
So that means... ...Sorin never really doubted Ellen in the first place, did he, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ellen really does love Sorin with all her heart... But, in order to save her... ...I'll still have to go after Sorin. I hope you can forgive me, Ellen!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
And what is your other correction, Mr. Sprocket?
</line><line>Sorin:
............ The truth is, I never felt anger or resentment towards Dumas about my sister.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? Why not?!
</line><line>Sorin:
That's because...... the one who caused the car accident... ...was me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Please continue, Mr. Sprocket.
</line><line>Sorin:
I'm the one who killed my sister... To protect my career and my future, my father made Dumas take the blame... ...in exchange for money and the position of lead servant.
</line><line><textEffects>Newspaper Article updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sorin:
So you see, Dumas must've held a grudge against me, not the other way around. And he must've attacked Ellen... to get his revenge on me...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you sure about all of this, Mr. Sprocket?
</line><line>Sorin:
Very sure. It's all been written down in detail in my notebook.
</line><line>Judge:
That notebook is important evidence supplying background to this case. I must insist you submit it as evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Sorin:
The lawyer said I had "turned to murder," but that's just not true. However, it is true that... ...my older sister and Dumas are both dead because of me and my negligence.
</line><line>Judge:
I just glanced through Mr. Sprocket's notebook. I wasn't able to read the part about when he was stabbed due to the bloodstain... ...but what's written here about his sister's car accident is exactly as he stated.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. As long as it matches what's written in that notebook... ...can we still take the witness's testimony as valid, in spite of his memory disorder?
</line><line>Judge:
...Yes, I believe we can.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I understand now that the witness's memory is in disarray. But if what Mr. Sprocket himself wrote in this notebook is true...
</line><line>Sorin:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then that means, by the time Mr. Sprocket's party reached the scene... ...the victim had already been killed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Edgeworth's right. I'm still in the same bind as before... But should I really simply accept the contents of the notebook... ...as a substitute for Sorin's memory?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Will you accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as an official representation of his memories?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Will I accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as an official representation of his memories...?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Wait a minute, Your Honor! The defense requests a chance to examine the notebook to see if it's trustworthy!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. But be quick about it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor.
</line><line>Maya:
So, how should we examine it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we should look at it from all different angles to see if there's anything suspicious.
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
It looks like a page has been torn out here. Mr. Sprocket, do you know what was written on it?
</line><line>Sorin:
Oh, that? I often tear out a page when I write somebody a note. I probably wrote something down for somebody, tore it out and gave it to them.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, yeah...!

That solves that, then.

</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Well... <textEffects>Let's see. To find out what was written in the notebook, we should...</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
If we use fingerprint powder on the notebook, we might be able to see what was written!
</line><line>Judge:
Fingerprint powder? How would that help us find out what was written there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, if the writing left indentations on the blank page behind it... ...fingerprint powder could make those small indentations visible to the naked eye.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh, stop. Fingerprint powder would only sully the notebook further.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, if you use the powder and still don't find anything... ...then you must accept the notebook as a representation of the witness's memories.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, Your Honor. I understand. <textEffects>(If I don't find anything, it's all over anyway... Powder, don't fail me now!)</textEffects> I will now use fingerprint powder on the blank page... ...to find out if we can see what was written on the torn-out page. <textEffects>(First, I touch a spot to dust it with</textEffects> <textEffects>fingerprint powder</textEffects>. <textEffects>When I've dusted on enough powder, I</textEffects> <textEffects>blow into the mic</textEffects><textEffects>... ...to blow the excess powder away.

It says, "I struck and killed Dumas"... <textEffects>(Th-This is huge...!)</textEffects> "I struck and killed Dumas..." That's what was written on the torn-out page!

Yes, Your Honor. Please give your ruling now, while Ellen is asleep. I want the woman I love to be set free as soon as possible.

I myself wrote of the crime in my notebook. No further proof is necessary.

</line><line>Judge:
Oh, is there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you doing, Mr. Wright?! All you have to do is keep quiet, and your client's a free woman!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know... but I think there might be more to this case than meets the eye. <textEffects>(I'm not quite sure yet... but I think there still might be a way... ...a way for Ellen and Sorin to be happy!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean by, "more than meets the eye," Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe the question here, Your Honor, should be... ...why was the incriminating page torn out in the first place?
</line><line>Judge:
Why, to destroy the evidence, I would imagine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But removing it from the notebook is the same as removing it from Mr. Sprocket's memory. Which means he wouldn't have been able to trick the police if he came under suspicion. No. If he wanted to cover up his crime, he would have to remember that he had done it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just what are you getting at with this line of inquiry, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, please explain it so that we can all understand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>The page was torn out of the notebook because...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The incriminating page... ...was torn out by somebody else!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?! Order! Order! Are you claiming a third person interfered with the notebook?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not all that surprising if you consider what's happened up until now. After both the car accident, and the murder of Dumas Gloomsbury... ...there was always a cover-up not far behind!
</line><line>Sorin:

</line><line>Sorin:
B-But... I had my notebook with me at all times!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Did you? Because I remember you were in a panic yesterday because you couldn't find it!
</line><line>Sorin:
Th-That's true...!
</line><line>Judge:
So who orchestrated this particular cover-up, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If we think back over the course of the trial, it's pretty easy to guess. <textEffects>(The one who may have tried to tamper with Sorin's memories is...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The one who tampered with the notebook in order to manipulate Mr. Sprocket's memory... ...is Pierce Nichody!
</line><line>Sorin:
Pierce...? Pierce tried to tamper with my memories...? Pierce was... manipulating me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Case in point: the two receptions that were held to cover up the murder. It was Mr. Nichody who directed the guests and orchestrated the entire scheme.
</line><line>Sorin:
N-No... It can't be... Which of my memories are mine, and which have been rewritten...? When did he start rewriting my memories...?! Who wrote this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-H-He literally took off!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
AAAGH!
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Maya:
...Look, Nick! He's coming back down!
</line><line>Sorin:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Sprocket!
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Please get Mr. Sprocket to the infirmary! On the double!

<line>Judge:
Mr. Sprocket has been taken to the infirmary. We don't have to worry about him running away, so let us resume where we left off.

Your Honor. The defense would like to call Pierce Nichody to the stand.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
We already know he carried out the cover-up to protect the company and Mr. Sprocket. What more do you want from him?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This time it's different. The notebook... or, rather, Mr. Sprocket's memories, have been tampered with. That means the only person who knows the whole truth... is now Mr. Nichody.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... Are you actually trying to drum up a third suspect... ...in order to exonerate the defendant and her groom?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not drumming up anything, nor do I have grounds to accuse him of anything... yet. All I know is that Mr. Nichody is the only one who knows the truth! <textEffects>(And I think he's still hiding something! Something we don't know about yet!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. No grounds "yet," is it?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution consent to calling the witness to the stand?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It does, Your Honor. ...However, I would like a little time to talk with the witness before we do.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. We will break for a twenty-minute recess.

Please state your name and occupation.
</line><line>Nichody:
My name is Pierce Nichody. I am the Sprocket family butler.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's get straight to the point, Mr. Nichody. Someone tore out a page from Mr. Sprocket's notebook to manipulate his memories. And that person was you... wasn't it?
</line><line>Nichody:
......That is correct. What about it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Well, that was easy!)</textEffects> So why did you do it?! Why did you tamper with Mr. Sprocket's notebook?!
</line><line>Nichody:
Please allow me to explain. It pains me to do this, but I will tell you the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It pains you...?
</line><line>Nichody:
...That is correct. For my testimony will go against Master Sorin's wishes.

<textEffects>-- Why I Tore Out the Page --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Nichody:
I rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.
I saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook.
Master Sorin said to me, "I'll take the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen."
But I went against his order. I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Wait a second...! What Mr. Sprocket was writing in his notebook at the time -- could it be...? <textEffects>(It was meant to be a confession -- an admission he'd killed Gloomsbury himself!)</textEffects> He wrote that message to take the blame for Ms. Wyatt?!
</line><line>Nichody:
That is correct. Master Sorin did hit Gloomsbury with the Time Keeper to save Miss Ellen...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then Mr. Sprocket was the culprit after all!
</line><line>Nichody:
However, that blow did not kill Gloomsbury.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That makes sense. Mr. Sprocket's injury wouldn't allow him to put much force into it.
</line><line>Nichody:
Enraged, Gloomsbury tried to attack Master Sorin, who was already seriously wounded. But just in the nick of time, Miss Ellen hit Gloomsbury from behind... ...and finished him off, it would seem.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So the one who inflicted the fatal blow was the defendant?
</line><line>Nichody:
...Yes, that is correct. But Master Sorin tried to take all of the blame onto himself.
</line><line>Maya:
N-No way...! This... is pretty bad, Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No kidding... <textEffects>("Pretty bad" is an understatement...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, well, Mr. Wright. It seems your decision to call for Mr. Nichody has backfired. For the true culprit behind this case remains the defendant, Ellen Wyatt!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's preposterous!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, this shows that the victim might have still been alive while inside the lantern!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid you'll have to point out which part you're talking about, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This part here shows that the victim might have still been alive inside the lantern!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
As you can see, the back end of the lantern is a door. And there's blood here on the wheel handle!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That bloodstain must have gotten there when the witness put the body inside the lantern. It, in no way, shows that the victim drew his last breath while he was within the lantern!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth. For you see, in putting this lantern back together... ...the police inadvertently placed the inside handle on the outside, and vice versa. In other words, the wheel handles got swapped!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! So they got swapped?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, they got swapped!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What? But that's ridiculous!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not at all. If you compare the other male Pegabull lantern in the reception hall... ...it's quite obvious the wheel handles were attached backwards!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-The detective in charge of the restoration will see me in my office later!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sorry, Ema... And good luck.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I-In that case, what does the bloodstain on the wheel handle mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bloodstain didn't get there by chance. When the victim was put inside the lantern, he was only unconscious, not dead. When he regained consciousness, he probably tried to get out of the lantern. So he grasped the inner wheel handle, and that's when the blood got on it! This proves that the victim was still alive when he was inside the lantern!
</line><line>Nichody:
At the time, I was completely convinced Gloomsbury was dead. Had I checked more carefully, he might have survived...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunate, to be sure... but not significant enough to change this trial's outcome.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Again, I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth. It actually has a very significant impact on this case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim was struck by the defendant, then died from his injuries some time later. There's nothing more to it!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
That's where you're wrong! Let's take another look at Mr. Gloomsbury's autopsy report, shall we? Please focus on the description of his injuries. It says, "One contusion was found on the back of his head, and one on the side."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, the one Mr. Sprocket gave him, and the one Ms. Wyatt delivered to finish him off.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, the defense would like to submit a different interpretation.
</line><line>Judge:
A different interpretation?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim was knocked unconscious by the first blow, and was then put into the lantern.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-Then, what about the lethal blow by the defendant that the witness talked about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, well... that didn't happen. After some time... ...when the victim regained consciousness and tried to get out of the lantern... ...that's when he received the second blow that finished him off!
</line><line>Judge:
Taking into account the fact that the victim was alive for a period after the first hit... ...and that he did receive a second blow to the head... It does seem entirely possible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. As long as the first blow didn't kill the victim instantly... ...then there's a possibility that... ...someone other than Mr. Sprocket or Ms. Wyatt delivered the fatal blow!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. That's all you've got? Even if there was a time lag between the two blows... ...the prosecution's position doesn't change.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's elementary, Mr. Wright. After the reception, when the defendant was cleaning up the reception hall... ...the victim, who was supposed to be dead, suddenly came out of the lantern. The defendant grabbed the murder weapon, which was right there, and finished him off.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That theory sounds awfully familiar...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course it does, Your Honor, because it's exactly what I proposed at the very start. The second blow was inflicted by the defendant after all!
</line><line>Judge:
I-I see! It seems a tangle of mysteries has unraveled into a single thread!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But as long as there's a possibility that the fatal blow was delivered by a third person... ...then we must continue the deliberations!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Give it up, Mr. Wright! Unless you have something to prove the presence of your precious "third person"?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I, uh...!
</line><line>Maya:
Okay, Nick! Just relax! You can do this! Come on, now. Take some deep breaths!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Good idea. Deep breaths... Deep breaths...
</line><line>Maya:
There! Don't you feel better already?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya's right. I should calm down, get my focus back, and go over everything again. And then, hopefully, I'll be able to find something to prove there was a third person!)</textEffects> ...Let's see. First, why did Gloomsbury attack Ellen?
</line><line>Maya:
Because... he was tired of taking the blame for the accident?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... But something about that line of reasoning just doesn't feel quite right to me...
</line><line>Maya:
No? How come?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, if it's just a personal vendetta, he had already stabbed Sorin. So why, then, was he so determined to go after Ellen?
</line><line>Maya:
You're right. This whole thing feels too premeditated for a crime of passion...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Gloomsbury didn't seem to have a personal grudge against Ellen... <textEffects>(If Gloomsbury didn't have a personal reason to attack Ellen, then...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You've taken long enough, Mr. Wright. Now it's time for some action. What proof do you have that a third person was involved?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. I'll show you. <textEffects>(I'm not completely sure of what I'm doing yet, but it looks like I'm out of time!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This piece of evidence proves the involvement of a third person!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I get it now... Now I see why this note bothered me so much when I first saw it.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
It looks like a note outlining the murder plot...
</line><line>Ema:
That note was apparently written by the victim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But why would he feel the need to write instructions to himself like this?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, please take a look at this note.
</line><line>Judge:
This is... the victim's <textEffects>murder plan</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's definitely "a" murder plan, but what if... ...Mr. Gloomsbury didn't write this note himself?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
THIS is how you intend to conjure up your mysterious third party, Mr. Wright? Can you even prove that that note wasn't written by the victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes. Yes, I can.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well, then. Please present your evidence, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This evidence proves the victim didn't write the note.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is the weapon Mr. Gloomsbury used to stab Mr. Sprocket.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you'd pull out this time. Dare I ask what that could possibly have to do with the note?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Gloomsbury's prints were found on this candelabra. And the prints were from his left hand.
</line><line>Judge:
So, that makes the victim left-handed, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. The police looked into it, too, and confirmed as much. Now, take a look at the smudged writing in this note. Notice how the smudging only starts from the middle of each proceeding line. Had this been written by a lefty, the writing would be smudged from the far left end. This means that whoever wrote this note was definitely right-handed. In other words, somebody other than the victim wrote this note!
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Hmm... But if someone other than Mr. Gloomsbury wrote it, then what does this note mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Gloomsbury followed this note to the letter when he attacked Ms. Wyatt. So, clearly, this note isn't a murder plan written by Mr. Gloomsbury, but rather... ...these are instructions to kill Ms. Wyatt, issued by somebody else!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If it wasn't the victim who wrote these so-called "instructions"... ...then who wrote it? Most of the people involved are right-handed, you know.
</line><line>Nichody:
He is correct. The majority of the family and their employees who were on the airship... ...are indeed right-handed. I must say, that is a very rough and slipshod conjecture you've proposed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nnngh! <textEffects>(I admit I haven't figured out who wrote it just yet...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Leave it to Mr. Edgeworth to go for the jugular...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This culprit who ordered Gloomsbury to attack Ellen... ...what could their motive have been?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
It doesn't seem very likely Ellen did anything to incur anybody's wrath, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right... <textEffects>(Not too likely, anyway...)</textEffects> In that case, it has to be about Sorin.
</line><line>Maya:
If somebody were to hold a grudge against Sorin, what would it be about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That accident, I'd guess. I could understand if Gloomsbury felt resentful about having to take the blame.
</line><line>Maya:
But the one who lost the most to that accident was Sorin's sister... She lost her life, after all. Sorin suffered, too, of course. He was crushed by losing somebody so precious to him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Somebody precious," huh... "Sorin's sister"... Wait! There's one more person! There's someone else who must hold a grudge against Sorin!
</line><line>Maya:
Did you figure something out?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think so... I think this "somebody else" used Gloomsbury to try and get revenge against Sorin.
</line><line>Judge:
Did you say somebody tried to get revenge against Mr. Sprocket, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The person who manipulated and used Mr. Gloomsbury was...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The person who used Mr. Gloomsbury to try and get revenge on Mr. Sprocket... ...and then finished Mr. Gloomsbury off to silence him... ...was a man dear to Mr. Sprocket's older sister: Selena Sprocket's fiancé! <textEffects>(Not that I'm positive, but it's certainly possible... This fiancé could have made Gloomsbury attack Ellen to get his revenge on Sorin.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Judge:
Her fiancé?! Order in the court! Order, I say! Yes, it does seem quite believable that Ms. Selena Sprocket's fiancé... ...would bear a grudge against Mr. Sprocket for his role in the accident.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. Maybe her fiancé was trying to murder Ms. Wyatt... ...in order to make Mr. Sprocket experience the same pain he'd felt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Sprocket's fiancé... was a surgeon, if memory serves. But the only people who attended the reception were family and staff members.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That may be, but then that just means that Ms. Sprocket's fiancé must have been... ...among those who attended!
</line><line>Maya:
What?! Really?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course. Otherwise, how could he have killed Gloomsbury?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh... I see what you're doing... This is just another giant bluff, isn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All right. I'll bite. Who exactly do you claim this fiancé to be?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes! I would like to know as well!
</line><line>Maya:
A-Are you sure you're gonna be okay, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maybe...? <textEffects>(When it comes to suspicious people, there's only one person on my list... I need to find something that connects him to Selena...)</textEffects> This will help us identify Ms. Sprocket's fiancé!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at this photo, Your Honor.
</line><line>Nichody:
Th-That photo...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Notice Ms. Sprocket's pocket watch. Haven't we seen it somewhere before?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, yes. Now that you mention it, I do feel as if I've seen it somewhere before...
</line><line>Nichody:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe we've all seen it... right here in this very courtroom!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Augh! I-Impossible...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. The pocket watch in this photo... ...is the same pocket watch Mr. Nichody has on him right now!
</line><line>Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is clear proof... ...of a strong connection between Pierce Nichody and Selena Sprocket!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Nichody? Is this true?
</line><line>Nichody:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Nichody... You were once engaged to Selena Sprocket. That pocket watch... You keep it as a memento of her, don't you?
</line><line>Nichody:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Nichody, you planned to rob Mr. Sprocket of his loved one... ...to make him feel the same pain as you. Isn't that right?
</line><line>Nichody:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Mr. Sprocket managed to fight back, and knocked Mr. Gloomsbury unconscious. You thought Mr. Gloomsbury was dead, and hid his body in the lantern.
</line><line>Nichody:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
But then you noticed Mr. Gloomsbury regain consciousness... ...and so you finished him off to prevent your plan from being exposed. This is the defense's take on what really happened in this murder case.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, does this mean... ...you wish to officially accuse this witness of the murder of Dumas Gloomsbury?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Does the defense accuse Mr. Nichody of the murder...?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense indicts Pierce Nichody on the charge of murdering Dumas Gloomsbury!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! M-Mr. Nichody, would you care to respond?
</line><line>Nichody:
............ Man, this lawyer just yaps on and on and on... As you guessed, this watch is a memento of Selena. It stopped working at the time of the accident, though...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Then, you really are...!
</line><line>Nichody:
......Yes, I was Selena's fiancé. And not just her fiancé... ...but the surgeon beside her deathbed.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Nichody! Why didn't you tell me any of this before?!
</line><line>Nichody:
Shut it, you useless prosecutor. I thought you could be of use, but apparently, this case was too much for you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did you say?!
</line><line>Nichody:
If your office hadn't stuck its nose all up in this, I could've swept it under the rug. Not only did you interfere with the case, but you even let me fall under suspicion!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's because you kept trying to cover things up on the sly!
</line><line>Nichody:
Urrgh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But covering things up wasn't your only involvement. The only person who had a motive to use the victim to try and kill Ms. Wyatt... ...was you!
</line><line>Nichody:
N-Nngrrrrrrrr! Malignant tumors... There are malignant tumors in this courtroom, lesions oozing with false charges! The tumors are one idiotic lawyer, and one useless prosecutor! After the truth is revealed, I'll have the both of you incised from the legal world!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'd like to see you try.
</line><line>Nichody:
With the power of the Sprocket family, it'd be a cinch. I will now begin the operation!
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-What in the world happened to Mr. Nichody...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Looks like he's finally showing his true colors.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Look what he did to that shoulder mech!
</line><line>Nichody:
Quit your yapping, before I suture your chatty lips shut.
</line><line>Maya:
It's like he's a completely different person...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure looks like it, huh. We can't let our guards down now! Mr. Nichody, it's finally time for you to testify... ...to the truth!
</line><line>Judge:
...It seems we're entering the final act at last. Witness, your testimony, please.

You want me to voluntarily testify, hoping I will make a slip of the tongue. Not a very impressive plan... or brain, I might add.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ow... That was uncalled for...)</textEffects>

If you want to know something, YOU ask the question. I will answer, but I have no intention of making any voluntary statements of my own.

<textEffects>Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Nichody:
<textEffects>I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
Nichody:
<textEffects>I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Nichody testifies that he was always with someone at the time of the incident... ...and never had a moment alone to commit the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes. And the police investigation backs that statement up, doesn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But there WAS an opportunity, in fact -- one and only one. A moment when Mr. Nichody could have killed Mr. Gloomsbury without anyone noticing!
</line><line>Nichody:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And <textEffects>the one thing</textEffects> that made that moment possible... ...is shown here in this photograph!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Nichody, I would ask that YOU keep quiet this time. We need to evaluate the defense's claim. And your yammering only serves to throw further suspicion your way.
</line><line>Nichody:
N-Nnrrgh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, let's see this "one thing" you mentioned. But be warned, this had better not be one of your offhanded claims.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who do you think you're talking to, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please point out for us the "one thing" that made the moment of the murder possible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That one moment when it was possible for Mr. Nichody to kill Mr. Gloomsbury... <textEffects>The one thing that made that single moment possible... is this!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The one thing that made the moment of the murder possible... ...is this thick mood fog that engulfed the entire reception hall! It is under the cover of this fog... ...that Mr. Nichody murdered the victim!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Nichody was standing right next to the lantern that Mr. Gloomsbury was in! This was the only moment the murder could have been committed without being seen!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
............ I can accept that there was a moment when the witness was obscured from others by fog. But that doesn't prove Mr. Nichody killed the victim at that very moment! If you can't prove the crime was committed during the reception, the trial ends here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nnrgh! <textEffects>(I was so caught up in finding a foothold that I forgot to think that far ahead!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nichody:
Well done, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to call this trial's time of death!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove the murder happened during the reception?
</line><line>Nichody:
Don't even bother! His claim is dead on arrival! Victory is within your grasp, Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Quiet, witness. I have no interest in "victory." All I care about... is <textEffects>the truth</textEffects>. One that we can only arrive at through further deliberation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth...!
</line><line>Nichody:
Enough of this! Your Honor, this trial is over!
</line><line>Judge:
No, Mr. Nichody. That is for me to decide. Mr. Wright, can you prove it? Can you prove that the murder was committed during the wedding reception?
</line><line>Nichody:
Why is there no verdict yet?! The lawyer's obviously out of answers! The prosecutor, the judge -- they're all infected! Their malignant stupidity is so advanced, not even the best surgeons can save them! In fact, not even a brain transplant could cure them! This court is infected with idiocy! It's a pandemic!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Nichody! That's enough already!
</line><line>Nichody:
Finally ready to give up, are you?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, just the opposite, actually. I'll prove the murder was committed during the reception... by you!
</line><line>Nichody:
Agnk! ...You'll prove it...?
</line><line>Judge:
Can you really, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, I can, Your Honor! <textEffects>(To be honest, I don't know exactly how I'll do it just yet... But if I want to get to the truth Edgeworth was talking about... ...I'll just have to find that way!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your proof.
</line><line>Nichody:
Enough of this foolishness! He's just bluffing! Stop him from speaking, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
I will do nothing of the sort.
</line><line>Nichody:
You are just a district court judge! With the power of the Sprocket family, I'll--!
</line><line>Judge:
Enough of YOUR foolishness, Mr. Nichody. This judicial body will not succumb to the influence of money or power. 
</line><line>Nichody:
Urk...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, then. Let's hear it, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your truth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Think, Phoenix! Remember everything you've learned so far! You can do this! You can find the definitive evidence that will lead us to the truth!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Think, Phoenix! How can I prove the murder took place during the wedding reception? <textEffects>If Pierce committed the murder during the reception, then he had to have used...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>He used the murder weapon</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Yes, the weapon that was used to strike the victim twice! According to the autopsy report, the victim was hit by the same object both times. So, without a doubt, Pierce used it to commit the murder! <textEffects>The weapon used to kill Gloomsbury was...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>The Time Keeper was the murder weapon</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
If Pierce struck the victim during that one, single moment... ...then he must have used the Time Keeper! Come to think of it, wasn't it also used for something else during the reception? <textEffects>During the reception, the Time Keeper was also used for...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>THE TIME KEEPER HAD BEEN ACTIVATED</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
That's right! The Time Keeper had been activated during the reception! If we activate the Time Keeper again now, and find any trace evidence of the murder... ...that would be conclusive proof that Gloomsbury was killed during the reception!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
A special ceremony took place during the reception in question.
</line><line>Judge:
What kind of a special ceremony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was called, "the First Startup of Love." Apparently, the couple activated the Time Keeper for the first time during it.
</line><line>Judge:
Does that mean the Time Keeper here in evidence isn't activated at the moment? And what would happen... if we were to activate it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why don't we see for ourselves? It would give us a chance to examine it. And while we're at it, we just might find some conclusive evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Nichody:
N-No! Y-You can't activate it!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Nichody! Keep quiet, or I'll have you thrown out of court!
</line><line>Nichody:
Nnrgh...!
</line><line>Judge:
By the way, Mr. Wright... This is supposed to be a time machine, right? We aren't going to travel back in time to the Stone Age or anything, are we?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I don't think we have to worry too much about that, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm still a little nervous, nonetheless... but the truth must be known. Very well. Go ahead and start up the Time Keeper!
</line><line>Maya:
Do you know how, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, I think so...? Maybe...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maid:
The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Let's see... I think the symbol of the groom's love must be the Time Keeper itself. What symbol of the bride's love would fit together with the Time Keeper? <textEffects>(Oh, I know! That has to be it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Are you ready to activate the time machine now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>The symbol of the bride's love that's necessary for activating the Time Keeper is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Wyatt's pendant... ...is the symbol of the bride's love that is necessary for activating the Time Keeper!
</line><line>Judge:
What?! Then does that mean you can start it up with Ms. Wyatt's pendant?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I believe so, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please try it now, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, here I go. <textEffects>(But first, I have to figure out where the pendant goes...)</textEffects>
</line>






<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I... I think I found it..! Conclusive evidence that the murder was committed during the wedding reception!)</textEffects> Just as I suspected, there's evidence of the murder inside the Time Keeper, Mr. Nichody. The Time Keeper was only activated and open during the wedding reception, right?
</line><line>Nichody:
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Stoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, that means... ...this is conclusive proof that the crime was committed during the reception!
</line><line>Nichody:
ACK!
</line><line>Phoenix:
After you killed the victim under the cover of fog... ...you closed the Time Keeper to hide the bloodstain, didn't you?
</line><line><textEffects>Time Keeper updated in Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Nichody:
N-No! You're wrong! Ellen killed Gloomsbury! It wasn't me, I tell you!

</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no way you can talk your way out of this, Mr. Nichody! During the reception, during that one dreamlike moment... ...only one person could have used the Time Keeper to beat the victim to death. And that one person was you, Pierce Nichody!
</line><line>Nichody:
NGHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ACK! No... This isn't over yet... I won't give up...! Oh, no! I cut the artery! This stupid thing! We must stop the bleeding now! Give me forceps! Forceps, I said! Hey! Where is everyone?! Fine... I'll manage this alone! I'll do it all by myself! I can fix anything! Repair anything! So you have to get better! You have to live! You must! ...I... I would've been able to save her... If only I hadn't listened to her... If only I had treated her first... If only that Sorin... hadn't been there............ Augh! S-Selena... No...
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Judge:
............ Witness... Are you finally ready to tell us the truth?
</line><line>Nichody:
It's just as the lawyer deduced...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So it was all a revenge scheme against Sorin Sprocket?
</line><line>Nichody:
............ Do you have any idea how hard it is to lose someone you love, right in front of you? Selena's condition was clearly more critical than Sorin's, but, in spite of that, she said...
</line>
<captions aligned="center">"Please help Sorin."</captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Sprocket's last words...  <textEffects>(So that's what she really meant by those words...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nichody:
I was able to grant her wish, but at the price of her life...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you got a job with Sprocket Aviation and waited for your chance to get revenge. You got close to Mr. Gloomsbury, and hatched this plot. Is that right?
</line><line>Nichody:
Gloomsbury already bore a grudge against Sorin... ...so when I tempted him with an even better position, he immediately took the bait.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He was your accomplice, someone who shared the same goal as you... Why was it necessary for you to kill him?
</line><line>Nichody:
I didn't expect Sorin to strike Gloomsbury out on the vista deck... ...and I certainly never imagined he'd make his way there along the outside wall.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sorin's love is the real deal after all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nichody:
My plan had been compromised, so for the time being, I hid his body in the lantern... ...and tried to think of my next move.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And then Mr. Gloomsbury came to during the second wedding reception.
</line><line>Nichody:
As soon as I saw Gloomsbury, I instantly hit upon an idea... ...to pin the blame of Gloomsbury's murder on Ellen.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You tried to break up the couple by making the bride out to be a murderer... How despicable! 
</line><line>Nichody:
Sorin was getting the company and a wedding... Both things that were supposed to be Selena's! He took every happiness from her. Who's the despicable one here?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do you think what you did would make her happy?
</line><line>Nichody:
I know it wouldn't! But I couldn't just stand by, watching Sorin enjoy his happiness... I was going to have Sorin taste the same pain I had, and then take over Sprocket Aviation... I would take back from him all the happiness that was rightfully Selena's...
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
............
</line><line>Nichody:
Time stopped for me the day I lost her... Just like this pocket watch of hers.

P-Pierce...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Wyatt?
</line><line>Ellen:
I believe Selena would've said... "Leave this ill will behind. Your time is yours to live."
</line><line>Nichody:
...It's too late for me. Time will never advance for me ever again...
</line>
<captions aligned="center">*click*</captions>
<line>Nichody:
...What? I-It can't be... I see now, Selena... What I did... was wrong...
</line><line>Judge:
I see no further need to continue this trial. Bailiff, please take Mr. Nichody away.
</line><line>Phoenix:

<line>Judge:
Now then, I must render my verdict regarding the defendant... Hm?
</line><line>Sorin:
Your Honor... Before you give your ruling, would you please allow me a moment?
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well.
</line><line>Sorin:
Ellen, there's something I need to say to you...
</line><line>Ellen:
Y-Yes, Sorin?
</line><line>Sorin:
I've put you through something truly horrible. This whole thing happened... all because of me. I... I would understand if you wanted to call off our marriage...
</line><line>Ellen:
...Whaaaaat? O-Of course not! I've never once thought that!
</line><line>Sorin:
If you stay with me, you'll only face even more trying times in the future.
</line><line>Ellen:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Sorin:
The truth of this incident, and the car accident before it... ...I'm going to tell the public everything.
</line><line>Ellen:
............
</line><line>Sorin:
I expect the company's reputation will suffer, and I'll take a lot of criticism. But I feel... ...I can only really start over once I get everything out in the open.
</line><line>Ellen:
Sorin...
</line><line>Sorin:
After all that's happened, I might not have the right to ask you this, but... ...Well... Um... How should I say this...? Um... Maybe I'll just... A life with me probably won't be very easy, but... ...will you marry me?
</line><line>Ellen:
............Yes, of course!
</line><line>Sorin:
Your Honor, thank you for this time. Please, continue with your ruling.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. But, first, I have one question. Do the two of you pledge your eternal love for each other to the goddess of justice, Themis?
</line><line>Sorin:
I do, Your Honor.
</line><line>Ellen:
I do.
</line><line>Judge:
Does the prosecution or defense have any objections?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Well done, Your Honor... No, no objections here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense has no objections either, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt... Ah, that's not right... This court finds the defendant, Ellen Sprocket...

<line>Phoenix:
Ellen, Sorin, congratulations!
</line><line>Ellen:
Mr. Wright! I can't thank you enough! If you hadn't exposed the truth, Sorin and I wouldn't... We wouldn't... *sniffle*
</line><line>Phoenix:
But now you can finally start your new life together, right?
</line><line>Ellen:
OH, THAAAAAAAAAANK YOOOOOOOOOUUUUU!
</line><line>Sorin:
...Mr. Wright. We'll be holding our real wedding ceremony in the near future. Would you do us the honor of coming to it? I want you to witness our fresh start.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course! I wouldn't miss it for the world. And, Ellen, this time, it'll finally be "happily ever after," right?
</line><line>Ellen:
Oh, yes!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The two of you have persevered, and overcome this trial together. Now, no matter what obstacles come your way, I'm sure you'll be able to handle them. And there's another thing I'm sure of, too. <textEffects>This person will always be watching over the two of you.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ellen:
Selena... Yes, I think you're right. And we promise to live life to the fullest -- for Selena's sake, too! ...Right, Sorin?
</line><line>Sorin:
...That's right. Well, we'd better be on our way.
</line><line>Ellen:
Yes, my love!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wow! The ol' "threshold carry," huh? Way to show off!
</line><line>Sorin:
We'll be seeing you! Goodbye for now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll be looking forward to that wedding!
</line><line>Sorin:
Hold on tight, Ellen.
</line><line>Ellen:
You better believe I will! I'm never letting you go!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There they go...
</line><line>???:
You're not thinking of going to that wedding by yourself, are you, Boss?
</line><line>Maya:
You're taking us, too, right?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, boy! I bet there's gonna be all kinds of fancy food there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena? When did you get here?
</line><line>Athena:
Just now. I would've been here to cheer you guys on earlier, but... ...Trucy never gave me a chance to slip away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You're going to be in even bigger trouble with her later...!)</textEffects> Speaking of the wedding... ...maybe I should ask them to invite Edgeworth.
</line><line>Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth?! Really?! But he thought Ellen was guilty all the way to the end!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That may be true, but...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nichody:
Don't even bother! His claim is dead on arrival! Victory is within your grasp, Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Quiet, witness. I have no interest in "victory." All I care about... is <textEffects>the truth</textEffects>. One that we can only arrive at through further deliberation.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
If he hadn't stood up for us when he did, the trial probably would've ended there.
</line><line>Maya:
You mean Mr. Edgeworth gave us that chance?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe... Though, knowing him, I doubt he'd ever tell, even if I asked.
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... Well, if that's how you feel about it, Nick, then why not try to get him invited!
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, Maya! Have you ever tried to catch the bouquet?
</line><line>Maya:
What?! Um, no...
</line><line>Athena:
I never have, either! Fighting over a bouquet that's been tossed by the bride... Talk about a fierce competition! I'm totally stoked!
</line><line>Maya:
I'm not sure it's really supposed to be all that competitive...
</line><line>Athena:
I'm a pretty good jumper, so I think I've got a chance!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's... definitely missing the point of the whole thing...)</textEffects> ...And Larry, how did you manage to stay so quiet for so long?
</line><line>Larry:
...Shut up! Wishing the lady you fell in love with every happiness is what a real man does!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm pretty sure that "relationship" was over before it even began, Larry...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
*sniffle* Darn it all! If only I was ten years younger, things would've gone differently... Hands of time, why won't you turn back for meeeeeeeeeee!

<textEffects>(Today is Ellen and Sorin's third wedding ceremony and reception... I heard the bride and groom insisted it be on the Flying Chapel again. In the end, they were nice enough to invite me and Maya... And Athena kind of invited herself... They also invited Edgeworth, Ema, and even Larry! They say third time's the charm, right? I really do hope it's "happily ever after" for them this time around! Still, I get the feeling it's going to be one rowdy party...)</textEffects>
