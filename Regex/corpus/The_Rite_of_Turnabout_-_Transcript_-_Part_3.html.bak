<line>Phoenix:
Looks like the police already finished their investigation. <textEffects>(To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa: 
As the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
As I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this!
</line><line>Rayfa:
And you can prove this... how?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?!
</line><line>Rayfa:
You and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled.
</line><line>???:
Hey, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema!
</line><line>Rayfa:
It's that detective from your country again...
</line><line>Ema:
Eep, it's the princess!
</line><line>Rayfa:
You seem displeased that I am here.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine...
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally.
</line><line>Ema:
Gladly. I'll help in any way I can!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Remember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds.
</line><line>Ema:
Of course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here.

<line>Phoenix:
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but...
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Oh, it's you.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Barbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say.
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Very well.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Is this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now. ...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Maya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
I-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found!
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
How can you be so sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
So you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can.
</line><line>Rayfa:
A-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations."
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!)</textEffects>

<line>Maya:
...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya sure looks tired.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today.
</line><line>Maya:
I'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this 
case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow.
</line><line>Maya:
It's not like I don't believe in you, it's just...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside-out and upside-down! You'll see!
</line><line>Maya:
O-Okay...
</line><line>Rayfa:
.....................
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Rayfa:
It is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end.
</line><line>Rayfa:
There is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her.
</line><line>Maya:
...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Barbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She obviously doesn't know me very well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Then, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and--
</line><line>Maya:
Hold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya,what are you...
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick here is risking his life to defend me.
</line><line>Rayfa:
And that is why I told you it will come to nau--
</line><line>Maya:
No, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Enough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
But your <textEffects>Insights</textEffects> were wrong!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Nnngrrrr...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Don't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your <textEffects>Insights</textEffects> are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Oooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney!
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Please, you two! Enough already!
</line><line>Maya:
S-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No,I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I 
guess.)</textEffects>

<line><i>After clearing all Talk options:</i>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I should get going now.
</line><line>Maya:
...Sorry I wasn't any help.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick!
</line><line>Maya:
...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You can have whatever you like! <textEffects>(But first, I have to beat the charges.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! I almost forgot!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! Wh-What is it?
</line><line>Maya:
I have a favor to ask.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay... But why are we whispering?
</line><line>Maya:
I forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's <textEffects>super important</textEffects>! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure. So what's this <textEffects>super important</textEffects> thing?
</line><line>Maya:
In my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the <textEffects>Tome of Secrets</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? <textEffects>(That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Look, it's got <textEffects>Lady Kee'ra's real name</textEffects> written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>Tome of Secrets</textEffects> contains... secrets? Imagine that.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hm? What are you two whispering about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it.
</line><line>Rayfa:
...You are up to something, I just know it.
</line><line>Maya:
Thanks, Nick! I'm counting on you!

Hello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for.

I am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything!

I would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Relax. My hand just slipped.
</line><line>Rayfa:
This is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out!

Oh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions?

<line>Rayfa:
Are you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... If the queen is a <textEffects>spirit medium</textEffects>...
</line><line>Rayfa:
Are you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! 
<textEffects>(I guess she saw that one coming.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course...
</line><line>Rayfa:
My mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk! <textEffects>(Another dead end! This is bad!)</textEffects> A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so...
</line><line>???:
Over there! After him! Don't let him escape!
</line><line>Rayfa:
What is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Escaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard?
</line><line>Rayfa:
There is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.)</textEffects> Let's go take a look!

Wait!

*huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home.
</line><line>???:
Ah, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
*huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi--
</line><line>Ahlbi:
A-Are you all right, sir?
</line><line>Phoenix:
One second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Oh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about <textEffects>an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Barbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby!
</line><line>Rayfa:
What sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's fearless, I'll give her that.)</textEffects> I can't be responsible if something happens to you. <textEffects>(As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?)</textEffects>

Your Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wait!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about.
</line><line>Rayfa:
That is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, are you worried about me?
</line><line>Rayfa:
No. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm doing this to prove Maya innocent.
</line><line>Rayfa:
But how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty!
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside-out and upside-down! You'll see!

O-Okay...

<line>Phoenix:
I believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do.

</line><line>Datz:
Sorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.)</textEffects> I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. <textEffects>(I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.)</textEffects> What is this place?
</line><line>Datz:
This is the <textEffects>office of my brother in arms, Dhurke</textEffects>! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly?
</line><line>Datz:
A <textEffects>law office</textEffects>, what else?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Really?! Dhurke <textEffects>used to be a lawyer</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Datz:
Yep! Just like you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Datz:
But I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You won't? Are you planning to flee or something?
</line><line>Datz:
It's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff.
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-Really...?
</line><line>Datz:
I'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that! 
</line><line>Datz:
Relax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Tell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot.
</line><line>Datz:
Sure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so...

<textEffects>(I wonder how true that really is...)</textEffects>

Go ahead, shoot.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you rebels trying to do?
</line><line>Datz:
..................
</line><line>Phoenix:
And why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I heard <textEffects>these flowers are offered in memory of the dead</textEffects> here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well?
</line><line>Datz:
Hee-HO!
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Datz:
Those flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why hide the fact that you're mourning his death?
</line><line>Datz:
You're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately!
</line><line>Datz:
And how exactly do you plan on proving that?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels! </textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you?
</line><line>Datz:
Gulp!
</line><line>Phoenix:
They brought this food for you at your request.
</line><line>Datz:
Hoo-HA HA!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you?
</line><line>Datz:
Naaaaaaaargh!
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Phoenix:
Are you ready to tell me the truth now?
</line><line>Datz:
Oh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Datz:
With my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell <textEffects>just by looking at you</textEffects>. The <textEffects>white-hot flames of revolution</textEffects> definitely still burn on inside of you!
</line><line>Datz:
What?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Datz:
Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look at the <textEffects>mark</textEffects> branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the <textEffects>will of the dragon</textEffects>!
</line><line>Datz:
Yeah? So what of it?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel!
</line><line>Datz:
I-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel!
</line><line>Datz:
Hoo-HA!
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Datz:
Think whatcha want! But you don't know nothing about me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, you're wrong. You wear your heart and your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. <textEffects>And this is what I believe in.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Datz:
...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
When a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on <textEffects>what they believe in</textEffects>. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the <textEffects>will of the dragon</textEffects> with you.
</line><line>Datz:
And would you risk your life for your beliefs?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...No, I wouldn't.
</line><line>Datz:
No?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you!
</line><line>Datz:
.........That look in your eyes. It's just like Dhurke's. ...Looks like you've got the <textEffects>will of the dragon</textEffects> inside o' ya, too.

Shah'do... What happened to him, anyway?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
He came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help!
</line><line>Shah'do:
*whine*
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Well? Did you find anything of worth?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. <textEffects>(I better keep things to myself for now.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
I figured as much.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.)</textEffects>

Barbed Head. You already searched here, did you not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? <textEffects>(I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.)</textEffects> We have a saying back home: "<textEffects>Leave no stone unturned.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one.

Wh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't think she's ready for the full story...)</textEffects> I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a <textEffects>secret rebel hideout</textEffects>. <textEffects>(If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
A rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wait! You must not enter before the police!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry, I won't disturb anything. <textEffects>(Or at least I'll try not to...)</textEffects> Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see...
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course. Now, shall we?
</line><line>Rayfa:
I will go no further.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Very good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering!
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Oh, well thank you! <textEffects>(Wait, why am I thanking her?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
I may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I told you I'm not going to do anything! <textEffects>(I better hurry before she changes her mind!)</textEffects>

<line>Rayfa:
I believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
To think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!)</textEffects> I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. <textEffects>(Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Stop that! You must not take photos here without permission!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be "tainted" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?)</textEffects>

I heard you the first time! <textEffects>(Sheesh...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it!  <textEffects>(...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that.
</line><line>Rayfa:
It is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently!
</line><line>Ema:
Sorry...
</line><line>Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned.

<line>Ahlbi:
Welcome back, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
N-No way!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...I do not understand, Barbed Head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What don't you understand?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Why you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Who told you that?
</line><line>Rayfa:
My mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's going on?
</line><line>Rayfa:
I must go perform a Divination Séance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see...
</line><line>Rayfa:
.........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.)</textEffects> I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Why don't we go over everything you know so far?
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
That doesn't sound very good!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
None of that sounds very helpful.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
What?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ahlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
I-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Oh, that's too bad.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Wow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
We'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Princess Rayfa's <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Th-The Divination Séance?! But I thought it always works against the accused!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Not always.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Datz:
Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ahlbi:
Really?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Divination Séances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Um, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. <textEffects>(I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's <span style="color:#E16935">Insights</textEffects> will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!)</span>
