</line><line>Bailiff:
Excuse me, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes?
</line><line>Bailiff:
His Honor would like to transfer the evidence from today's trial over to you. So if you could please head over to the courtroom, it'd be much appreciated, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood. I'll be there shortly. Detective Badd... What does the law mean to you?
</line><line>Badd:
.............................. Finding the answer to that question is the only reason I'm still alive...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I became a prosecutor to find the answer to that question myself... ...and to play a part in ensuring that all criminals everywhere are found guilty!)</textEffects>

<line>Judge:
...Oh, it's you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...*sigh*...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It appears that His Honor is still a bit dispirited...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
For the first time today, I experienced what it's like to stand at the witness stand... *sigh* I now have a greater appreciation... for just how hard it is to give testimony.
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, there's no reason for you to be all depressed about it, Your Honor. As a judge, no one expects you to think about anything other than the verdict.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska, there is no need to further depress His Honor.
</line><line>Franziska:
But I'm not trying to, Miles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor...
</line><line>Judge:
Ehh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I've come to collect the evidence that was to be transferred to me.
</line><line>Judge:
He...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The evidence...?
</line><line>Judge:
I...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! Y-You! Yes, can I help you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'd like to collect the evidence now, sir.
</line><line>Franziska:
Your Honor... Do you think you can stay focused long enough to at least do your job!?
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, I'm sorry! And I would, except that the defense attorney has yet to arrive.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She is busy with the investigation, so let's keep this brief, shall we?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. In that case, please confirm that all the pieces of evidence are present. Furthermore, the evidence that was used in the murders of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...are also included, so please go ahead and use them in your investigation into their case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood, Your Honor. <textEffects>(The pieces of evidence that were used in the murder of those two men... This could be a very good chance for me to find new leads regarding their case. And maybe even something that will finally lead me to the truth!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I've placed all of the evidence over at the Prosecutor's Bench for you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. Thank you very much. I will go and confirm that they are all accounted for.

<line><i>(Examining knife and organizer leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm, that's odd...
</line><line>Franziska:
What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday didn't mention anything about a <textEffects>knife</textEffects> in his organizer.
</line><line>Franziska:
...That certainly is odd.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The weapon that was used to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member was the gun. But if that's the case... ...then where did the knife that was used to murder Mr. Faraday come from!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Isn't it obvious? It was brought into the courthouse by Mr. Rell! That's the only logical conclusion, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, because it's not that easy to smuggle a weapon like that in here. Every person who enters the courthouse doors is checked thoroughly for contraband. Furthermore, the suspect was handcuffed... ...making it possible for him to bring a knife as large as this inside.
</line><line>Franziska:
In that case... how do YOU suppose this knife ended up inside the courthouse!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. <textEffects>(I need to think carefully here... There is nothing related to the knife written anywhere in Mr. Faraday's organizer... However... it is a fact that this knife... ...came from Mr. Faraday's evidence bag. ...Conversely, there is one item listed in Mr. Faraday's organizer... ...that no one has claimed to have seen today! So in order to solve this mystery... ...I believe I will need to take another good look at the evidence.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... Can I take the fact that you have yet to answer me... ...to mean that you don't have an answer for me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, I do know the answer, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
What!? Then what is it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
One of the pieces of evidence we've been holding has been hiding a secret of its own. <textEffects>And it was through this piece of evidence that the knife was brought into the courthouse!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This "<textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects>" Mr. Faraday mentions in his organizer... This is how the knife was brought into the courthouse.
</line><line>Franziska:
You're not making any sense, Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... You just need to look a bit closer, Franziska, to see what I mean. Don't the color and ornamentation of the key's handle remind you of anything?
</line><line>Franziska:
..................They do remind me of the knife...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very good. Both the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> in this photo and the murderous <textEffects>knife</textEffects>... ...have this very unique design on their handles. Furthermore, even though Mr. Faraday mentions the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects>... ...the only object we found at the crime scene was the <textEffects>knife</textEffects>.
</line><line>Franziska:
Y-You don't seriously mean to say...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears that you've finally caught up. And yes, I DO mean to say that these two pieces are, in fact, one and the same!
</line><line>Franziska:
But that's impossible!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even if that is what you believe, we should still investigate this possibility.
</line><line>Franziska:
Nnrgh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, let us examine this knife in a little more detail.
</line>


<line>Franziska:
I can't believe it turned into a key! To think there was such a trick to this thing...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So the weapon used to kill Mr. Faraday is actually the key the Yatagarasu stole... <textEffects>(This piece of information is more critical than anything we've learned up until now!)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
...Frankly, I'm shocked.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday only mentioned the key aspect of this piece of evidence in his organizer. It's possible that even he had no idea the key was hiding a knife blade inside.
</line><line>Franziska:
But if that's true... ...then only someone who knew about the key to knife trick... ...could have killed Mr. Faraday!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even among law enforcement, this key was top secret... We're looking for someone who knew even more about the key than even Mr. Faraday... Meaning that the only person it could be is the one who sent the key in the first place... The <textEffects>Great Thief Yatagarasu</textEffects>!
</line><line>Franziska:
! .........Then maybe Mr. Rell really was the Yatagarasu... ...and he was the one who killed Mr. Faraday. Isn't that one possible scenario?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, not really... Especially since Mr. Faraday... ...was absolutely convinced that Mr. Rell was not the Yatagarasu. Besides, as Detective Badd said earlier...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
But... when we questioned Rell about what was sent along with the white card... ...Rell had no idea what it was.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
I see... Alright then, I guess the person who knows the trick behind this key... ...is someone else, and that person is the real Yatagarasu.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems that this key is truly the key to solving this case.

<line><i>(Examine all evidences leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's odd. We're short one piece of evidence. And the piece that's missing is the <textEffects>surveillance video</textEffects> that was played in court!
</line><line>Franziska:
The <textEffects>surveillance video</textEffects>...? How could a piece of evidence just disappear? Where did it go?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The video showing the moment in which Mr. Rell committed the murder... Where could it have gone indeed!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Are you done with your inspection of the evidence?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm finished. However, Your Honor, I am missing a single piece of prosecutorial evidence.
</line><line>Franziska:
Your Honor... Were you derelict in your duties?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!? No! I dare not lick my duties! What do you take me for!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, Your Honor. The most important piece of evidence in today's trial... ...the <textEffects>surveillance video</textEffects>, is not amongst the evidence you laid out for me.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But I brought Mr. Faraday's whole bag with me from the crime scene. Maybe the tape is still somewhere at the crime scene...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. <textEffects>(There's something wrong here... Something about this missing piece of evidence... It would appear that for me to find the answers I seek... ...I will have to pay another visit to the scene of the crime, Defendant Lobby No. 2!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>September 10, 6:00 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2</textEffects></center>
<line>Edgeworth:
Hm? That's Detective Badd... but who is he with...?
</line><line>Franziska:
I've never seen that officer before.
</line><line>Badd:
So, did you find it...?
</line><line>???:
No, not yet, and I've looked everywhere.
</line><line>Badd:
I see... Well, then... please continue with the search...
</line><line>???:
Understood. I'll continue the search. Heh. So you're the one running this show. Prosecutors like you shouldn't even be allowed at crime scenes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How dare you!? Just who do you think you are...!? What was that all about, and who was that man just now!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Whoever he was, I've never seen a more impudent officer in my life.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Does he even know that we're standing right here behind him?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
.........I know you're standing right behind me. What do you want... kids?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Franziska:
It looks like you were paying attention after all.
</line><line>Badd:
...Of course I was. ...I have eyes... in the back of my head...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ah, so that mirror isn't for vanity's sake... It's for him to keep an eye out on who or what is behind him at all times.)</textEffects> So tell me, Detective Badd, who was that rude man just now?
</line><line>Badd:
...The guy came here... from the Republic of Zheng Fa to study... He's Agent Lang. He's trying everything he can... to revive the lost honor of his family... He's traveling the world... to study different philosophies of detainment... from scratch...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By visiting various police departments around the world? He has a lot of dedication.
</line><line>Badd:
He's still just a rookie cop... but I sense a strong grudge of some sort from him. The guy's... more useful than Gumshoe. .........Even if he is rude.
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, he sure has a lot of guts to come to this country and give prosecutors a hard time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I agree, however, I can think of one young lady that statement also applies to.)</textEffects> Anyway, what was that agent looking for, Detective Badd?
</line><line>Franziska:
Earlier, that little girl was poking around in Lobby No. 1 as well.
</line><line>Badd:
...Like I said before, it's got nothing to do with the two of you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I highly doubt that it has nothing to do with me.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Fine, if this is the game I must play, then I will take this opportunity... ...to draw out what he's been hiding and what happened in this room straight from him.)</textEffects>

Detective Badd. I ask that you please testify once more... ...about what happened in Lobby No. 2 and what you experienced in Lobby No. 1.
</line><line>Badd:
...My answer is still the same. And this... is the last time I'm going to do this...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's fine, because I only need this one last time to clear everything up. <textEffects>(And find the truth behind this case!)</textEffects>

...I heard the gunshot... right before the trial was about to reconvene.
When we heard it, Yew and I immediately dashed out into the hallway together!
I saw Gumshoe goofing around there... and then we all ran in to Lobby No. 2.

<hr />
<line>Franziska:
It sounds like the exact same story he told us before...

Indeed. However, I feel that we have yet to draw out all the information that we can.

<line>Edgeworth:
It sounds exactly like what Detective Badd told us before, however...
</line><line>Franziska:
Is there something in particular we should be asking the detective about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There just might be... <textEffects>(No one knew that the knife is actually the Yatagarasu's Key... Reflecting on that... ...perhaps there are other things that we know now, but Detective Badd doesn't yet. Yes, that should be my angle of attack!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Detective Badd... Does this balloon fragment remind you of anything?
</line><line>Badd:
...It's the same color... as the one Kay was holding...
</line><line>Franziska:
Oh? So you knew about that girl's balloon?
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah... I was sitting with her up in the gallery... During the recess... just before we split up, I filled that balloon up for her.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, as you may have already surmised, this piece did indeed come from Kay's balloon.
</line><line>Badd:
So? What about the balloon...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wonder if you might remember hearing this balloon pop at some point?
</line><line>Badd:
...What are you getting at?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... This fragment was found in the hallway, right in front of Lobby No. 2. Furthermore... ...it was the sound of this balloon popping that the judge mistook as a gunshot.
</line><line>Badd:
...Oh? So the sound that the judge heard... was not actually a gunshot, huh...
</line><line>Franziska:
On top of that, His Honor said that he heard the balloon pop... ...about 20 minutes before the trial was to reconvene.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, which means that His Honor heard the balloon pop in the hallway... ...when you were in Lobby No. 1, Detective Badd! And if you were in Lobby No. 1 at that time... ...you were close enough that you should have heard the balloon popping as well!
</line><line>Badd:
...So?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Don't give me a "So?"!
</line><line>Franziska:
We just proved that there is a flaw in your testimony!
</line><line>Badd:
The cracking of the truth... is louder than the sound of your sweet naïveté cracking... And since you kids don't seem to know, let me fill you in on something! Did you ever stop to think why the doors and walls of this place seem so rugged? That's because they were designed to keep secrets from being leaked!
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What... is that supposed to mean!?
</line><line>Badd:
...The doors and walls are super thick... the windowpanes are double-layered... To top it all off... even the curtains are made of a special sound-absorbing material.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! Then, you mean...!?
</line><line>Badd:
Since I was shut up inside Lobby No. 1, there was no way I could've heard that sound!
</line><line>Franziska:
N-No!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! <textEffects>(I knew that's what he was going to say!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Then that means that scruff-face's testimony is completely useless! If the rooms are soundproof, then of course he wouldn't hear any sign of a struggle!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nnghooooh!
</line><line>Badd:
...That's also why it's only natural... ...that I didn't hear the balloon popping... ...Now do you get it... kids?
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles! I thought WE were supposed to be the ones finding flaws in his logic... ...not the other way around!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The... other way around...? <textEffects>(It's not possible to hear the sound of a balloon popping if one were in Lobby No. 1. However, if we examine this situation in reverse... ...a person standing in the hallway should not be able to hear the real gunshot either. And yet, Detective Gumshoe claims to have heard it while he was standing in the hallway.)</textEffects> Detective Badd... If that is the case, how exactly did you hear the gunshot?
</line><line>Badd:
...What do you mean, "how"...? I just did...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... It would appear... ...that you have yet to realize the contradiction in your own words.
</line><line>Badd:
...Oh? How so...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If the rooms are as soundproof as you say they are... ...then how did the sound of the gunshot enter your ears?
</line><line>Badd:
...! I see what you mean... I guess I'm more out of it... from Faraday's murder than I had thought...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
Which means what, exactly, Miles!? In the end, what does it all boil down to!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It boils down to this: There must be a reason... ...as to how detectives Badd and Gumshoe heard a gunshot they theoretically couldn't have.
</line><line>Franziska:
It looked like we need to examine the state of the crime scene again, huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! <textEffects>(The state of the crime scene...? Wait! Can it be...!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
...It's that ultra-strong <textEffects>perfume</textEffects> Yew wears...

Where did it go?
</line>
<hr />

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's simply not possible for the killer to have escaped through barred windows... ...and yet, the fragrance of the perfume managed to escape from Defendant Lobby No. 1. Of course! Incorporeal things ccan move freely through these <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Open windows - The criminal couldn&#39;t have made it through, but what about incorporeal things?">open, barred windows</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Open windows - The criminal couldn't have made it through, but what about incorporeal things?)</textEffects></span>!)</span>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now then, what else besides a smell can go both in and out of an open, barred window...? The answer... is <span style="color:#E16935">sound</textEffects>! So, no matter how careful the killer was, if the windows were open, the jig would be up. And since the windows in both Defendant Lobby No. 1 and the hallway were open... ...that explains how <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Gunshot could be heard - Windows were open, so the gunshot could be heard, but where did it originate from?">the sound of a gunshot could be heard</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Gunshot could be heard - Windows were open, so the gunshot could be heard, but where did it originate from?)</textEffects></span> in both locations!)</span>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The missing piece of evidence is a video... ...that shows the moment in which Mr. Rell killed the Embassy staff member. The sound of the gunshot left quite an impression on me when it was played during the trial. The video should have been returned to Mr. Faraday's evidence bag for the recess... ...and brought back here. If it disappeared after that time... ...then it's possible that the tape is still here in this room. Eureka! The evidence that the missing evidence created for me... ...is the gunshot sound that no one should've been able to hear in the first place!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
Miles... What have you been thinking about? Stop wasting time thinking, and let's start looking again!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's not a waste of time to think, for I have figured out where we should look.
</line><line>Franziska:
And where would that be!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe we should examine... the television!
</line><line>Badd:
The TV...? ...Well, you kids have fun... Go ahead and examine whatever you like...

<line>Edgeworth:
If the door and windows to the crime scene, namely, this room that we're in, were closed... ...the killer could've used the gun and no one would've been the wiser.
</line><line>Franziska:
That's true. This courthouse does seem to be well-designed for such a thing, as it were.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, what happened in reality was... ...Detective Gumshoe, Detective Badd, and Ms. Yew... All three of them heard the gunshot.
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, the windows in Lobby No. 1, No. 2, and the hallway were open... ...so naturally the people in those locations could hear it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, but then, why would the criminal open the window in the first place?
</line><line>Franziska:
...To allow the gunshot to be heard... I suppose.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Correct. That's the only logical conclusion we can draw from this.
</line><line>Franziska:
But why was that necessary in the first place? I want a real answer, Miles! I demand satisfaction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. I believe that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of a certain fact. <textEffects>(What was it that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The killer wanted to fabricate the time of death to their precise wishes! And they used the gunshot in the surveillance video to do so!
</line><line>Franziska:
! So that's why the tape was left running!
</line><line>Badd:
You mean... the gunshoe I heard... was from this video!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Which means that the murders really occurred at an earlier time than we thought!
</line><line>Badd:
..................!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It must have been during the recess, but before Detective Gumshoe was on guard duty. Someone who has no alibi for that time period... ...and planned this crime out in advance... That person is the real killer...!)</textEffects>

Ms. Yew is asking for you. She's in the courtroom. She says that she's identified the murderer, but that she wants to clarify something...
</line><line>Franziska:
It looks like Ms. Yew is still investigating something.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood. Please tell her that I will be right over.
</line><line>Badd:
...I'll come along. I want to hear what she has to say...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It would appear that the time has come... to uncover the truth!

Kay... What are you doing here?

Oh, hello, mister! I'm still investigating!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But the object you're looking for has already...

</line><line>Badd:
Kay... don't mind him... Please continue with your investigation...
</line><line>Kay:
OK! You got it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Detective Badd, haven't we already found what you were looking for?
</line><line>Kay:
If it means I can keep her in the dark just a little longer... any little task will do.
</line><line>Franziska:
Oh? You're more sympathetic than I thought.
</line><line>Badd:
.........Hmph...
</line><line>Yew:
I've been waiting for you, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I've also been waiting... for the moment in which we can finally lay this case to rest.
</line><line>Yew:
...Phwwh! Ahahahahaha! "The moment in which we can finally lay this case to rest"? Wasn't that when we placed Detective Gumshoe under arrest...? Phwwwwwh. I think we've more than solved this case already... Phwwwwhhkkk... Don't you?
</line><line>Franziska:
We'll see. It all depends on whether or not your logic holds.
</line><line>Yew:
Oh, I see we even have a viewer in the gallery! And... why, even Mr. Badd is here!
</line><line>Franziska:
A... A viewer in the gallery!? I'm hardly just a by-stander!
</line><line>Badd:
...I have a duty... to see this case through to the end... No matter how it turns out...
</line><line>Yew:
.........Oh? Is that right? Anyway... I thought you might like to hear what I've slaved away to find out. I've taken statements on every single person's movements... ...during the time when our suspect was in the hallway. I also confirmed that there is no possible route of escape from Lobby No. 2. Therefore, the killer must without a doubt be... Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's all you have?
</line><line>Yew:
Yeah, that's all there is to my conclusion, and this case!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, but I beg to differ. In a trial, there is always time for a rebuttal, and we ARE standing in a court of law. It'd be more than appropriate to follow the rules of court, in this case, don't you think?
</line><line>Yew:
Phwwh... Ahahahahahaha! How absolutely like a rookie to think such a thing. But alright... I'll play along and give you a proper testimony.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If my logic is correct, then I've already won. All I have to do now is to prove it... by showing who the real killer is!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Ms. Yew's Argument --</textEffects></center>
<line>Yew:
Everyone, sans the suspect, has an alibi for when the gun went off.
Furthermore, the areas around the crime scene have all been thoroughly investigated, right?
I also confirmed that there is no possible escape route from Lobby No. 2.
Which leaves us with one unshakable conclusion, that Detective Gumshoe is the killer.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Yew:
Phwwwh... Now that you have your testimony. I expect a good rebuttal, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmph, but of course. <textEffects>(There is no need to confront her logic head on right now. I should instead focus on drawing out any trump cards she has up her sleeve.)</textEffects>

<textEffects>(Hmm... I suppose we've really reached the end now. I already have my trump card ready. All that remains is to play it! But before I do... ...I think I should inquire into a little something about her argument.)</textEffects> You said earlier that you confirmed the alibis of every person other than the suspect. However, I don't recall either Franziska or myself speaking with you about the subject.
</line><line>Yew:
Ah, but there were witnesses. For you, there is your mentor who gave you an alibi.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see...
</line><line>Yew:
As for the little missy... Phwwwwh... She came to the courthouse during the recess... ...phwwh... and was stopped by a security guard... at the door to the hallway... She gave him quite a whipping for that, or so I heard.
</line><line>Franziska:
...! I'm the daughter of Manfred von Karma. And I will not be forcibly stopped by a guard, or a bailiff, or anyone else!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wait, so basically, the only reason Franziska bothered to show up today... ...was because she found out that I was to be the replacement prosecutor...?)</textEffects> By the way, Ms. Yew... ...what about everyone's alibis before Detective Gumshoe was assigned to guard duty?
</line><line>Yew:
What about them?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Have you looked into what people were doing during that span of time?
</line><line>Yew:
Phwwwh... What kind of idiot do you take me for? It doesn't matter when the killer went into Lobby No. 2. From the time we heard the gunshot... ...to the time Mr. Badd and I arrived on the scene as we dashed from Lobby No. 1... ...the only person who could've committed the crime was Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, let's talk about when you and Detective Badd heard that gunshot, shall we? I suppose that if we go by your logic, then Detective Gumshoe is the only one. However, what if the crime had occurred... ...at an entirely different time than when that gunshot you heard went off? What then?
</line><line>Yew:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That gunshot was a trap meant to manipulate our perception of when the crime took place
</line><line>Yew:

</line><line>Yew:
Sadly, your explanation is very lacking, Edgeworth. <textEffects>The gunshot we heard in Lobby No. 1... Care to explain how that could've been fabricated?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Yew:
That tape...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, it's exactly what you think it is. This is the surveillance tape of Mr. Rell the prosecution presented in today's trial. This was found loaded in the video player in Lobby No. 2... ...that was connected to the large television that had its volume turned all the way up.
</line><line>Yew:
You can't honestly mean that the sound we heard was the gunshot in the video...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, but I do. Which leads me to my next point. The murders occurred much earlier than when anyone heard the "gunshot"!
</line><line>Yew:
...!
</line><line>Badd:
...That's the only thing I can think of, too...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
After committing double homicide... ...the killer took the surveillance video out from Mr. Faraday's evidence bag... ...turned the television's volume all the way up, and left the video to play. If played from the beginning, it would take 30 minutes for the gunshot sound to come on. And since we now know that this method of time manipulation is possible... ...it opens up the possibility that the killer is someone other than Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Yew:

</line><line>Yew:
Sounds from a television doesn't amount to much here. But of course, Mr. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and Little Miss von Karma... ...already knew that much from the very beginning, right?
</line><line>Franziska:
O-Of course we knew! Didn't we, Miles!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, of course. We know about the soundproof quality of this courthouse's rooms. <textEffects>(Of course, I'm not about to admit we had no idea until only a little while ago...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Yew:
That's right, and if the rooms are soundproof, then we should not have been able to hear it. And yet, we heard the gunshot clear as day!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........And?
</line><line>Yew:
A-And!? Th-That's it, end of story!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... But it's not.
</line><line>Yew:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How should I explain why she was able to hear a gunshot from a soundproof room?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
There is, actually, one common point between Lobby No. 1 and Lobby No. 2. And it is that despite the fact that both rooms have air conditioners installed... ...a window was open in each!
</line><line>Yew:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, we know that the window in Lobby No. 2 was opened by the killer... ...however, a window in Lobby No. 1 was also opened.
</line><line>Yew:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. It was no mere coincidence, I assure you. <textEffects>(Why was the window opened in Lobby No. 1? The answer is that a certain person did something to cause the window to be opened. And the person who triggered that action... that person is the real guilty party! The real killer in this double murder is...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Calisto Yew! I hereby formally indict you of the murder of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell!
</line><line>Badd:
...!
</line><line>Franziska:
What!?
</line><line>Yew:
Y... You indict... me!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Are you serious, Miles!? Why do you think she is the killer...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't understand her motive just yet... ...but of course I'm serious. Because she is the only one who could've done it. Well, Ms. Yew. Do you still feel like laughing now?
</line><line>Yew:
Ha, hahaha... Of course I do, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! <textEffects>(My argument must not be tight enough yet...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Yew:
Although, I never thought things would spiral into this. But I'll have you know I'm enjoying this dance... quite a bit! I guess this means it's time for my own rebuttal now, right?

It sounds like the exact same story he told us before...

<line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure you've seen this before, haven't you, Ms. Yew?
</line><line>Yew:
Ahah! Edgeworth! I never knew you were into wearing that kind of perfume! It's not exactly what I'D recommend for boys, you know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Th-This isn't mine!
</line><line>Franziska:
That's right, it's mine. And I received it from Detective Badd, you see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, you can pretend all you like, but we know at least this much for sure! That this bottle of perfume was given to Detective Badd by you!
</line><line>Yew:
Kphwwh... Ahahahahahaha! Because it gets really strong, really fast! So? What about the perfume?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
While you were in Lobby No. 1, you made a big show of spilling some of this perfume. That's according to Detective Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
.........
</line><line>Yew:
...Phwwwwh. Oh, I know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You also knew that if you spilled it, he would naturally move to open a window!

</line><line>Yew:
Come now, I've already told you that's all just a big coincidence. After we opened the window in Lobby No. 1, I just left it open, you know? So maybe it was just dumb luck that we heard the gunshot through the window!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The timing of when you were going to spill the perfume is something you could control. And the most important fact about this case is when people were made to hear the shot. Furthermore, it would've been pointless if you didn't have an alibi for yourself at the time!
</line><line>Badd:
! You mean...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, you were the one who called Detective Badd into Lobby No. 1... ...when you saw him bring Detective Gumshoe into the hallway. Is that correct?
</line><line>Yew:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All of today's premeditated events could only have been thought up by you, Ms. Yew!
</line><line>Yew:
...Grr! ...Ha, hahaha. You accuse me of murder on the fact that I spilled a little perfume. Well, allow me to say this much. I couldn't have killed Mr. Faraday.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would you care to testify as to why?
</line><line>Yew:
Hahahahaha... Look, I've had a lot of fun today, really. ...But I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Why It Couldn't Be Me --</textEffects></center>
<line>Yew:
Accusing someone of murder over a spilled bottle of perfume is a bit over the top.
But I suppose forgery of evidence is to be expected of a disciple of Von Karma.
In any case, it simply could not have been me who killed Mr. Faraday.
After all, I don't even know where the knife that was used to kill him came from.

<line>Franziska:
Miles, her testimony... is flawless.

<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, I wonder if you might take a look at this photo for me? This is a picture of the <textEffects>key</textEffects> the Yatagarasu sent to the police. However, while it may look like a key at first glance... ...it, in fact, has the secret ability to transform into a <textEffects>knife</textEffects>.

You knew that the key was inside Mr. Faraday's bag, did you not?
</line><line>Yew:
.........Yes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, with the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> alone, it's more than possible to kill Mr. Faraday!
</line><line>Yew:

Do you understand now? Just knowing of the existence of the Yatagarasu's Key...

I still haven't had a good look at it. Showing it to me from that far away -- you could be lying for all I know!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You would, even now, still feign ignorance!?
</line><line>Yew:
Ahah! I'm not feigning anything! Buy we can't have you accusing me of a crime with false evidence, now can we? I mean, Mr. von Karma... I've heard some very... interesting rumors about him.
</line><line>Franziska:
Arngh! Are you mocking my papa!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't you dare sully the good name of my mentor! Now take a good look! This piece of evidence is more than real.
</line><line>Yew:
...Wow, who knew there was such a trick to this thing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you satisfied now? But, of course, you knew from the very beginning, didn't you? You knew that the <textEffects>knife</textEffects> and the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> are one and the same! Otherwise, someone like you, who isn't a member of law enforcement, and who... ...would never have been privy to this trick, would have never known about it to begin with!
</line><line>Yew:
.........!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Furthermore, the <textEffects>something</textEffects> that the Yatagarasu sent to the police... How did you have knowledge as to what it was?
</line><line>Yew:
Phwwh... Phwwwwwh... Actually, I heard it from Mr. Faraday. Just before he dragged Mr. Rell off, he told me. Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! He also told me about the key turning into a knife at that time. But he didn't tell me about how the key actually transforms...

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, that is also impossible. Because Detective Badd didn't know about the knife aspect either!
</line><line>Yew:
...Tchhhh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What would've been highly classified information, even with the police force... ...and is something that even the lead detective on the case didn't know... Why would Mr. Faraday have felt the need to share such information with the opposition?
</line><line>Yew:
Kphwwwh... Ahahahahaha! Yeah, I guess he wouldn't have much of a reason to... Phwwwwh. Looks like I gave a pretty lame excuse, huh... Phwwwwh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How can you laugh at a time like this...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
She probably just realized the flaw in her logic, and is actually in a panic over it. But that's not something we need to concern ourselves with.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm......... I suppose you're right. Ms. Yew. I'd like to state that I also know how you know the real nature of the knife.
</line><line>Yew:
Heh heh heh... Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Do you know? Well why don't you put your money where your mouth is and show me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh, I will, and I'll wipe that smile off your face by the time we're through! <textEffects>(This is it, the moment of truth. The secret behind the Yatagarasu's Key... Only one person would have had knowledge of it from the get-go!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Who would know from the start that the Yatagarasu's Key could change into a knife?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
There is only one person who would've known about the dual nature of the key.
</line><line>Yew:
...Ahah. And that is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that is, the person who sent the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> to the police...! That is to say, the <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects> herself!
</line><line>Yew:
..................
</line><line>Franziska:
Are you saying that this lawyer is the Great Thief <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew. You used Mr. Rell to lure Mr. Faraday into a trap, didn't you? You, who profess to bear a grudge against criminals, why!? Why do something like this!?
</line><line>Yew:
........................Phwwh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........?
</line><line>Yew:
Hee... Hee hee hee... hee hee... hee hee....... hee hee hee hee hee! ...Ahah! Ahahaha! Ahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha......... .........Who would've thought... that you.................. ...a stupid rookie prosecutor... would see through me...? You're sending the biggest chill down my spine right now, Edgeworth! This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than when I sneak into someplace...
</line><line>Badd:
Yew! ...You...! You killed Faraday...!? Why...? Answer me! Calisto Yew!
</line><line>Yew:
.........Ahah! Calisto Yew... huh... That's not my real name. Becuase my real identity is, yes... the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Yew:
Let me tell you something, Edgeworth. Mr. Faraday... was one difficult man to deal with. For you see... he had discovered my true identity. Which is why I had to erase him from the world of law. I made Rell an offer: an acquittal for a little favoe in return. All he had to do was accuse Mr. Faraday of being the Yatagarasu in court. But once we entered the recess, Rell was dragged off by Mr. Faraday... ...which threw my plan into a complete mess. I chased after them, and eavesdropped on them through a crack in the door. That Rell caves to only two things, money and authority, just as all thugs do. I feared my plan was going to be ruined if Mr. Faraday held onto Rell any longer. Plus, if I had let them continue on the way they were, I would've been found out. That's why I had no choice... I had to kill them both!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But didn't you say that you despised criminals!?
</line><line>Yew:
...Phwwh. But do I really...?
</line><line>Badd:
You...! Have you forgotten... about the KG-8 Incident, too...!?
</line><line>Yew:
.........Maybe.
</line><line>Franziska:
What sort of woman would--!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So then, was it your plan to kill Mr. Faraday with the very "evidence" that you sent!?
</line><line>Yew:
Ha ha... Well, I had a good idea of what Mr. Faraday was going to do. I anticipated that Mr. Faraday was going to prove that Rell wasn't Yatagarasu... ...by using this <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> as evidence, and that he would bring it with him. Which is why I thought to use the knife portion. With a weapon as well-disguised as this, no one would be the wiser... Because who in their right mind would think something like this could be a weapon? I casually entered Lobby No. 2 on the pretext that I had to talk with Mr. Faraday. And in order to get in with him, I pretended to be worried about something. He then let me hold the Yatagarasu's Key, just like that. He never noticed that I had changed the key into a knife inside that plastic bag... ...and he didn't have the chance to take note of the knife that took his life.
</line><line>Badd:
...! How could you kill him......!?
</line><line>Yew:
I knew him for a long time, you know? At the very least, I thought to give him a quick and painless death.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But if you killed Mr. Faraday first, there was no need for you to kill Mr. Rell as well!
</line><line>Yew:
I believe I mentioned why when we were placing Detective Gumshoe under arrest. Something about "having accidentally created an eye-witness"...? And how that led the killer to think about setting them up as though they'd killed each other.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! Then the trick with the surveillance tape...!
</line><line>Yew:
Yes... I hadn't actually planned to use a gun. The risk was too high that I'd be caught. However, that's when I remembered the existence of that surveillance tape. Which is why I had Rell help me set up the crime scene... ...and after all was said and done, I rewarded him for all his hard work with a bullet.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? How could you... How could you betray a client!?
</line><line>Yew:
Ahahahaha! Client? If you want to talk about who was a client of whose first, it was me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
?
</line><line>Yew:
I was the client in the murder of the Cohdopian Embassy staff member, Deid Mann!
</line><line>Badd:
Y.........! You... ordered a hit job!?
</line><line>Yew:
Ha ha ha... You still haven't figured it out, Mr. Badd? I had Deid Mann killed because he was about to give away info about the smuggling ring. Now , who exactly do you think would benefit from such an assassination?
</line><line>Badd:
I-It can't be.........! Yew... You're...!
</line><line>Yew:
That's right... I'm a member of the smuggling ring.
</line><line>Badd:
Wh--!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How could this...!?
</line><line>Badd:
You don't mean... you're working with Manny Coachen, too, do you?
</line><line>Yew:
Ahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahah! Maybe, maybe not. Guess you'll never know.
</line><line>Franziska:
The Yatagarasu claims to be noble, but you're just another cold-blooded murderer!
</line><line>Yew:
Ahah! Ahahahahahahaha! That's right, little girl. The Yatagarasu is just another killer!
</line><line>Badd:
Be quiet! Yew...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yatagarasu! You can run from the law, but you'll never escape it.
</line><line>Yew:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So just humbly accept the judgement of this court!
</line><line>Yew:
.................. Ha ha ha... Hey, Edgeworth. Did you know? The Yatagarasu has <textEffects>three legs</textEffects>. Do you know why that is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Yew:
Ha ha! No? Well, let me tell you. It means that the Yatagarasu has more than one razor-sharp way to do her work.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Yew:
You really are too naïve, Edgeworth. You even handed the <textEffects>Yatagarasu's Key</textEffects> right to me without a second thought. Everything may not have gone according to plan, but I'll still gladly take it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh...! You mean...!? The key was your real target!?
</line><line>Yew:
*sigh* ...And even after I gave you such great advice... Didn't I tell you to "always keep a good eye on a criminal"......... ...or you may regret what comes of your negligence!
</line><line>Badd:
You two! Get down!
</line><line>Franziska:
Eek...! Aaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh! <textEffects>(My body... I can't move...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hey mister! To your right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Badd:
Yeeeeeew!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you alright, Franziska!?
</line><line>Franziska:
.........! I-I'm perfectly fine, Miles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Her voice is shaking... But it looks like she's unharmed.)</textEffects> Hm...? Where did Kay go?&#160;! That's a gunshot...!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>September 10, 7:00 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3</textEffects></center>
<line>Badd:
...Sorry, but it looks like she got away. I called the precinct... They should have a perimeter set up soon...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Badd! Are you alright!? I heard a gunshot...
</line><line>Badd:
I'm OK... Just got... another hole in my jacket...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He may say he's fine, but he looks quite shaken...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
But more importantly, boy... I mean, Mr. Edgeworth, Ms. von Karma... ...are you two hurt?
</line><line>Franziska:
! I... I'm absolutely fine!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm also alright... thanks to Kay.
</line><line>Badd:
! Speaking of Kay... where is she?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... I don't know. She just sort of... disappeared.
</line><line>Badd:
Hmm... I'll go look for her... Oh, and... hey, Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir!
</line><line>Badd:
...I'm sorry I doubted you...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't worry, sir! It's not your fault! I... Well, I lied to you guys too, after all!
</line><line>Badd:
I heard about what happened... from Kay... Lying while giving testimony is still unforgivable... ...but in this case... you were protecting Kay and her feelings. Looks like you just might have what it takes to be a real detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
!
</line><line>Badd:
Now, don't you ever lose that detective's spirit, OK!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-You got it, pops!
</line><line>Franziska:
"Pops"...? Watched one too many detective dramas recently, have we?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Way to single-handedly destroy the cheery atmosphere with one snarky comment.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
...I should get back to the investigation. I swear... I'll catch Yew if it's the last thing I do...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Be careful, Detective Badd, and take care.
</line><line>Badd:
Thanks. Well, I'm off... Maybe we'll run into each other again someday.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm... So, uh... Thanks a bunch, pal! You're the best! You really did find out the truth behind everything!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, well... I'm glad we solved everything before you were taken to prison.
</line><line>Judge:
I can't believe how much trouble I caused you with my testimony, Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah, it was no problem, really! Ha ha ha! I mean, I lied, too, so I didn't help anything! It's really not your fault, Your Honor!
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, even if we didn't have His Honor's testimony... ...I think that lawyer would've found another way to get you convicted on her behalf.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... I can't believe I was about to get fired during my first week as a detective!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Well, so long as you're not fired... ...you should work hard, give all that you have, and perform your duties well. ...Oh, and one more thing. Kay left a present for you with me.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
She did? Ooh! What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What was it that Kay left for me -- the proof of their friendship...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He only noticed just now...? Was his mind not present when we discussed her earlier...!?)</textEffects> Detective Badd left to go search for her earlier. Maybe you should go join him.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah! You betcha, pal! I'm gonna go help him! Oh! But first...! You know what, pal...? Actually, I guess I shouldn't be so rude to you anymore, huh? I'm gonna stick right by your side from now on, Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. <textEffects>(I sense nothing but a most troublesome relationship from that ominous statement.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
We should go home too, Miles. We have to hurry and report what has happened to Papa!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agreed. Well, I'm afraid we must be going now, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Roger, sir! And don't you worry! I'll investigate the next case we're on real well!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll, um... be counting on you. <textEffects>(The scent of trouble is definitely in the air...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Thus, like a bad dream, my first outing at court came to a disturbing end. A few months later... ...I was finally able to properly stand in court as a prosecutor... ...but the detective in charge of the investigation was, as I dreaded, Detective Gumshoe. After that, he became my direct subordinate... I have tried, but words fail to describe the immeasurable suffering he has caused me. But I suppose that's just how things are. As for the little girl who suddenly disappeared... She's now..................
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
..................
</line><line>Kay:
So? Do you remember now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... I remember everything. Kay... It's been a while.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay! You sure grew up a lot!
</line><line>Kay:
Of course! But thank goodness! I thought you two had totally forgotten about me!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You know, I was really worried about you after all that! Where have you been all this time?
</line><line>Kay:
Eheheh! Gummy, I didn't know you cared! After my father died, I went to go live with my mother's relatives. They lived really far away, so I wasn't really able to come back here all that much.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh, is that what happened...? Well, I'm just glad you're alright!
</line><line>Kay:
Eheheh! So, does it all make sense now?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You betcha it does!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, you know what? I was going through my father's bookshelves recently, and...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, there are still a number of things that don't make sense, Kay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First of all, why did you come all this way to see me? And second... Why are you calling yourself the <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects>? The Yatagarasu is Calisto Yew... the woman who killed your father.
</line><line>Kay:
No, you're wrong. The real Yatagarasu... was my father!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Faraday was the Yatagarasu...?
</line><line>Kay:
Like I said, I was going through my father's bookshelf recently... ...and I found a secret diary hidden among his books. "I have no regrets in choosing to walk the path of the Yatagarasu." That was written in his diary, and that's how I know for sure!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........But that's... That's impossible!
</line><line>Kay:
What's with that look? You don't believe me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It wasn't just the expression on my face, I clearly said it was impossible just now.
</line><line>Kay:
Alright, then. How do you explain this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It's a way of disarming any security system of the user's choosing...!?
</line><line>Kay:
Yup! That's <textEffects>Little Thief</textEffects>! Truth be told, this is the Yatagarasu's greatest secret. And this little gizmo was used by my father!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wooooow! Mr. Faraday wasn't just a great prosecutor, he was really a great thief, huh!?
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, my father worked really hard to steal the truth! But he was killed... and the Yatagarasu was no more. ...But despite that, the Yatagarasu has been spotted again recently!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Someone other than you!?
</line><line>Kay:
Here, Mr. Edgeworth... Take a look at this article.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! The Yatagarasu sent the Embassy... a calling card?
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, meaning this person's a fake! I'm almost certain... that Calisto Yew lady is behind this. Because the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a gaudy card out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But the Yatagarasu did send a white card along with anything to be publicized. <textEffects>(...That's what Detective Badd told me seven years ago, if memory serves.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Well, as soon as I heard the news, I got all wound up, and I knew I couldn't just let it go. So I searched you out... so that I could obtain the truth behind the Yatagarasu. Because if anyone can help me find it, I figured it's you, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you're saying that I have your father's and Ms. Yew's identities backwards?
</line><line>Kay:
Yes, because the real Yatagarasu is noble to the end! And I want to revive the real, noble Yatagarasu! If I don't... my father will never be able to rest in peace.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay... you're so honorable! I don't care what anyone else thinks, I'll always be here to cheer you on, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Even if you are honorable, a thief is a thief. And if you are plotting to commit a crime, then I'm afraid I can't be complicit.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth... Oonngh... You guys are not making it easy for me! Who am I supposed to support now!?
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... What I want from you is not to steal something. What I want is the arrest of that evil woman.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That evil woman... You mean Calisto Yew?
</line><line>Kay:
I think it's too hard for me to catch her all by myself. But I thought that since you were able to expose her for who she is, then maybe... Please, Mr. Edgeworth! Won't you help me!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. Come to think of it, I do believe I owe you.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh...? Owe me for what?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When Ms. Yew made her escape, it was you who saved my life. Furthermore, you helped me with the investigation today. I am not so rude as to leave favors un-repaid.
</line><line>Kay:
Th-Then you mean!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... That case has been weighing down my soul ever since that fateful day. Perhaps the time has come to settle things once and for all. If you don't intend to sully your hands in a crime... then I believe I can help you.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yay, Mr. Edgeworth, siiiiiiir! Isn't that great, Kay!?
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, it sure is, Gummy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even though he had completely forgotten about her until just now... Arngh... What is with their chummy relationship...!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The Great Thief <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects>... After all that time, the true identity of the thief sank back into the darkness. Byrne Faraday, Calisto Yew... and Kay Faraday. The phantasmagorically changing identity of the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and the Yatagarasu's real goal... It would all come to light the day after I made that promise to Kay.
