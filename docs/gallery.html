            <h2>2018</h2>
            <p>Not only have I made digital art, but also physical art on pencil and paper! However, I preferred the latter during my high school years until the COVID-19 pandemic hit, which was when I decided to draw digital art to pass the time.</p>

            <h2>2019</h2>
            <p>I downloaded Procreate on my iPhone on July 31, 2019, and it has been my favorite art source ever since. I still draw pictures with this software in my free time today.</p>

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I experimented with another form of digital art on my Windows laptop called Paint 3D. I mainly drew VOCALOID characters as popsicles with gumball eyes. Some of the characters were 3D-printed at Penn State Wilkes-Barre the next year!</p>

            <h2>2022-present</h2>
        <p>After receiving a 3D pen as a Christmas gift in 2021, I loved it so much that I would go on to post many of my creations on Instagram. I also took a Photoshop class last semester, and I have been using Photoshop in my free time ever since.</p>
