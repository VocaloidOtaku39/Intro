            <h2>In a nutshell</h2>
            
            <p>I am Alyssa Hopple, a junior at Penn State University. As a Digital Arts, Media, and Technology major, I spent my first two years of college at <a href="https://wilkesbarre.psu.edu/">Penn State Wilkes-Barre</a>, which is twenty minutes from my home in that city. Last month I moved into Behrend to make the dream of becoming a video game designer come true!</p>
