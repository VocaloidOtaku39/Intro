<line>April:
Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.
</line><line>April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Here we go again...)</textEffects> Please, you're scaring the security guard.
</line><line>April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)</textEffects>

Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.

YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?

Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!

Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.

Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.
</line><line>Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?
</line><line>Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.
</line><line>Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!

So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!

Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!

<textEffects>(What the...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. <textEffects>("Inquirably"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is this guy's problem!)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What a fruitcake!)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What does he mean by that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
No matter. So, what business does a "mighty" lawyer have with a man such as myself?

It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?

Umm... huh? A lawyer?

No, my feeble friend. A "mere" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!

<textEffects>(Wh-what!?)</textEffects> Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... <textEffects>(He... he punched me!)</textEffects>

Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!

What...?

Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.
</line><line>White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!

<line>Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(15 years...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The name on the back of those photographs!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that's the connection!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?
</line><line>Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.

Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?

Just what are you insinuating?

Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...?

Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow.
</line><line>Interphone:
<textEffects>[What's this about?]</textEffects>
</line><line>White:
The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify.
</line><line>Interphone:
<textEffects>[What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?]</textEffects>

Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent!

<textEffects>[What? What man?]</textEffects>

<line>White:
... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.
</line><line>Phoenix:
How dare you!
</line><line>White:
I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.

<line>Phoenix:
I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea.
</line><line>Maya:
... Wright! Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention.
</line><line>Maya:
Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places.
</line><line>Maya:
What? You mean, you...?

I explained what had happened to Maya. ...

I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... well...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
... W-wait. Wait wait wait.
</line><line>Maya:
What what what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm kidding! It was a joke!
</line><line>Maya:
No way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. <textEffects>(And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Just a piece...?)</textEffects> Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.
</line><line>Maya:
O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story. In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself. Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness. This is it! It's me or him!
