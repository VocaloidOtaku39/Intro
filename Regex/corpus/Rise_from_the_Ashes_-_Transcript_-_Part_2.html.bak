</line><line>Phoenix:
How did you know!?
</line><line>Angel:
I respect the prosecutors' basic abhorrence of crime. Yet their methods are ugly and twisted. Twisted methods will always lead to tragedy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The lunchlady's uninformed opinion is duly noted.
</line><line>Angel:
Given that they are used to erasing inconvenient evidence at their whim... Killing off a detective that knew too much is merely an extension of that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Ema:
Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
</line><line>Angel:
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if I hadn't been laid off by those prosecutors over there, I'd still be one.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Laid off...? <textEffects>(She was fired...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Angel:
To me, prosecutors are nothing more than worms. That said, I am a pro, as you know. My testimony is unbiased... and flawless.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. You may continue, Ms. Starr.

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following: Prosecutors are nothing more than worms. Ergo! You are a biased witness!
</line><line>Angel:
You might want to keep those silly opinions to YOURSELF in the future, rookie.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Rookie?
</line><line>Angel:
Unless you're willing to risk the consequences of doubting me? I'll fry you like a fritter! Crispy on the outside... chewy on the inside!!!
</line><line>Judge:
That... That was inspiring!
</line><line>Ema:
I believe I've heard that tag line elsewhere... you could cry plagiarism?
</line><line>Angel:
I may be relegated to the lowly post of lunchlady... But my instincts are honed!
</line><line>Judge:
A-a photograph! You took this!?
</line><line>Angel:
The moment I witnessed the crime, my reflexes took over and snap! I took a picture. In fact... One of my lunchboxes is rigged with a camera.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I suppose that's more exciting than just hanging it around your neck.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Er... this is my first time seeing this photograph.
</line><line>Angel:
You think I'd show it to you, a prosecutor? Think again.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Angel:
My boyfriend works in the photography division of Criminal Affairs.
</line><line>Judge:
Well... This is most certainly the defendant!

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh, that is unmistakably <span style="color:#E16935">Lana Skye</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, what was the defendant doing at the time?

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the "<textEffects>moment</textEffects>" she witnessed the crime!
</line><line>Angel:
Well, it seems I was slightly unclear. My apologies.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Angel:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-that's it!?
</line><line>Angel:
If you run out of lunch, you order seconds. Problem solved! If you don't like it, try ordering the jumbo sized lunch from the get-go!
</line><line>Ema:
Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice.
</line><line>Angel:
I didn't have time to stop her. Prosecutor Skye was cold, calculating, like a robot. She killed without pain or remorse! It was a <textEffects>premeditated murder</textEffects>!

</line><line>Phoenix:
P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Look at the chief prosecutor's hands in that photograph.
</line><line>Judge:
Well...! Are those... <textEffects>gloves</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Surgical gloves made of thin rubber, most likely. Why would she have those on?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If it was not premeditated, she would not be wearing those gloves!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Waaaaaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
These gloves do seem to tell a tale of premeditation!
</line><line>Angel:
Premeditated murder... a serious offense.
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! Add this to your testimony!
</line><line><i>Change statements:</i>
"The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand...." and "Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!" to "The murder was planned! The rubber gloves prove it!"

<line>Ema:
I-it's only a flesh wound, Mr. Wright! We can make it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You said that before. Anything else?
</line><line>Ema:
Scientifically speaking... Ms. Starr's testimony... is flawless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sounds pretty fatal to me.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Wh-what do we do!? Is this it? Is my sister guilty!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's just keep our heads cool and press the witness a bit, shall we? <textEffects>(For some reason, having her panicking next to me makes me calmer...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
D-don't smile like that!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Witness, do you know what this is?
</line><line>Angel:
Are you trying to test me? I sell box lunches for a living, you know. That's a knife. THE knife. The knife that was in Mr. Edgeworth's trunk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, it is my knife.
</line><line>What's with this case!?
The bloody murder weapon a red car... all belonging to the prosecutor there!?
The defendant is the chief prosecutor for the district, right?
Mommy, are prosecutors bad people?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
</line><line>Angel:
What's that, Rookie?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
</line><line>Judge:
Seems like a natural conclusion to me! The gloves do indicate planning...
</line><line>Phoenix:
However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... <textEffects>the murder weapon</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Angel:
Oh.
</line><line>Phoenix:
This knife just happened to be in the trunk of that car. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!
</line><line>Angel:
Ugh... Woooooooorrrgh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Great! Now the tide is turning in our favor!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Great show, Mr. Wright! My sister's as good as free!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright. I believe the next lunch you'll be eating is... humble pie!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I hope you weren't deluding yourself into thinking that the "tide has turned." Not over such a trifling detail!
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but this shoots a hole in the whole premeditated theory!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Bah! The prosecution could care less if it was premeditated or not. The only one who seems to care is that lunchlady over there.
</line><line>Angel:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defendant, Lana Skye, murdered a detective with a knife. That is the only thing the prosecution need prove. Nothing else.
</line><line>Angel:
Very good, Mr. Prosecutor... I suppose you think you're clever now? But you know as well as I do that she planned on killing him! It was planned! If it wasn't, why would she have been wearing...
</line><line>Judge:
I believe I'd like to hear your testimony again.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness, please tell us only what you "<textEffects>saw</textEffects>," not what you "thought."
</line><line>Angel:
How dare you! My powers of deduction are not to be underestimated!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Really now...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Angel's Deduction --</textEffects></center>
<line>Angel:
Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The victim was summoned from the Police Department to the Prosecutor's Office.. It does sound a lot like premeditation, doesn't it!?
</line><line>Ema:
So, if I order pizza, does that mean I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?
</line><line>Judge:
In any case, the defense may now cross-examine the witness.

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ms. Starr has turned out to be as short-tempered as she looked when we met her. Challenging her abilities as a detective really set her off!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
The short wick burns out the fastest! It's a scientific fact!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wonder... wouldn't it depend on the size of the candle? I mean, add more wax and even a really short wick will burn longer...
</line><line>Ema:
...&#160;Obviously, more scientific testing is required!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation...

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The witness is clearly not suited for detective work.
</line><line>Angel:
W-what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The suspect was not wearing a scarf or muffler of any kind when she stabbed the victim. And you've proved it yourself! With this photograph!
</line><line>Angel:
Huh? B-but that... That can't be!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Only a true professional could be so clueless. I'm sure you'll make a good lunchlady, have no fear.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm! Harsh words! But good!
</line><line>Ema:
In the end, Mr. Edgeworth prevails!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What was my objection, chopped liver!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Angel:
B-but it was there, a scarf, no, not that, but something red! Really!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well now, where were we? The witness has given us an entertaining interlude, now back to business.
</line><line>Angel:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, witness, continue your testimony. You saw the crime, and apprehended the suspect... Tell us about that.
</line><line>Angel:
...... Very well. I do remember some things accurately, at least.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ultimately, we couldn't shake the most important part of her testimony.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
The most important part...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The part where your sister stabs the victim! <textEffects>(This next testimony might just be the moment of truth!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Apprehending the Suspect --</textEffects></center>
<line>Angel:
After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side.
I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot.
Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!
That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
The chief prosecutor made to escape, but against Angel Starr, resistance is futile!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You are quite determined about this scarf, aren't you?
</line><line>Angel:
I strike like a snake and bite like a cobra! That's me. Angel Starr.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That wasn't a very good metaphor. First of all, a cobra is a kind of snake.
</line><line>Angel:
Don't bother me with details, unless you want to get bitten!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no thanks!
</line><line>Ema:
Note to self: Attorney Wright gets bitten by snake.
</line><line>Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum...
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-oil drum? <textEffects>(Hard to imagine...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Angel:
Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you will.

<line>Phoenix:
I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe. The Lunchland car was...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She was a "<textEffects>visitor</textEffects>," thus, she was parked in <textEffects>B Block</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, you witnessed the murder from... here?
</line><line>Judge:
That would make it about 30 feet from the car, yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Is that correct, Ms. Starr?
</line><line>Angel:
Y-yes, that's right.
</line><line>Judge:
But, there was a chain link fence in front of you...?
</line><line>Angel:
I went over it, of course.
</line><line>Judge:
Amazing! The Cough-up Queen, lunchlady athlete, indeed.
</line><line>Ema:
It would have taken her a little time to climb over the fence. So she couldn't have gotten to my sister THAT fast...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, that fence was about nine feet high, too. How come Ms. Skye didn't get away?)</textEffects>

<line>Angel:
<textEffects>Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?
</line><line>Angel:
Yes, ultimately.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ultimately?
</line><line>Angel:
My memory... it's like a salmon, heading upstream, you see.
</line><line>Judge:
N-no, the court doesn't see, Ms. Starr.
</line><line>Angel:
The chief prosecutor first attempted to use the phone hanging on the wall.
</line><line>Judge:
On the wall?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's right! Near the car... there was an emergency phone on the wall!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Angel:
Apparently, it was out of order.
</line><line>Judge:
And so she used her cell phone?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, the emergency phone was out of order that day.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Good witnessing, witness!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Good witnessing? What ever happened to good testifying?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You should of course add this to your testimony.

Not as sorry as I am.

But she didn't do it! You have to believe me!

<line>Phoenix:
I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The witness is a former detective. Her testimony is unmarred by personal bias.
</line><line>Angel:
Well, who would have thought you would be my knight in shining armor, prosecutor? You who, together with the chief prosecutor, kicked me out two years ago!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Starr... This is a fatal contradiction with your testimony... How do you explain this?
</line><line>Angel:
Hmph! I don't know what you're talking about. Mess with me... and I'll make you cough it ALL up!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ahem. Let's look at the floor plans. You said you witnessed the crime from this point. However, if that's true... You couldn't possibly have seen Ms. Skye making that phone call!
</line><line>Angel:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe you see what I'm getting at. That emergency phone was on the back side of this partition. If, indeed, you were in B Block... You couldn't have seen it!
</line><line>Angel:
Wha... Waaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! What is the meaning of this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's simple, Your Honor. She's not coughing up lunch...&#160; she's coughing up lies!!!
</line><line>Angel:
Grrr!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's quite a claim, Mr. Wright... perhaps you will allow me a question? Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Here's where the counterattack begins! I can't afford to get this wrong!)</textEffects> The witness lied about...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order. What is significant about this fact? Nothing. It would be pointless for her to lie about it!
</line><line>Judge:
Pointless to lie... I see!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witness did actually see Ms. Skye using the emergency phone. In other words... Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from a <textEffects>different location</textEffects>!

A different location!? Now that's a pointless lie if I ever heard one!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Before you call my lie pointless... at least let me tell it!
</line><line>Judge:
Let me ask a question to our clever wordsmith, Mr. Wright. Just where was the witness when she saw the crime!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...)</textEffects> <textEffects>The place from where Ms. Starr witnessed this crime was... here!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
This is the only place where she could have been.
</line><line>Judge:
The security guard room?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, the security room in the underground parking lot is well positioned... It's built on the second level, so you can see the entire lot.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... She would have been able to see the emergency phone from there. But why there? There are many other places where she could have seen the phone.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not in this case, Your Honor. The witness, not being part of the Prosecutor's Office, couldn't park in A Block. The only place where she could have seen the crime and the back of the partition is here. I remember in your testimony, you said... You brought a lunch to your&#160;"boyfriend" in the security guard room, yes? Well, Ms. Starr?
</line><line>Angel:
... How many years have I been getting the better of men...? To think that the tables could be turned... Today, a man has got the better of Angel Starr!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Witness! What have you done!? You used to be a detective! You should know better!
</line><line>Angel:
I'm not turning back. The guilty will be punished. And I'll do what I must to make sure justice prevails.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The guilty... is she talking about Ms. Skye...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright? Doesn't this strike you as odd? Why did Ms. Starr lie? It doesn't make sense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Ema:
She could have just said she saw the crime from the security guard station. It wouldn't change anything!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly! This photograph tells all! It was the defendant who stabbed the victim! That truth still stands!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
It "still stands"? I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If a witness is found to be lying, they're guilty of perjury. She knows this. She wouldn't risk that without a good reason!
</line><line>Judge:
So, tell us what her reason was, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Huh? M-me?
</line><line>Judge:
Who else!?
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from <span style="color:#E16935">the security guard station</textEffects>... But she lied and said she saw it from <textEffects>B Block</textEffects>... It must make a <textEffects>vital difference</textEffects>... but what? What would change...?)</span>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
My condolences, Mr. Wright... But one look at the floor plans and it's quite clear. The distance between the scene of the crime and the guard station is 30 feet. I don't see how that would change what she could see.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
What she saw is not in question here. What matters is the time it would take her to reach the scene of the crime!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! You witnessed the crime from the security guard station! Now, how long did it take you to go from there... to the scene of the crime, where you arrested Ms. Skye!?
</line><line>Angel:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Well, witness?
</line><line>Angel:
You...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes...?
</line><line>Angel:
You ordered the Squid Wheels, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The quality of my lunches has gone from low to inedible.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Angel:
I was bringing a PB&amp;J lunch with fresh boysenberry jam to my boyfriend.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Boysenberry for the boyfriend!
</line><line>Angel:
He wasn't in the station, so I waited. I witnessed the crime from the glass-walled station... and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself running towards the scene. But... the door was locked. I couldn't open it. That's why I had to go through the visitor's parking in <textEffects>B Block</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
That's quite a detour.
</line><line>Angel:
It probably took me at least <textEffects>five minutes</textEffects> to get to the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
F-f-f-five minutes!? Hmm... This changes things considerably!
</line><line>Angel:
But, it was that woman over there in the defendant's chair who stabbed him! I know it! I have photographic evidence! I swear it... I swear it on my finest plastic spork!
</line><line>Judge:
You have a point. And the spork is a wonderful invention.
</line><line>Angel:
Would you like another Caviar Lunch...?
</line><line>Judge:
Absolutely!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have any evidence to stop this...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest! Think about it! You could make pasta in that amount of time! If you like it al dente!
</line><line>Angel:
I've got lunchboxes that tie pasta into knots, Rookie!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A five minute "blank"... Isn't that strange!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Strange...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you were a criminal... What would you do with five minutes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, um... I guess I'd flee the scene. Hey! D-don't get the wrong idea! I didn't kill anyone...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you have the instincts of a killer! You would run! But this time was different! Ms. Skye dawdled at the scene of the crime... she even had her picture taken! No true criminal would act this way! It's inconceivable!
</line><line>Angel:
Y- yeeeaaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
Well then. It seems we've come to the end of this testimony. She has a grudge against the defendant, and there is a blank in her testimony.
</line><line>Angel:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, is the next witness ready to go?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... I appear to have overestimated this witness on account of her professional history...
</line><line>Ema:
We did it! We screwed that can shut, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-that was too close!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid that the Cough-up Queen has been dethroned. And with that, court is adjourned!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I prefer to not take the defense team's leftovers. Anything else to say?
</line><line>Angel:
I... might be able to save you. I have decisive evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what was that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is this another one of her trick lunchboxes!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
My apologies, but we have no further questions to ask of you, Ms. Starr.
</line><line>Angel:
Ah... Is this your jumbo lunchbox?
</line><line>Judge:
Whoo hoo! A triple-decker! Out of deference to the witness's determination, I'll allow one more testimony! Let's hear about this <textEffects>decisive evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Angel:
Like the Lunchland motto says, you won't be disappointed!

I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?
Two types of blood were found on this shoe!
One was of course the victim's.
And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!
This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness, what's the meaning of this? Why is this the first time I've heard of this evidence?
</line><line>Angel:
Simple. As I've already said... I don't trust you with evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! That's why I took the liberty of investigating this myself.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And... you had blood tests performed?
</line><line>Angel:
Didn't I mention? I have three boyfriends in forensics.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In any case, Your Honor, I can't accept this as evidence!
</line><line>Angel:
What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You should know the two rules of <textEffects>evidence law</textEffects>, Ms. Starr! Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without <textEffects>the approval of the Police Department</textEffects>! In other words, this shoe is illegal evidence! At least, for the time being!
</line><line>Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth sure is celebrating.
</line><line>Angel:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Angel:
Don't forget... I used to be a detective! As I mentioned previously... This shoe has already been tested by a member of the forensics department! As you can see, it was approved by the Police Department as of... today. Even the general public can produce official evidence, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nuh... Ungh!
</line><line>Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth is looking pretty sullen.
</line><line>Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution's complaints notwithstanding... It appears that this evidence satisfies the first rule of evidence law. Well... It seems you have yet another count against you, witness.
</line><line>Angel:
Anything to ensure that the guilty are properly judged.

That gleam in your eyes... You're still young, Rookie. I'd give you a peppered fish gut now, but you couldn't take the heat, could you!
</line><line>Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say! What is contradictory about the victim's shoe? Show us the problem with this evidence!

<line>Phoenix:
I wonder if you noticed... there's <textEffects>blood</textEffects> on the bottom of this shoe!
</line><line>Angel:
Don't mess with me, Rookie... Or it'll be your blood on the bottom of my shoe!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, there is quite a bit of blood on the bottom of the shoe.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It makes sense. The victim was stabbed with a knife! What could possibly be contradictory about blood on the bottom of his shoe!?

The problem lies... in <textEffects>the footprint</textEffects>.

The... footprint?

Note that the bottom of the victim's shoe is covered in blood. Then... isn't it strange? Why weren't any bloody footprints found by the scene of the crime!?

Ah hah!

As you can see... There were no traces of any such footprints at the scene of the crime! That contradicts your claim about this shoe!

If there were bloody prints they would have been found. We checked the scene and found nothing of the sort!

</line><line>Angel:

Great going, Mr. Wright! But... It's true that the lack of a footprint is a contradiction... But then we have to ask why there wasn't a footprint!

That's true! There has to be a reason why there wasn't a footprint!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... Now I get it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Get what!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Our witness is more devious than I gave her credit for! We were hoodwinked to the very end! But she slipped! There is one vital hint to the truth in her testimony...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Think back to when she told us about apprehending the suspect...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum... Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I thought that was a strange thing for the normally cool-headed chief to do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No kidding!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, witness. Allow me to ask a very simple question. This "oil drum"... was it empty?
</line><line>Angel:
... Oh, that, hmm? I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Edgeworth. Though apparently you're not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory.
</line><line>Judge:
Witness! W-well? Was the oil drum empty...?
</line><line>Angel:
The oil drum kicked over by the chief prosecutor... was brimming with water.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-water? <textEffects>(What does that mean?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Still don't get it, Mr. Wright? Do you want to know the reason she knocked it over? The REAL reason?
</line><line>Judge:
Aaaa haaaaah! You don't mean...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, the suspect knocked over that oil drum for one reason and one reason alone! To erase the blood stains that would become evidence against her!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaargh!
</line><line>Judge:
That ties things up quite nicely! The blood stains left on the victim's shoes tie her quite clearly to this murder! Then, after the deed was done, she knocked over the oil drum to erase the telltale signs!
</line><line>Angel:
Why, that's a prosecutor's specialty... erasing evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
</line><line>Judge:
Well... I see no reason to prolong this trial.
</line><line>Ema:
M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!
</line><line>Ema:
B-but...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Enough. There is no need for further debate. The verdict, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well...

M-Mr. Wright, wait! Look at the asphalt in this photo!

Hey! It's clearly wet!

Erasing the last trace of doubt from the court's mind. Immediately after the murder, the crime scene was washed with water!

Very well! This time I'd like to declare a verdict for good!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, wait!
</line><line>Judge:
What is it with you people!? Can't I hand down my verdicts in peace anymore!? Whatever it is, can it wait?
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no it can't. Then it will be too late! Look at this photograph, the last one submitted... This trial isn't over... until we give each piece of evidence proper consideration!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, Wright... Are you saying there's a problem with this latest piece of evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah! <textEffects>(I'll think later!)</textEffects> Yeah, there's a problem! <textEffects>(Right or wrong, I've got to go ahead with this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake. Very well, Mr. Wright. <textEffects>Show the court the problem in this photograph!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The problem in this photograph... is here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What's this...? There's something poking out of <textEffects>the car's muffler</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Wait just a moment, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
You just said "<textEffects>muffler</textEffects>"... However I see no trace of a muffler or scarf of any kind in this photograph!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... A muffler is also a part on a car or motorcycle, Your Honor. Just think of it as... part of the exhaust system. A pipe...
</line><line>Judge:
I see! And... I see! What's that suspicious-looking cloth sticking out of the car's muffler?
</line><line>Angel:
Hmph! So what if there is something sticking out of the muffler! What does that have to do with this case? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!
</line><line>Angel:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind! Tell us why you think this piece of cloth in the muffler is related to this case.
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Angel:
Ah yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned <textEffects>the muffler</textEffects>! That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Angel:
<textEffects>Muffler</textEffects>! argh! Yeearrrrgh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Could it be that the "muffler" you heard mentioned... Was actually <textEffects>this exhaust pipe</textEffects>!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!
</line><line>Angel:
Oh... Whooooooooooo ooooooooooooragh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well... It seems we will have to suspend the proceedings.
</line><line>Angel:
Sus... Suspend!?
</line><line>Judge:
I find myself wondering about that piece of cloth. If we leave any question unanswered here we do a disservice to the law! Have the car at the crime scene inspected at once, and bring me that cloth! The verdict will wait until after we've seen all the evidence. Agreed...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I suppose so.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Whew... that was close. But... we made it... at least for now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The court will adjourn for a thirty minute recess! It's lunchtime after all!

<line>Ema:
Um... Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What?
</line><line>Ema:
Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?
</line><line>Ema:
Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
</line><line>Ema:
So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.
</line><line>???:
Hola, Pardner!
</line><line>Marshall:
They say you show a red cloth to a bull, it'll fire up its temper! That's what they told me when I was a young'un, at least.
</line><line>Ema:
Officer Marshall!
</line><line>Marshall:
Thought I'd come take a look-see at how the trial's going. Looks like I'm late. They've got the place locked down tighter than a fort in enemy territory!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is going on over there, anyway? All the police I've seen these last two days have been really on edge.
</line><line>Marshall:
Don't you got enough on your plate without worrying about other people, compadre? You could be worrying about the chief prosecutor's taste in mufflers, for example.
</line><line>Ema:
Um... Officer Marshall? The whole "muffler" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!
</line><line>Marshall:
You don't say? Now don't that just beat all.
</line><line>Ema:
...?
</line><line>Marshall:
I've seen the red breeze blow at her slender neck many a time... I saw it that day, too. She was wearing a <textEffects>red muffler</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ema:
What!?
</line><line>Marshall:
At the awards ceremony that afternoon. Edgeworth's seen it too, I'd reckon.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What does that mean!? In the photograph taken at the crime scene... she wasn't wearing a scarf!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
So, Ms. Starr wasn't mistaken...
</line><line>Marshall:
Well, it's about time. Remember, pardner, sometimes you gotta grab the bull by the horns... and sometimes you just gotta let that bull go where it will. Time will tell!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
So... what are we swimming in now, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Marshall:
If it's steak sauce, I can hook you up with some fine ribs! Ooh-wee!

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's up? The judge keeps looking over at the prosecution...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Your face is blue, your lips are purple, you're sweating bullets... That furrowed brow, those grinding teeth, those watery eyes... What's more your eyes are unfocused, you're doubled over, your back is bent...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It... can't... be!! This... can't... happen!
</line><line>Ema:
I wonder what happened to Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, I believe it is time we continued on with this trial. During our recess I had requested that the prosecution conduct an investigation...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-this is unacceptable!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It seems our prosecutor is quite beside himself.
</line><line>???:
Ah, er, excuse me. Knock knock?
</line><line>Judge:
...? Who's there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's with this guy? A strange, stuffy aura seems to be filling the courtroom.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Hey! The temperature rose 5.7 degrees when that man came in!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who on earth is he...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, it's you...
</line><line>???:
Oh! Oh, heh heh. Sorry I'm late, Udgey! The roads were packed. It's just me! Long time no see, eh, Udgey? How ya been? Swim much these days!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah! Hello, hello. No, I've been so busy...
</line><line>???:
Busy! Busy-smizzy, Udgey, my boy! You have to make time to relax!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-yes, indeed.
</line><line>Ema:
Udgey... seems to be his nickname for the judge...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid you're right. Very afraid. Um... sorry, but... who are you?
</line><line>???:
Ah hah! So you're Wrighto! The attorney! I've heard good things about you, son!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Eh? Uh, th-thanks...?
</line><line>???:
So sorry about our little Worthy giving you all that trouble, eh? You know, we should all go swimming together sometime! Jolly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Little... Little Worthy...?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! You don't know the district Chief of Police!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Chuh....? Chief of Police...!?
</line><line>Judge:
He's the top ranking police officer in the entire district!
</line><line>Gant:
Name's Gant, Damon Gant. Pleased to meet you, everyone!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So, uh, to what do we owe this honor today? It's been over... two years since you last came to this courtroom, hasn't it?
</line><line>Gant:
Well, it's Worthy, here. Look at the poor fellow! I just thought I'd help out... by bringing this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! Th-that's...!
</line><line>Ema:
My sister's muffler!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So Ms. Starr wasn't just seeing things! When the crime occurred, Ms. Skye really was wearing that muffler!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gant:
But to think that it was stuffed into that exhaust pipe... On little Worthy's car, no less! It's really quite embarrassing, even for us.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what's this!?
</line><line>Gant:
It's what you'd call a switchblade knife. Quite perplexing, this.

M-Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How could they miss such a vital piece of evidence!? If your investigators are this lax, how do you expect us to do our job?
</line><line>Gant:
N-now wait a minute, Worthy!

I've no desire to hear your excuses!
</line><line>Gant:
I'm telling you to wait! Or didn't you hear me?

...!
</line><line>Gant:
Have a look at this document, where it says "person in charge of investigation"... There's no mistaking that signature... <textEffects>Miles Edgeworth</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-that's no fair! The day of the crime, I-I had...
</line><line>Gant:
Your head in the clouds because you got that award! I know how you feel... But you're the person in charge. I'll expect a written apology.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What? Are you serious!?
</line><line>Gant:
Don't be too upset, we'll find a way to clean up this mess... that you made.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Ema:
This is the first time I've seen Mr. Edgeworth at a loss for words...
</line><line>Judge:
This kind of major blunder is unlike you Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gah...!
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts this new evidence. But, I'd like to ask the defense a favor first.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Just to be sure... I'd like to take a look at the blade of this knife.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The b-blade, Your Honor? Well, I don't see why not...
</line><line>Judge:
Could you open it up for me, I wonder?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, well. I think all you have to do is push that switch, and...
</line><line>Judge:
If I cut my finger Mr. Wright, I wouldn't be able to pound my gavel anymore.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah. But if I cut my finger, I wouldn't be able to point it at people anymore...)</textEffects>

Anyway, we at the Department were all a-flustered, as you might well assume. We're in the middle of a top-top-secret investigation. Don't tell anyone, okay?

The chances of that are really slim. Scientifically speaking, of course.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-but your officer, he told me! He said that report had nothing to do with the Lana Skye incident!
</line><line>Gant:
[<textEffects>Detective Bruce Goodman</textEffects> murdered in the Police Department evidence room...] Mr. Edgeworth. The victim's name is written right on the top of the report.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gaaaaaaah! Wh-why didn't your officer tell me!?
</line><line>Ema:
Honestly, I'm not sure if that officer was capable of making the connection... He did seem... challenged.
</line><line>Gant:
In any case, this is a serious error, a gross negligence of duty on your part, Worthy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-But, sir!!! You could have submitted that report this morning to the court, as evidence! Then, I...
</line><line>Gant:
No such luck this time, Worthy... or should I say, un-Worthy?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Gant:
Now what was the second rule of evidence law, hmm?
</line><line>Ema:
Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, well, it's, uh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Rule 2: New evidence may only be submitted if it concerns the case on trial. And how is this relevant!?
</line><line>Gant:
Normally, you submit a list of evidence to be used in court before the trial. This report wasn't on that list...
</line><line>Judge:
So... What does this mean?
</line><line>Gant:
I couldn't submit this evidence until a connection was proven in court.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!!
</line><line>Gant:
That connection was just proven by Wrighto over here. Good job, Wrighto, my boy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Uh... I... I was just doing my job.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... Noooooooooooooo!!!

<line>Judge:
It seems... we have come to the end of this trial.
</line><line>Gant:
You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! I apologize for this terrible lack of due diligence on my part...
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please... Just give me one day. I'll get to the bottom of what happened... If it's the last thing I do!
</line><line>Gant:
You'd better get results this time. Really.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
</line><line>Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Judge:
I don't think there's ever been an error this serious in the history of this court. We will grant one further day as the prosecution has requested. Will this be sufficient, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.
</line><line>Judge:
Whatever your punishment for this is, for your sake I hope it's not... decisive. Very well! Court is adjourned!
