</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper?
</line><line>Ema:
Yes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy?
</line><line>Ema:
I tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe you're just freakishly strong...?
</line><line>Ema:
Excuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator!
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-Sorry... <textEffects>(...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, sir... It won't happen again, sir...
</line><line>Ema:
Hmph! ...Moving on!

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The victim was struck twice, by the way.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
Phoenix:
Well... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim.
</line><line>Maya:
This is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
</line><line>Maya:
Okay, Nick! Now, go get him!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No need to rush me, Maya... <textEffects>(All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.
</line><line>Ema:
For what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
For embarrassing you in front of your idol.
</line><line>Ema:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown.
</line><line>Ema:
Aaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's.
</line><line>Ema:
Ah...! Oooh...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony.
</line><line>Ema:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ema is unusually fired up today...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Don't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too.
</line><line>Ema:
Listen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective.
</line><line>Ema:
You can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, really? And what makes you so sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>One look at this here, and it should become obvious.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke.
</line><line>Ema:
.......You're right!
</line><line>Maya:
But wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since <textEffects>before the reception started</textEffects>. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception!
</line><line>Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
In short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body <textEffects>after the reception</textEffects>... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims!
</line><line>Ema:
AAAAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Urngh... Th-That's...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Even you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do explain, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. In other words... <textEffects>If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
If the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh! You're right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course I do. <textEffects>(I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. In that case... <textEffects>What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
The photo of the victim again...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. <textEffects>I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
Flower petals, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
These petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And just where do you propose this "somewhere else" to be, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented "compelling evidence."
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm?
</line><line>Judge:
I gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment on this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-But, Your Honor...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case!
</line><line>Maya:
Then you mean, the body was...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love!
</line><line>Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you talking about now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Take another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(I wish he would just tell me already...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct?
</line><line>Ema:
Heh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. Let's see what you can do.
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Skye, please give your testimony to this court.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --</textEffects></center>
<line>Ema:
The victim could not have been killed before the reception.
The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.
And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
It's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm......... I guess so.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics?
</line><line>Phoenix:
......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Ema:
Wh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
............... 
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects>
<textEffects>-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --</textEffects></center>
<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The victim could not have been killed before the reception.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really?
</line><line>Maya:
I take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, there's gotta be a way somehow...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.
</line><line>Ema:
Finally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Is still entirely plausible!
</line><line>Ema:
Huh? Wh-What makes you think that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this.
</line><line>Judge:
And what is that contraption, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall.
</line><line>Judge:
And this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic.
</line><line>Judge:
Dry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold?
</line><line>Ema:
......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception...
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now we're getting somewhere!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? For what?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What piece of evidence?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
To get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Judge:
So the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. It was none other than the defendant.
</line><line><textEffects>Hold Entry Record added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arngh... 
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean by "discreetly"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ellen:
For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I see...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Gaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Look at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! <textEffects>(Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies.
</line><line>Ema:
Way to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away.
</line><line>Maya:
I guess he had a lot of stress built up.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll give him something to stress over before we're through today!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs.
</line><line>Judge:
... Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... <textEffects>(Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I will! I will!
</line><line>Phoenix:
........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it!
</line><line>Judge:
Interesting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Well, now what...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Wait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You can?
</line><line>Maya:
Remember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Th-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
....."When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Gaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery!
</line><line>Larry:
Yikes!
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it!
</line><line>Larry:
Noooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Let us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time.

District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3</textEffects></center>
<line>Maya:
Wow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whew! I'm exhausted already.
</line><line>???:
Boss!
</line><line>Athena:
I'm here for moral support!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show?
</line><line>Athena:
Well... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged.
</line><line>Athena:
That may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed!
</line><line>???:
Hah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician!
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?
</line><line>Trucy:
Magical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene!
</line><line>Athena:
N-Nooooooooooooooooooo!

N-Nick... How could you...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...)</textEffects> Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify.

<line>Phoenix:
I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall.
</line><line>Larry:
Huh?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display.
</line><line>Larry:
Nnnnngh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?!
</line><line>Larry:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

N-No... Larry, y-you didn't...!

</line><line>Larry:
W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?!
</line><line>Maya:
Maybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him?
</line><line>Larry:
M-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-You "snuck into the reception"...?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...)</textEffects>

Mr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury.
</line><line>Maya:
After all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her...
</line><line>Larry:
Just 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that.
</line><line>Larry:
N-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>-- Moving the Lantern --</textEffects></center>
<line>Larry:
It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern.
I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken.
There was a note on it that said, "Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen."
So I decided to do Elly a favor.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception.
</line><line><textEffects>Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme.
</line><line>Larry:
Scheme? What scheme?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This note from the defendant: "Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.
</line><line>Larry:
*gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands.

No way, Edgey! I don't believe it!

Hmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination.

Wow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends...

Assuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned.

Oh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess that just about sums it up.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Is that...?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all.
</line><line>Larry:
WHAT?! Why not?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You swapped the lanterns <textEffects>before the reception began</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah. That's what I said, isn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...<textEffects>after you got locked up in a cabin</textEffects> for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both <textEffects>before the reception</textEffects>... ...and <textEffects>after the reception took place</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception?
</line><line>Larry:
Umm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Butz?
</line><line>Larry:
.....I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Larry:
I tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The "first" reception? <textEffects>(Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
Then, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Larry:
We went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Um, well...
</line><line>Larry:
None of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
Go on, Nick. I know you can do it!
</line><line>Maya:
Looks like you don't have much choice, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!)</textEffects> ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. "Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to <textEffects>just before the reception began</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......It what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel!

</line><line>Judge:
A-A time machine?!

Yes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not done, you birdbrain!
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-Birdbrain?!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That's a good point...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Honestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth--
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nnnnngh...
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put "common sense" to the test?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
......Well, uh... ..................

<line>???:
Ha ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense.
</line><line>Nichody:
I can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
How so, Mr. Nichody?
</line><line>Nichody:
You have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-Then, that means...
</line><line>Nichody:
It was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?!
</line><line>Nichody:
To make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nnngh!
</line><line>Nichody:
Master Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Are you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why?
</line><line>Nichody:
Indeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then who hid the body in the lantern?
</line><line>Nichody:
We did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?!
</line><line>Nichody:
There is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct!
</line><line>Nichody:
I admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable.
</line><line>Judge:
This is quite a turn of events!
</line><line>???:
......... ......Heh heh heh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, now...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's not get hasty, Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I bet you can't do it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Just before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
You still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This "third person" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
But, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?!
</line><line>Judge:
Now, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Phew! That was close...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one.
</line><line>Nichody:
Understood, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!
