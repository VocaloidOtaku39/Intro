Soseki:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
This is it then, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's time to put an end to this now. To the miserable 'curse' that has been plaguing Mr Natsume... To everything!
</line><line>Susato:
And in my own small way, I shall do everything I can to help you!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I always appreciate your help, Miss Susato.
</line><line>Soseki:
</line>
<center>Suffering Soseki Selfishly Sidelined!</center>
<line>
Susato:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Good...morning to you too, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:
'GOOD MORNING'...? 'GOOD MORNING', LOCUM STUDENT MR NARUHODO ESQUIRE?! LISTEN TO YOU TWO CHATTING AWAY HAPPILY AS IF THE MAIN PLAYER OF TODAY'S TRIAL ISN'T HERE! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? WHY?!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear... We didn't mean to cause offence, Mr Natsume. I thought perhaps that because you had your eyes shut so tightly, you were meditating. Finding inner calm. It seemed wrong to disturb you.
</line><line>Soseki:
I was waiting! 'What's the matter, Mr Natsume? You seem...different somehow today...' 'Why naturally. That's because I've attained spiritual enlightenment. The path of literature, you see, is a journey to discover one's own death!' ...Or suchlike. That's the sort of morning conversation I was hoping for! That's why I had my eyes shut!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I...missed the signs, I'm afraid. Somehow. You'll have to forgive me.
</line><line>Susato:
And you mustn't talk of your path leading you to death, Mr Natsume!
</line><line>Soseki:
THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Oh yes, there it is. Inner calm...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
You, you barely came to see me at all yesterday. I, I was sure you'd abandoned me and returned to our beautiful, long-lost homeland!
</line><line>Susato:
We've not even been in Great Britain a week yet.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, well, anyway... ...I intend to set everything straight in court today. I'm determined to uncover the truth.
</line><line>Soseki:
...! I've actually reached an important decision myself.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh? What sort of decision?
</line><line>Soseki:
I shall fill you in after the trial!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Alright.
</line><line>Susato:
It would seem... ...Mr Sholmes isn't coming today, after all. It's a very clever message, I think! 'My dear fellows, you must win this battle on your own merits!'
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's a very clear message, I think. That he's overslept again.
</line><line>Soseki:
The 'great detective'? My arch-nemesis... LONG MAY HE STAY AWAY! ...If you ask me.
</line><line>Bailiff:
Defendant! And your legal representative! The trial is about to begin. Make your way into the courtroom immediately!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Today, once again, we face the Reaper. And when the Reaper stands for the prosecution, the defendant's fate is sealed. But I don't believe in that legend any more than I believe in Soseki-san's curse. The truth is hidden here somewhere. And I won't let it escape me. I have to keep believing in my client, and keep fighting to the very end. That's all!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>23rd February, 9:40 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution is ready.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, the defence is ready!
</line><line>Judge:
Very good. And now I call upon the six ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...chosen by lot to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to proceed?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Absolutely! Justice will be done, you mark my words!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I feel obliged to say...I feel especially ruthless on days when my hat is sitting just right.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Oh...well I wonder if you could adjust my hat for me. And please, be as ruthless as you like...
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Thieves deserve to die if you ask me. Especially gas thieves! I've no sympathy for the man at all!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Look! I said it yesterday and I'll say it again now. I don't have time for this! I've got my own problems!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Oh, may the Lord show us all the light here, and lead His flock to a righteous verdict again today...
</line><line>Judge:
Now...Lord van Zieks, what can you tell us?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution's report, please, for the court. In relation to the theory expounded by the defence yesterday...regarding the defendant's tea.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(So he does have the results...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...Before the prosecution delivers the black news about the black tea belonging to the blackguard in the dock... ...pray, allow me a moment to savour a liquid of a more sanguine hue. In fact, I'll defer to the good detective for the report. ...Here's to you, Inspector.
</line><line>Gregson:
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir. As indicated by the defence, we found a bar of soap just outside the victim's window in the snow. And there was indeed a frozen <textEffects>reddish liquid</textEffects> in a little depression on the top of it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's the tea! That's what Mr Natsume brought with him that night!
</line><line>Gregson:
Well the brains at the Yard analysed it, and yes, you're right: it was tea. And there wasn't a trace of strychnine or any other toxic substance in it.
</line><line>Susato:
...! No poison at all!
</line><line>Gregson:
In other words...the tea that the defendant brought with him to the victim's room...is <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>. It's in the clear.
</line><line>Judge:
What a revelation!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(As I suspected...)</textEffects> This makes it quite clear! The defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume, is blameless here!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
My learned friend is jumping to conclusions again. ...A typical Nipponese reaction.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes, it's true, no poison was found in the few drops of liquid recovered from the soap on the window ledge. But! What logic is that? Would you take a drop from the Thames and conclude that the water in the ocean isn't salty?
</line><line>Judge:
My word! The water in the ocean is extremely salty, Counsel!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Exactly! Unfit for drinking! Just as the victim's tea was on the night in question, as the court has already heard. 'Bitter' was the precise word from the lips of Mr William Shamspeare... ...whom the prosecution now calls back to the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, I will uphold the prosecution's request.
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Shamspeare...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it sounds like we're going to have another confrontation with our theatrical friend.
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Show Mr Shamspeare to the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
Mr William Shamspeare...the victim of this despicable crime.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'O Heaven! O Hell! Do you command me to remember?' Forsooth, 'twas I, Shamspeare, did have a bellyful of the foul fluid giv'n! In mine innocence!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes...but as was revealed in yesterday's proceedings... ...the witness is not as innocent as we had perhaps first been led to believe.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
By using bars of soap such as this, he has been stealing gas from the supply company, yes.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'One may smile, and smile, and be a villain...' Forsooth, 'twas I, Shamspeare, did have a roomful of the sweet fuel giv'n!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
That's right! Fellow jurors, don't forget...this man is a rotten thief!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
I haven't forgotten! Kept all that about the ice coins a tidy secret, didn't you? You should've owned up sooner.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Arrest him, I say! Arrest him at once! And let him feel the sting in my tail!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
O, indeed! By dint of vile and cowardly means have I plotted to further mine own ends. I confess! Thou wouldst not pardon my sins, of that I am sure.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If you acknowledge your wrongdoing, what exactly are you doing here?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'Cowards die many times before their deaths.' And for a coward such as I...death be well deserv'd. But! Would it that a still greater crime passeth unpunish'd? For lo! The hairy-faced gentleman of farther East than Verona did contrive to poison me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But there was no poison in the tea found in your room! The police have attested to that.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What the defence would assert as an inconsistency will quickly be cleared up by the witness's testimony. Is that not so, Mr Shamspeare?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Verily, my liege! I would most gladly speak!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let the witness testify to explain this inconsistency. Tell the court why it is that poison apparently entered your body, though none was found in the tea!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Tea Inconsistency -</textEffects></center>
<line>Shamspeare:
The Japanese man did come to my chamber with tea brew'd in a pot.
'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison.
Whilst feigning distraction in our debate, ne'er did a drop of his own drink pass his lips.
When he departed by and by, I did use the tea that remain'd in his cup to make my coins of ice.
Thus 'tis no surprise that poison be not found in the tea I did pour into the moulds of soap.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
The poison was slipped into the cup after the tea had been poured. The normal way for poison to be administered...in my experience.
</line><line>Judge:
Quite. Otherwise it would be disastrous if the poisoner were to mix up the cups, for instance.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But no poison bottle was found at the scene!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Because, quite simply, the Nipponese took the bottle back to his own room.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The absence of a vessel containing the poison only becomes problematic when considering suicide.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(I knew that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
By now it should be perfectly clear. A bar or two of cheap soap... ...is wholly insufficient to was the deep stains of guilt from the accused's hands.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Sirs! Madams! 'Tis true that I, Shamspeare, be a common thief of gas... But... BUT! Listen here, ladies and gentlemen... Wherefore would I lie? Verily, I have no cause! I have nought to lose!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Well...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
I do declare...
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you for your testimony, witness. Counsel, proceed with the cross-examination!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross-Examination</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Tea Inconsistency -</textEffects></center>
<line>Shamspeare:
<textEffects>The Japanese man did come to my chamber with tea brew'd in a pot.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Shamspeare:
<textEffects>'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Shamspeare:
<textEffects>Whilst feigning distraction in our debate, ne'er did a drop of his own drink pass his lips.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Shamspeare:
<textEffects>When he departed by and by, I did use the tea that remain'd in his cup to make my coins of ice.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Shamspeare:
<textEffects>Thus 'tis no surprise that poison be not found in the tea I did pour into the moulds of soap.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Hm... So it's been proven that there was no poison in Soseki-san's tea. That should be hugely in our favour. But the atmosphere in this courtroom today...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
It feels as though everybody is against us, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It must be the Reaper's poison.
</line><line>Susato:
I'm afraid that if we don't find a significant flaw in this testimony somewhere... ...the jury will pounce and find Mr Natsume guilty!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It really feels like we've jumped into the fire here...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
You claim that Mr Natsume didn't drink a drop of tea on the night in question... ...but that's impossible.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
How, how, how, choplogic? What is this, ye dark yclad fiend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The two teacups from the scene - one used by the victim and the other by the defendant... ...have a clear difference between them...one that represents incontrovertible proof!
</line><line>Judge:
Incontrovertible?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What difference?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Look at the inside of the cups. Just here...there's a clearly visible ring.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes... A tea ring. Commonplace enough.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. Such stains occur all too readily when one leaves tea in the cup for a while.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And yet...Nr Natsume's cup has no such ring.
</line><line>Judge:
Good Lord! You're right! It's completely clean...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
And prithee, sir, what mak'st thou of it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly what Mr Natsume told the court yesterday. The Japanese saying he quoted!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Drink...
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
...Tea...
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...While it's hot!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right! Yes... ...the jittery Mr Natsume was true to his usual self that night, and drank his tea in no time.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Uh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If, as you claim in your testimony, he didn't touch a drop of his tea... ...a ring would have developed on the inside of his cup as well, after the several hours the tea was left standing.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
But...erm...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In short, Mr Shamspeare... ...you clearly lied to the court!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Get...thee...to a nunneriiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
As a rule, I fill my hallowed chalice up to seven times during any one trial.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(You might want to keep that information to yourself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yet on occasion, tedium distracts me and I pour more times than I intended until the bottle is dry.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your drinking habits are fascinating, but...irrelevant.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
On the contrary. They illustrate the fickleness of human memory. To William Shamspeare...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Y-Yes...my liege...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...though you previously stated that you made the coins of ice from the leftover tea in the accused's cup... ...could it be that you were perhaps <textEffects>mistaken</textEffects>?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Eh?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Could it be that...yes. Perhaps there was some tea remaining in the small teapot left at the scene. A fact that had vanished from your memory until now...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
......... Faith, my liege, thou art a magician! For verily...'tis as though thou hast seen with thine own eyes that night.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Forsooth! I was mistook! I did plan to use tea from the Japanese fellow's cup, but lo! When I looked, 'twas empty! And thus did I use the dregs that fester'd in the teapot, as my liege did suggest.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And you've just suddenly remembered now that you made a mistake before? Are we supposed to believe that?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
People's memories are imperfect, my learned friend. Which is why we rely on evidence instead.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
But in any case, it makes no difference. The victim's most recent testimony tells us two things of note: Firstly, that the poison was put into the victim's teacup only. And secondly, that this spoilt cup was not the source of the insipid 'ice coins' that have bewitched this court.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... The prosecution makes a fine summary of the facts.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Furthermore, that testimony remains valid and in full support of the established facts. In other words... ...the inconsistency claimed by the defence simply does not exist!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No!
</line><line>What does this mean then?
I do declare it means there's no issue with the gas thief's testimony...
Apart from the bit about thieving gas, obviously!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
My lords, ladies and gentlemen of the jury! I do solemnly swear... After I did dine at Grub's Grubbery alehouse that night... ...nought did pass my lips but the black tea giv'n me by the Japanese, whose back be stoop'd as low as death!
</line><line>Judge:
And on what did you dine, sir?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Why, I did partake of my favourites: a broth as wouldst be call'd soup and a leaf as wouldst be call'd salad...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As insalubrious a menu as the establishment where it was served...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'But you gods will give us, Some faults to make us men.' Willingly would I suffer what punishment 'tis seen fit to serve a wicked thief of gas. But! I pray ye wise and noble fellows, ne'er forget the simple truth...
</line>
<center>That be one thing, and this be another!</center>
<line>
Juror No. 2:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Jurors all, your humble servant Shamspeare doth entreat you: punish the Japanese fellow for his sins!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>My Loooooord!!!</center>
<line>
Juror No. 1:
If I may speak, My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr Foreman?
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
I believe we may have been duped by that rotten defence lawyer!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
By me?!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I do declare you may be right!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
We all know the waif there was making coins of ice to keep himself warm...
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
...But this lawyer lad says if he's stealing gas, he deserves a dose of poison, eh? He's been leading us up the garden path, that's what he's been doing!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I really never said anything like that.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
But what we just heard from the victim there has opened our eyes again! We've reached a decision this time, and we won't be swayed from it!
</line><line>Judge:
The court acknowledges the position of the jury foreman... ...and will duly hear the jury's findings.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? No! You, you can't yet...
</line><line>Judge:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...you will state your decisions now!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
</line><line>Judge:
I hereby declare the jury to be in one accord.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
O happy day!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(How is this happening?)</textEffects> My Lord! The defence asserts its right to carry out a summation examination!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court upholds the defence's right.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Typical... My learned friend is unable to accept the obvious truth...
</line><line>Judge:
This trial will therefore enter its second summation examination immediately. Jurors, the court calls upon each of you... ...to state the grounds upon which you find the defendant guilty of the crime of which he is charged.

<textEffects>- The Jurors' Contentions -</textEffects></center>
<line>Juror No. 1:
I'm a man of logic, me. And having considered all the evidence, the defendant must logically be guilty.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
I do agree that gas is far too expensive. I can quite understand why the man would want to avoid paying.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
The stuff explodes and it can poison you! It's absolutely lethal, gas is!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Gas doesn't come for free! It costs a fortune to deliver it around the city and maintain the pipes!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Truth be told, the tea my wife serves up for me is a little...sketchy at times.
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
If nothing else passed the victim's lips that night, there's no other explanation, is there?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hm, I do feel that perhaps personal opinion about gas and its supply has influenced decisions somewhat... ...but never mind.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(No no, you really should mind.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
The truth is, our counter-argument wasn't as unassailable as we'd hoped. And Mr Shamspeare WAS poisoned. There can be no doubt of that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then how are we supposed to turn this around?
</line><line>Susato:
I think... ...we need to establish <textEffects>the method</textEffects> by which Mr Shamspeare was actually poisoned. Our only hope is to demonstrate that to the court incontrovertibly.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...but that's surely almost impossible at this stage!
</line><line>Susato:
...If we don't manage it, though, Mr Natsume will...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Will be found guilty!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
No delays, Counsel! Proceed with the summation examination!

<textEffects>I do agree that gas is far too expensive. I can quite understand why the man would want to avoid paying.</textEffects>

<line>Juror No. 2:
<textEffects>I'm very interested in the results of this great detective's investigation at the scene!</textEffects>
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
<textEffects>The stuff explodes and it can poison you! It's absolutely lethal, gas is!</textEffects>

<line>Juror No. 3:
<textEffects>Blow too hard into a gas pipe, and you extinguish everything in the house. And then you're in real trouble!</textEffects>

<line>Juror No. 3:
What the...?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
These are... Wait, what are they called? ...Yes! <textEffects>Skin prints</textEffects> that were found at the scene!
</line><line>Judge:
Skin prints, Counsel? I've never heard of such things. The justice ministry is currently assessing whether or not to permit fingerprints as evidence in court, however.
</line><line>Susato:
My Lord, this is an exciting new forensic technique developed by the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! It reveals all of the places that Mr Shamspeare touched in his room.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
I've never seen anything like it! I mean that's black magic, isn't it?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Hm... Well, if anyone could invent something like this, it's that great Sholmes fellow, that's for sure.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I agree. This month's edition of 'Engineering Thumbs' was quite fascinating.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We found skin prints in many places that you would expect. On the table...on the costumes... However, Mr Shamspeare also appears to have been touching some very unexpected places in his room. For example, here.
</line><line>Judge:
Around the hanging picture there? Indeed, multiple handprints appear to be visible.
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
Well, I wonder... Could he have been appreciating the artwork, perhaps?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At first, my colleagues and I thought the same. However... ...imagine standing with your hands where those prints are, and you would find yourself directly in front of...?
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
In front of... Ah!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
I don't believe it!
</line><line>The gas lamp!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Though the reason why isn't immediately obvious, it's clear that Mr Shamspeare... ...has regularly been standing with his hands to the wall in front of that lamp.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Right! What have you been up to, you nut?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'd ask the court to recall juror number four's earlier statement.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Me? What did I say?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You said that blowing into a gas pipe would make the lights in the entire building flicker. And now, if you'll recall juror number three's statement...
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
What? Me now?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
When the gas worker who visited his home blew with too much force into the pipe... ...it caused all the lights and the gas stove to go out, and gas to start leaking into the rooms. Obviously, that incident was an accident. However, the simple fact is... ...if Mr Shamspeare were to have blown hard into the gas pipe here in his room... ...he could have <textEffects>extinguished</textEffects> every other light and gas stove in the building at will.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Crikey!
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
Are, are you suggesting that the man purposefully caused the gas to...?

</line><line>Van Zieks:
This curious photograph - or whatever it is - presented by the defence... The so-called 'skin prints'... Clearly, that cannot be accepted as any form of useable evidence in this case.

But, but it's an exciting new forensic technique! Developed by a great detective!

It's nothing. A mere toy developed by an amateur sleuth with too much time on his hands.

Obviously I'm talking about the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume himself!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
The defendant?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At the very beginning of the proceedings here in court yesterday, Mr Natsume said the following:
</line>
<hr />
<line>Soseki:
MY LODGINGS! THERE'S BEEN <textEffects>A WHOLE SERIES</textEffects> OF STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN MY LODGINGS!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Soseki:
Even on that fateful night, it happened. When I returned from Mr Shamspeare's room... ...I lit my gas stove and climbed into bed, but before long... ...the stove went out, AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
On the night in question, the gas in the defendant's room went out. So I ask the court...was that a mere coincidence, or not?
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
Good golly!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
So that Shamspeare fellow blew air into the gas pipe to make the man's stove go out on purpose?!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Now hold your horses there. What would he do that for?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Foreman!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
What the...?! What is it, man?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We cannot allow judgement to be passed whilst this doubt remains. It's true that I don't have conclusive evidence yet. However... ...you must surely agree...there is more to this case than meets the eye!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Agh! ......... ...Fair enough. Like I said at the outset... ...I'm a man of logic, first and foremost.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's four jurors leaning towards not guilty, My Lord. We've overturned the decision. Therefore...the defence calls for the trial to continue!
</line><line>Judge:
As the defence has rightfully indicated... ...the summation examination has concluded with a majority of jurors altering their decisions. Two jury members now call guilty. Four now call not guilty. Therefore, the jury's opinion is conflicted, and, in accordance with the law of this land... ...I hereby order the continuation of this trial.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Mr William Shamspeare!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
My Lord! How can thy humble Shamspeare serve thee?
</line><line>Judge:
What say you in response to the various revelations made during the summation examination?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
So God mend me, I do solemnly swear... ...I recall aught of either the lamp or the pipe!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
But your handprints have made a tidy mess all over the wall there. How d'you explain that, eh?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I am done with this. The dignity of this great courtroom has been sullied enough already...juror number five.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
Who, me?!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As I went to some pains to point out already... ...a print from the self-professed detective's toy has no place in a British court of law.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Agh!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As such, whether or not this man did indeed stand before the gas lamp with his hands against the wall... ...remains, at this time, unestablished conjecture. You would all do well to remember that.
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
Ah.........

</line><line>Van Zieks:
What appears to be extremely simple is my Nipponese friend's mind. You will recall that in order to check for the presence of poison in the tea, some remnants of tea were required.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Therefore it shouldn't be beyond your wit to imagine that even if poison were to have been spread on the pipe... ...it would have completely evaporated by now, making any analysis impossible!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Agh! <textEffects>(I didn't think of that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
In any case, Counsel...I fail to see what could possibly have motivated the man to do as you describe. Why on earth would this fellow have wanted to blow air into the gas pipework where he lived?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... There's only one possibility that I can think of. And that is... ...to use the leaking gas to commit murder!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...Counsel! Precisely whose life do you propose this man was plotting to end?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The answer couldn't be simpler. Now we've unravelled the mystery this far...)</textEffects> <textEffects>Mr Shamspeare wanted to end the life of...</textEffects>

If a gas lamp were to go out, it would be noticed immediately, of course. But <textEffects>a gas stove</textEffects>, on the other hand, could be silently extinguished by the killer without anyone noticing.
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
I live round those parts myself, so I know what it's like. I can tell you, trying to sleep without the stove lit is pretty much suicide. You'd freeze to death in no time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb, the landlord, has a large <textEffects>fireplace</textEffects> in his part of the residence, on the top floor. In other words, it wasn't the landlord, but a fellow <textEffects>lodger</textEffects> whose life Mr Shamspeare was trying to end.
</line><line>Judge:
Outrageous!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm talking, of course...about the defendant!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Natsume isn't the villain in this case... ...he's <textEffects>the victim</textEffects> this man was trying to murder!

Good gracious!

</line><line>Van Zieks:
The accused is actually the aggrieved? ...Interesting. However...the fundamental facts of the case remain unchanged. Namely...that the accused is the aggressor here!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? How can you still claim that?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Let us indulge your fancies for a moment and assume that there was indeed poison on the mouth of the gas pipe. The question that then arises...is who put it there.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(Who DID put it there?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The only logical conclusion is that the person responsible... ...was aware of this man's trickery with the gas supply and his intent to kill.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that would indeed seem logical. If the assailant were unaware, how would he or she have known to lace the end of the gas pipe with poison?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So now we must ask...how could anyone have known of Mr Shamspeare's murderous designs?
</line><line>Susato:
Ah! You mean to suggest...?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Naturally, the sole possible answer to that question couldn't be more obvious. Only the man whose life was being threatened could possibly have known.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
In other words... ...the person who put the poison on the gas pipe, in what was a clear retaliatory attack... ...can only have been the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah!
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 2:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 3:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Whatever Mr William Shamspeare may or may not have contrived to do... ...he was nevertheless the victim of a potentially lethal poison attack. And the only person who could possibly have perpetrated that attack...is the accused, Mr Natsume.
</line><line>Juror No. 4:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 5:
...!
</line><line>Juror No. 6:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The defence counsel's theorising has failed to avert suspicion from the accused. Far from it. In fact, now that a clear motive for the poisoning has been successfully established... ...that suspicion is greater than ever. Would you not agree...my Nipponese friend?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! <textEffects>(How did he manage to turn that around on me so rapidly?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, you must respond! Otherwise the members of the jury may very well change their leanings against us again. And this may be our last chance to gain the advantage!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What advantage?
</line><line>Susato:
Well, it would seem that somebody put poison on the gas pipe in Mr Shamspeare's room. So we must name that person now and absolve Mr Natsume of guilt!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You mean...name <textEffects>the true culprit</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:
...I know it might sound impossible. But if we fail to do that... ...I have no doubt that Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed once and for all!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(As it happens... ...one possible culprit does come to mind. <span style="color:#E16935">The evidence</textEffects>... <textEffects>The poison</textEffects>... It's all pointing to a particular <textEffects>person</textEffects> now...)</span>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution calls for the jury to consider their leanings again. I trust you'll make the correct choice this time... Mr Foreman.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
Hm? What? ...Oh, don't you worry! We know exactly what-
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There is one other person who I believe could have been involved in all of this. The true culprit of this crime.
</line><line>Judge:
The, the true culprit?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A term found only in second-rate novels featuring third-rate 'great detectives'...my Nipponese friend. But why not? This farce has gone on for so long already, I see no reason to cut it short before its disappointing climax.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Tell us, my learned Nipponese friend...what is your latest theory? <textEffects>Who is the so-called 'true culprit' of this crime?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The name of the person responsible for the poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare is, I believe... ...<textEffects>Miss Olive Green</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Miss Olive Green... Miss...Olive Green... I do feel as though I've heard that name in the recent past, Counsel. But I don't recall where...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Miss Olive Green? The woman from six days ago... <textEffects>The victim</textEffects> in the recent case of stabbing on Briar Road. An incident for which Mr Natsume was arrested, I hasten to add.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... Of course, yes! Miss Green. She was left comatose for some three days, I believe. But I hear she regained consciousness two days ago.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And I hardly need remind the court that Mr Shamspeare's poisoning took place <textEffects>three days ago</textEffects>. Given that the woman was lying comatose in a hospital bed at the time, she appears to have a rather fine alibi.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(True, on the night that the incident occurred, Miss Green was in hospital, unconscious. So on the face of it, it would seem that she couldn't possibly be responsible. But still...)</textEffects> My colleagues and I visited Miss Green in hospital yesterday. And we found her to be in possession of a bottle of <textEffects>poison</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Good gracious! She had poison?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And there is another fact that links Miss Green to this case as well. The defence requests that she be brought to the witness stand in order to explain the details to the court.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Tell me, Mr Shamspeare...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
My Lord! Pray, what be thy bidding?
</line><line>Judge:
Are you acquainted with Miss Green?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Eh? N-No, never heard of her...
</line><line>Susato:
Judging by the look on Mr Shamspeare's face... ...I think perhaps he genuinely doesn't know her. At least...not by name.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...As the voice of Her Majesty's prosecution here, I adhere to my word. We will see my learned Nipponese friend's farce through to its conclusion.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I appreciate that!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The prosecution requests a short recess, My Lord. In order to subpoena the witness and bring her here.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Miss Olive Green...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Indeed, My Lord. One hour should be sufficient.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. I grant the request.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Excellent...I hope.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The defence has made a most extraordinary accusation, I must say. But at the present time, I feel the prosecution's argument remains largely uncontested. Accordingly, I'm afraid the defendant and his culpability remain the sole subject of this court's attention. Thank you, Counsels. We reconvene in one hour. Court is adjourned!

<center>Joyful, Jubilant, Jumping Jacks!</center>
<line>
Susato:
Oh, Mr Natsume! I'm so pleased for you!
</line><line>Soseki:
Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! And Non-Locum Judicial Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress! Now, finally...at long last, there can be proof... Proof that I'm innocent, and...proof that my tea is innocent!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah! Good morning, my dear fellows!
</line><line>Soseki:
ARGH! HERR LOCK SHOLMES! May you drink my tepid tea and fall forever silent!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I thought the tea was innocent...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes, you came! How wonderful!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Please, save your derision. I know what you're all thinking. '"Good morning," he says? When it's very nearly time for luncheon...' Your scorn is written clearly across your faces.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Nobody said or thought anything of the sort.
</line><line>Sholmes:
The truth is, I was determined that today would be the day. As sleep seduced me last night, I thought... ...'Tomorrow for once I shall not oversleep! I'll rise early and be present in court to support my companions!' Such spirited determination has a beauty all of its own, does it not?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And then I began to muse on the subject. 'Why do people oversleep?' I queried. 'Why, time after time, do they make the same foolish blunder?' And the answer came to me at once. It's so delightfully simple: people oversleep...because they sleep! Well? Is that not an astute insight into the matter?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh...yes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Upon which realisation, I attempted an experiment. I didn't sleep a wink all night! And the results... By first light, I was exhausted and began to be assailed by fits of drowsiness.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Shocking...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And so, the conclusion of last night's experiment is this: a good night's sleep is quite simply essential!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think most of us probably knew that already.
</line><line>Sholmes:
What others presuppose, I prove by experimentation. That, my dear fellow, is the scientific method! Ah yes, and one more thing... Do you remember this?
</line><line>Susato:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. It's the poison that Miss Green was about to drink at the hospital yesterday. Oh! You didn't manage to...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It was a laborious task, as the bottle was near empty. But such inconveniences do not hinder Sholmes. I managed to confirm that it contained <textEffects>strychnine</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...So I was right.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Perhaps. Though of course such circumstantial evidence doesn't prove Miss Green's guilt. I shall leave the bottle in your care now. But licking the inside of the neck is not recommended!
</line><line><textEffects>The bottle of poison has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Why are you giving us a copy of this important file, though?
</line><line>Gregson:
Well...you're the ones who turned up the clue in the first place, aren't you? I'm just makin' sure things get handled in the proper fashion.

Oh, Scotland Yard's workings are so wonderful!

The Old Bailey Courtroom</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again now. Before the recess, we heard a most startling accusation from the defence. Namely, that the victim of the case we heard here only a few days ago is the true perpetrator of this incident.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A reckless, rash and prejudiced charge of wrongdoing in my opinion, My Lord. However... ...the prosecution has tried to extend every courtesy to this amateur newcomer from dubious Eastern shores.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you! <textEffects>(...For that backhanded consideration.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...A rather cold assessment from the honourable British prosecutor, I must say. So, Lord van Zieks...is the new witness present and ready to take the stand?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Ready and waiting in the witnesses' antechamber, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Bring the witnesses in!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Van Zieks:
Witnesses...state your names and occupations for the court, please.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
William Shamspeare, my liege. For mine occupation, I can say only... ...that I be a tragic victim. To be pitied.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Currently unemployed, in other words.
</line><line>Green:
I'm Olive Green. I'm a fledgling artist. ...Well, no... ...not a fledgling, really. A hopeless failure who's too weak-spirited to admit she has no talent, I suppose...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Also currently unemployed, in other words.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What a coterie...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr Shamspeare...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
My Lord, I am thy humble servant...
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid that you are no longer merely the victim in this affair. The possibility has been raised that you are in fact the assailant, intent on taking the life of your fellow lodger. The part you have played in this whole business will be thoroughly scrutinised, I assure you.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
...I would for nought else, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
And Miss Green...
</line><line>Green:
...Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
You are aware of the reason you have been summoned to this courtroom today, I presume?
</line><line>Green:
......... Yes, the officer did explain. He said I poisoned...this ridiculous buffoon.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And? Do you accept the charge, Miss Green?
</line><line>Green:
......... I don't know anything about any poisoning. And...I don't know anything about this man.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'Come, lady, die to live.' Verily, I know not thy prickly, pea-pigmented personage.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let us proceed with the matter at hand. That being to ascertain whether or not Miss Green has any involvement in this affair.
</line><line>Green:
It's all very strange. Very strange indeed. Why would you suspect me? I barely ever go to the East End anyway. It so happens that I passed by that neighbourhood six days ago, that's all. And on the night that this man was poisoned, I was still in hospital, fighting for my life.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yes, having been unfortunately caught up in the incident on the street outside the Garrideb household. An incident that rendered you unconscious for some three days.
</line><line>Green:
I was struck in the middle of my back by a knife, through no fault of my own, and now I'M under suspicion? What other irrelevant things might I be suspected of? It's all very disturbing...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm, your energies may be better spent worrying about random knife attacks, I feel, Miss Green.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
At this point in time... ...all that appears to connect you with Mr Shamspeare's lodgings is the Briar Road incident of six days ago. That's why... ...we would like you to testify formally now about exactly what happened.
</line><line>Green:
Oh no! The incident <textEffects>six days ago</textEffects>? You, you mean you want me to relive that awful accident?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, yes. Please tell the court what happened that day. And of course...we will be interested to hear from you about your movements that day, too, Mr Shamspeare.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Eh? But, but what happened six days ago is nothing to do with me being poisoned!
</line><line>Judge:
Let us proceed, then. The witnesses will present their formal testimony to the court... ...on the subject of the incident that took place on Briar Road the evening of the seventeenth of February!
</line>

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Evening of 17th February -</textEffects></center>
<line>Green:
It was six days ago, at about 5 p.m. I was walking along in the snow when I was suddenly stabbed in the back.
Coincidentally, it happened to be just outside the house where the men in this case have their lodgings.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
I was at the tavern on the eve of which thou speak'st, for I had bespoke my supper.
</line><line>Green:
It was the first time I'd been in the area. I had a little matter to attend to, that's all.
Anyway, I was admitted straight to hospital, so I knew nothing about all of this business.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Yes, a second incident inside a week at what I believe to be aptly described as 'the haunted lodgings'. One can only presume this is a most unfortunate coincidence...
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Meanwhile, you say you were not in your room, Mr Shamspeare?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'Twas the following morn when I did awaken that I learn'd of the dire events. Marry! What a commotion did the officers of the law make on the floor above mine!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(When Soseki-san was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
As suspected, there is nothing connecting these two witnesses but happenstance.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's true, it does seem as though they're unrelated at first glance. But I'm not so sure... There's something lurking in the shadows here. I feel certain of it. And this is my one and only chance to expose it!)</textEffects>

Counsel, you may now cross-examine these two witnesses if you wish.

<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
The day before the incident - exactly one week ago now - this note was delivered to your address. And upon carrying out the instructions in the note...you found yourself in hospital.
</line><line>Green:
Yes, I did! It's terrible, everything that's happened to me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it is terrible. ...If it's all true, that is.
</line><line>Green:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, have a look at this, please. It's the torn-off end of an envelope.
</line><line>Green:
Oh...is it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it so happens...that it fits together perfectly with the envelope of the note you received.
</line><line>Green:
...! Wh-Where did you find that?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In Mr Shamspeare's room.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Eh? In, in my room?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare... ...do you perhaps remember this note from somewhere?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Uh...well...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your actions that afternoon follow the instructions in the note to the letter. 'Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th.' And so that's exactly where you went.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Let me ask you again, Mr Shamspeare... You <textEffects>already knew</textEffects> about this note, didn't you?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And you, Miss Green!
</line><line>Green:
Ah! What did I do?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As this torn-off end of the envelope proves... ...the note was originally in Mr Shamspeare's room. So how is it that it came to be <textEffects>in your possession</textEffects>?

I, I don't have the first idea. I'm just a fledgling artist, after all.

Very well then, witnesses. You will give formal testimony again now... ...on the subject of this curious anomaly regarding the note Miss Green claims to have received!

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects>
<textEffects>- The Anomaly of the Note -</textEffects></center>
<line>Shamspeare:
I do remember now. 'Twas a week ago, peradventure, that note was deliver'd unto me.
On the day writ therein, I did tarry a long hour at The Slug and Salad, yet nobody came.
Thereafter, on the evening I shared the company of the Japanese fellow, I did see the note had vanish'd.
</line><line>Green:
I don't know what you mean. You think I snuck into this man's room, do you? Why would I?
I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmmm... You now claim to have received this letter, do you, Mr Shamspeare?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Faith, 'tis so, My Lord! And I would swear to have set it upon the table in my humble lodgings. Yet...'tis clear to me now that since I return'd from the tavern that night, I have not laid eyes upon it.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Well, that being the case... Young lady, it would appear that your testimony was-
</line><line>Green:
A lie? Is that what you think? How unfair of you to think I'm the one lying!
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon?!
</line><line>Green:
I'm just a fledgling artist, as I said, and fledgling artists don't lie. That note was delivered to me at my address! Besides... ...we all know who the liar around here is!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If that's true, Miss Green, how do you explain the facts? This part of the envelope was, without question, found in Mr Shamspeare's room.
</line><line>Green:
I don't see why I should explain.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Green:
I'm a fledgling artist. My job here is just to say what happened, that's all. It's your job to give the explanations and the proofs. You, the fledgling lawyer.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The fledgling will do his best...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Evidently, my learned friend's cross-examination is our only hope of learning the truth.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm ready, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then! The defence will now proceed with the cross-examination of the witnesses!
</line><line>Susato:
Miss Green clearly did break into Mr Shamspeare's room. There can be no question of that. And that's how she acquired the note.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Two facts that are starting to lead me to a possible explanation for all of this... <textEffects>(And it's not a pretty one.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Green:
<textEffects>I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it.</textEffects> 
</line>

<line>Susato:
It's clear that Miss Green did in fact break into Mr Shamspeare's room, isn't it? And that's where she found this letter.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Two more-or-less foregone conclusions that lead me to one terrifying conclusion.
</line><line>Susato:
Terrifying?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm afraid to say... ...that the outcome of this cross-examination may well change how we look at this case completely.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Yesterday at the hospital, we saw you with this bottle. And though the contents spilt during the course of our meeting, a small quantity remained.
</line><line>Green:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
According to the defence's independent analysis... <textEffects>(Mr Sholmes's chemistry set...)</textEffects> ...the liquid that was still in the bottle was identified...as strychnine.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?! Strychnine?! The very same poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ah?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, you broke into this man's lodgings... ...for one reason, and one reason alone: To cover the end of the pipe that feeds the gas lamp in Mr Shamspeare's room with poison!
</line><line>Green:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Can, can this be...?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
You...broke into my room...to...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It may seem incredible to the court... ...but from the remaining clues, there is only one logical conclusion that we can reach. The person who attempted to take Mr Shamspeare's life with poison...was you, Miss Olive Green!
</line><line>Green:
Oh dear... Oh dear... Oh...dearie... ...MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
</line><line>Judge:
Or-Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, are you seriously suggesting this woman put poison on the end of the gas pipe with intent to kill?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. There's no other way to explain the facts.
</line><line>Judge:
But if Miss Green did indeed set this odious trap six days ago... ...and the victim had put his mouth to the pipe that very evening as expected... ...the attempted murder would have happened <textEffects>six days ago</textEffects>, surely?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Erm...well... <textEffects>(That's a very good point...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Van Zieks:
......... Perhaps not, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
There was a significant police presence in the area that evening, on account of the incident on Briar Road. Local residents were being interviewed throughout the night as part of the ongoing inquiry. A circumspect criminal would likely have chosen not to carry out any wrongdoing at that time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Lord...van Zieks...
</line><line>Susato:
And of course, the following morning, there was more activity at Mr Shamspeare's address.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
More activity? ...Ah! Yes! You mean his fellow lodger, Mr Natsume, being arrested on suspicion of murder.
</line><line>Susato:
That's right. And as the defence has already proposed... ...Mr Shamspeare was meddling with the gas in the pipe for a very sinister reason himself: To cause the gas stove in Mr Natsume's room to go out, thereby asphyxiating the occupant.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But once Mr Natsume had been arrested, his room was under constant surveillance by the police. In the circumstances, Mr Shamspeare had no reason to blow air into the gas pipe.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
His intended victim being in a prison cell... With the need to tamper with the gas removed, the poison on the pipe lay dormant.
</line><line>Susato:
And then...three days ago now, the situation changed again.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Right! Mr Natsume's trial, which took place here at the Old Bailey, came to an end.
</line><line>Judge:
The trial in which the man stood accused of stabbing Miss Green in the back...but was duly acquitted.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That resulted in Mr Natsume returning to his lodgings for the first time in two days. And that very night, his gas stove mysteriously went out, and Mr Shamspeare was mysteriously poisoned.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Uhhh... Umm...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In conclusion, the poison that was present on the mouth of the gas pipe... ...had been put there in the victim's room some four days earlier!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
......... MAAAAAAAAAAAARRY!!!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
With that new understanding... ...it becomes clear that this letter was all part of the plan.
</line><line>Judge:
What plan?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The court will recall that the note gave instructions to visit The Slug and Salad at five o'clock. And that the recipient should tell nobody else. ...The reason for those instructions are now clear.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
To ensure that the lodger <textEffects>would not be at home</textEffects> at the stated time.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
To...make sure I wasn't home...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly. While you were out, Miss Green could safely slip into your room... ...knowing that she wouldn't be disturbed.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
You, you mean to say...that letter...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Was written by Miss Green, yes. And in order to cover her tracks, she took it away with her when she left... ...just after she smeared poison over the mouth of the gas pipe in your room!
</line><line>Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! What do you have to say for yourself, witness?!
</line><line>Green:
.........
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Just who are you?! Why did you try to kill me?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green's motive should be obvious.
</line><line>Green:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's all tied up with someone whose name we've heard several times already during the course of this trial.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So...that's what's behind all this...
</line><line>Judge:
You will share your apparent understanding with the court, please, Counsel. <textEffects>Which person is behind this woman's motive for the attack on the victim's life?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Duncan Ross...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. Before the defendant, Mr Natsume, took up residence in the lodgings at Mr Garrideb's... ...somebody else was renting the room. Mr Duncan Ross.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
I knew I'd heard the name somewhere else... It was all over the papers a month ago when the man died in strange circumstances at the 'haunted lodgings'.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, that does ring a vague... Ah! Of course, yes! I remember now! The young man they claimed was strangled by the 'convict's curse' or some such!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sadly, My Lord, it wasn't a curse of any kind. Nor was it an accident. The man died as a result of Mr Shamspeare blowing into the gas pipe and causing gas to leak into the room. It was murder, plain and simple!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
AAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Green:
......... Hah hah... Hah hah hah... Well...what do you know...? The world...is so unfair... Curses... Curious deaths... That's all people care about... If it's an interesting story...they want to know. It doesn't cross their minds...that real people are involved... And once they're bored... Just one month later, once the story's lost its appeal...everyone's forgotten him...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
You, you mean you...? Duncan was...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Ross was Miss Green's fiancé.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
F-Fiancé?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You may not have known until now who Miss Green really is, Mr Shamspeare... ...but she's known exactly who you are all along. Because you're her sworn enemy. The murderer who took the life of the man she was to marry!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
MAAAAAAAAARRY!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, is it not the case... ...that in order to exact revenge on Mr Shamspeare, you smeared poison over the end of the gas pipe?
</line><line>Green:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
This, this is all quite extraordinary! Am I correct in my understanding that you now accuse BOTH parties, Counsel? Each on different counts of murder?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes, My Lord, that's correct.
</line><line>Van Zieks:

</line><line>Van Zieks:
Inhaling so deeply, it appears that my fledgling learned friend... ...has taken in a lungful of dubious gas that's causing his judgement to be clouded.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Why would Mr Shamspeare have wanted to kill these lodgers as you say? You have completely failed to provide a motive to substantiate your accusation against the man.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Yes... Yes! That's right, Mr Reaper, my liege! I, I have been slight'd... 'Tis lies! All lies! I deny every utterance!
</line><line>Green:
And you'll have to forgive me, Mr Naruhodo, sir... ...but I don't intend to admit to anything, either.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green...
</line><line>Green:
I'm sure you'll think I'm being very rude, but... ...I'm not going to be sent to the gallows for the likes of this scoundrel!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But you broke into the man's room! If you didn't do it to smear poison on the pipe, what was your reason?
</line><line>Green:
......... I...thought I'd have a look around, that's all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Green:
You're right, I suspected him. So I thought perhaps I might find some evidence or something in his room. Evidence that it was him who took Duncan's life.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
O vileness! O villainy! O tyranny! O rotundity of woman! But in any case, whene'er I leave my room, I do turn the key in the lock!
</line><line>Green:
...That whole place is falling apart. The locks on the doors are no different. Duncan showed me once how to unlock the door with some turps and a piece of wire.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
O awfulness! O artfulness! O tyranny! O profanity of woman!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
We will consider your trespassing on some future occasion. But for now... ...tell the court what you found. What evidence your search revealed.
</line><line>Green:
Well...I spotted the note that I'd sent him lying on the floor. When I went to pick it up, I noticed something. One of the floorboards was loose, and underneath it, I discovered a secret hiding place.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Eh?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, we also discovered that hiding place.
</line><line>Susato:
Inside we found a newspaper cutting, a photograph and... an empty tin box.
</line><line>Green:
Ah, yes, well the thing is...when I found it... ...the box wasn't empty.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! There was something in it?
</line><line>Green:
Yes. This rather nice key.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What are you doing with that?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What the...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Every ounce of colour has drained from his face...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Give it here! Give it to me now! It's mine! I inherited it!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What was that, witness? What did you say? You inherited it?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ah! Um...no, I... Ugh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What's all this about? He <span style="color:#E16935">inherited</textEffects> that key?)</span>
</line><line>Green:
It was obviously important to you, since you'd gone to such lengths to hide it. So I took it. I don't know what it's for, but you took something precious from me, so I took something precious from you. So what if it means you can't open something now? I don't care.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Give it back this minute! GIVE IT TO ME!
</line><line>Judge:
Calm yourself, witness!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So Mr Shamspeare has tried, and in one case succeeded, to take the life of two lodgers now. Yes...his <span style="color:#E16935">motive</textEffects> for doing so...is the key to everything that's happened!)</span> It's true that there appears to be no motive to support the accusation against Mr Shamspeare...at first. But considering everything we now know, I think there is actually something that could explain it.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I need to recall every piece of evidence at our disposal. Everything we've seen and heard... Because I'm sure that I just caught a glimpse of <span style="color:#E16935">the link</textEffects> that runs through all of these events!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
In that case, Counsel, I must demand that you present evidence to the court in support of your claim. <textEffects>What is it that you say can explain the motivation for Mr Shamspeare's alleged crimes?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
That's...an official police report, is it not?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The Selden file? How did you get hold of that?!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
S-Selden...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The now sadly deceased Mr Ross...and the defendant Mr Natsume... ...have only one thing linking them: The fact that they had lodgings in the same room.
</line><line>Judge:
Well yes... We know this, certainly.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A room that was formerly occupied by Selden. Until, that is, he was arrested by Scotland Yard for his involvement in multiple burglaries.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm, I see...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it so happens that the convict Selden left behind one very substantial mystery when he died.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The some one thousand pounds worth of loot that he stole... ...which as yet, remains to be found.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...yes, of course! It's coming back to me now. It's written in his file here.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
'A Thousand Pounds Lost En Route to Hell!' ...That was how the papers summed it up.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And it seems that one particular fellow inmate was with the convict in his final moments. It's not hard to imagine Selden entrusting that inmate with his most closely guarded secret: The location of the stolen loot. And perhaps <textEffects>a key</textEffects>...to unlock whatever container the valuables were in.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
...!
</line><line>Green:
Ah! You, you mean this key is...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare, it was you, wasn't it? You were at the capital offender's side when he died, were you not?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Wh-What are you talking about? 'Tis a false charge, I tell you! A false charge!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
The name of the inmate who was with Selden at his death isn't noted in this file. But a simple telegram to the prison where he died would quickly tell us how false the charge really is.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ugh...
</line><line>Judge:
But, but even if it's true... ...why would the man be so intent on killing every subsequent occupant of the convict's lodgings?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's only one explanation for that, My Lord. It was in that very room...that Selden hid his loot!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
So...it all comes out...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. And having established that... ...all of Mr Shamspeare's subsequent actions start to make perfect sense.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
When he was let out of prison following Selden's death... ...he made immediately for Mr Garrideb's lodgings in the hope of renting Selden's old room. However, the retired army man was unable to offer him the accommodation of his choice.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Because Selden's old room had already been let to somebody else: Mr Duncan Ross.
</line><line>Green:
Ah!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Which is why Mr Shamspeare subsequently devised his gas-based plot to kill the occupant of the room. And when he was successful, he presumably intended to enquire about switching into the newly vacant room.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
However... ...a certain jittery someone had beaten him to it.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr Soseki Natsume...? The defendant of this case, no less!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you decided to use the ploy with the gas again, didn't you, Mr Shamspeare? This time to oust Mr Natsume. All for one simple and avaricious reason: To get your hands on the thousand pounds of loot left behind by the dead convict!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ugh... You... Agh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</line>
<hr />
<center>Looks like...I'm gonna snuff it... before they get to stretch me neck... Listen... I want you to 'ave me loot. Anyfin'... to stop the coppers gettin' their mitts on it... It's 'idden in the room...where I was lodgin' when they got me. 'Ere...this is the key to it. ...Take it. Always stay one step ahead, mate. See you in 'ell, I guess...Shamspeare.</center>
<hr />
<line>Shamspeare:
</line>
<center>.........'S mine.........</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
...? <textEffects>(What did he just say?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Shamspeare:
</line>
<center>...It's mine... ...That...loot...is mine...</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Shamspeare?!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
It's all lies! I...don't accept any of it! Why should I?! After all...you don't have a shred of evidence! You can't prove...I killed that fellow! Forsooth! I'm the victim here, remember?! ...Isn't that right, ladies and gentlemen? If I don't admit to it...there's nothing you can do! You can't arrest me...for the time being, anyway. Verily! You can't arrest the victim, can you?! ...Isn't that right, ladies and gentlemen? I'm so close... I just need a few more hours... I swore to myself...that I'd get my hands on it... And I can almost taste it now... Do you really think I'd just give up?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(There's no question in my mind now. This man is guilty through and through!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
But he seems so utterly intoxicated by the idea of that loot. I'm afraid that however hard you press him, he'll never admit to what he's done, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... There is a way.
</line><line>Susato:
Pardon?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's one way I can finish him.
</line><line>Susato:
No!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He's already committed the most heinous crimes to get his hands on that loot. Which means all we need to do, is find it first!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
A fine plan... ...were it not for the fact that the police thoroughly searched the room following the death of Mr Ross. If it's there at all, it must be very well hidden indeed.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmmm... Without conclusive evidence, I certainly cannot rule.
</line><line>Susato:
If only... If only there was some way we could find the convict's loot quickly...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(This is the final piece in this complex puzzle. But I think we might have it in our possession already. Or rather, I think we may well have something that can help us find where that loot is hidden!)</textEffects> My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The defence would like to make a proposal. About how to find the late convict's hidden loot. I believe we are already in possession of something that could give us <textEffects>a clue</textEffects> as to its whereabouts!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
...!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's our last chance... So it has to be worth a gamble. Besides...  ...we've used the same technique once already, and it definitely paid off then!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then, Counsel, let the court hear your idea! <textEffects>What do you propose we can use in order to locate the hiding place of the deceased convict's haul?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
If I'm not mistaken... ...those are Mr Shamspeare's handprints on the wall of his lodgings...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. Exposed as a result of the defence's independent investigation of the scene.
</line><line>Susato:
Based on a wonderful new discovery in the field of forensic science by the great detective, Mr Sholmes!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
A great detective? Is that some kind of joke? Do you really think I'm going to be daunted by a man with such a ridiculous title?
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>I should think the 'great bard' ought to recognise such a title when he hears one, Mr 'Sham'-speare!</center>
<line>
Sholmes:
Perhaps we should compete for the honour of most ridiculous title?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAH! 'Tis Herlock Sholmes himself!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
What are you doing here...great detective? You usual haunts are the filthy backstreets of the capital, are they not?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, Mr Reaper! It's been too long. And I see your complexion has worsened since last we met.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes! <textEffects>(He DOES know Lord van Zieks then... Well enough to say something like that, in any case.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr Sholmes... ...though you may be heralded as a great detective by the population at large... ...that does not give you the right to come and go in my courtroom as you see fit.
</line><line>Susato:
If I may, My Lord... ...Mr Sholmes's newly developed scientific method has helped us to uncover vital clues in this case already.
</line><line>Judge:
Clues, you say?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I call them 'skin prints', My Lord. My method identifies every location touched by an individual under scrutiny. It's the method by which we were able to ascertain this gentleman's gas pipe 'activities'.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
You need only a small sample of something the individual has previously touched to make an indicator solution. In your case, sir, I used the teacup you had been holding. Elementary! So now...Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
What am I to use as a sample to make the indicator solution this time?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you for offering to help, Mr Sholmes! <textEffects>(When the convict was arrested, he was living in what is now Soseki-san's room. We need a sample to help locate Selden's loot that's hidden in his old room. What form will the sample take?)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ryunosuke:
Have a look at THIS!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm... As far as I'm able to ascertain... ...you have very little confidence in your choice.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?! Why, why would you think that?
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear fellow, once again there is no mystery. Did you really believe that the minute deflection of your left eye would escape my attention?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But...but... ...I asked you to look at the evidence, not my eye!
</line><line>Susato:
I think we need to reconsider this from the start, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Why do I feel as though Susato-san is studying my left eye now...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm ready and waiting, Mr Naruhodo. The rest is in your hands!

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Ryunosuke:
We will need something of Selden's in order to create the indicator solution to find his loot. And something the convict owned happens to be...in the possession of somebody listed in the Court Record.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, your powers of reasoning appear to be on the up. So...which particular person do you have in mind? <textEffects>From whom can we obtain a possession of the late convict, Selden, to create the indicator solution?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Green!
</line><line>Green:
Ah! M-Me? What do you want with me?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The key around your neck...if you please.
</line><line>Green:
Sorry?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That key belonged to Selden. There will be remnants of <textEffects>secretions from the man's skin</textEffects> on its surface that we can use.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Very true.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That is the sample we need! Using it we can create the indicator solution required for Mr Sholmes's Skin Print Seeker... ...and find out exactly what Selden touched in the room that he used to rent!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Mr Shamspeare...as one 'great' to another, I assure you... ...if the late convict's haul is hidden somewhere in his former lodgings... ...I shall uncover it in no more than thirty minutes.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ugh...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, Mr Shamspeare... ...the truth is well within our grasp now. And as such... ...you will never get your hands on Selden's stolen wealth!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ugh...ugh...arrrgh!
</line><line>Green:
In that case... ...I'll gladly let Mr Sholmes have this key.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
No! Give the key to me! The detective shan't have it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's over, Mr Shamspeare!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
No... No...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're out of options now. There's only one thing left for you to do: Admit your guilt!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Woe.........
</line>
<center>O sham-ful spear! Despair... ...be thy name!</center>
<hr />
<line>Shamspeare:
......... I never intended to kill the man. I just... I just wanted to drive him out of the room, that's all.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So you'd have time to find the convict's haul of stolen goods?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Yet after you'd killed the young man, you still didn't move into the room...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
I asked the landlord, of course. I pleaded with him. But he refused.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Why?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
I was three months behind with the rent, for one thing.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Mr Garrideb really has had a lot to put up with...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Shamspeare:
And he had the gas repair work done immediately afterwards, putting the room out of action for a while. And then...this Japanese man swooped in at just the right moment to sign the new lease.
</line><line>Susato:
Poor Mr Natsume. What unfortunate timing...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
......... Then five days ago... ...after the incident on Briar Road when the Japanese fellow got himself arrested... ...I thought I'd finally have my chance. But it wasn't to be.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
No, the scene was sealed off and guarded by the police night and day.
</line><line>Susato:
And...if I remember rightly... ...Mr Sholmes spent the whole day in there reading books.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
I couldn't even enter the room, let alone search for the loot.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which is why, on the day Mr Natsume was acquitted and returned to his room... ...you once again tried your trick of blowing air into the gas pipe that feeds the stove in his room.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
Unbeknownst to you, however, that action would lead you into a deadly trap.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
.........
</line><line>Green:
......... William Shamspeare... How does it go? 'To be, or not to be. That is the question.'
</line><line>Van Zieks:
From Shakespeare's Hamlet. Act Three, Scene One.
</line><line>Green:
Well let me tell you, in your case... ...it's not to be. That is the answer. You deserve to die for what you've done.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
......... Haah... Urrrngh...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Green:
At first...I really did think it was just a terrible accident. I'll never forget our conversation the night before Duncan died...
</line>
<hr />
<line>The gas supply in my new lodgings are a complete disaster, you know, Olive.
</line><line>The gas supply?
</line><line>Yes. The stove always seems to go out in the middle of the night for some reason. That's no joke. They say it's the convict's curse!
</line><line>Oh, Duncan! Please! Don't stay there! I don't care how cheap it is!
</line><line>Alright then, if it's that important to you, I'll start looking for a new place.
</line><line>There are spare rooms at my house. Why don't you leave that horrible room tonight?
</line><line>No, I'd better not. We said we'd wait until we'd graduated before we told our parents, remember?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Green:
...But that was the last time we ever spoke. That very night, he fell victim to the gas. If only I'd known it was going to happen, I'd have insisted he left that horrible room that instant! But instead, all I've been left with is bitter regret. I stopped going to school... ...but something kept drawing me back to the house on Briar Road. I saw a stooped Eastern-looking man with a moustache coming out of the house one day when I was there. He walked up the road to Grub's Grubbery for some food, so I followed him... ...and I sat myself down next to him. He had some watery-looking soup and started to pick a quarrel with the publican.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Soseki:
That place is cursed, I tell you! CURSED! The ghost of that convict who used to live there...IS TRYING TO SUFFOCATE ME! I, I wake up in the m-middle of the night, f-freezing to death b-because the stove has gone out. The room is f-f-full of gas and I can h-hardly breathe... But the pipes have been checked. No problem there. It's like I'M THE PROBLEM! That's what they're thinking!
</line>
<center>But how could that be...? Duncan was gone, and... ...now this man had almost suffered the same fate. Could it really be a curse...?</center>
<hr />
<line>Green:
Then I remembered. A rumour I'd heard about how the gas companies go around investigating the gas installations.
</line><line>Judge:
A rumour? Ah...you mean...?
</line><line>Green:
Yes, everybody's heard the stories, it seems. About how they go around checking the pipes.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
How anything connected to the gas can be extinguished by blowing air into the pipework.
</line><line>Green:
That's when it started. A little flicker of doubt in the back of my mind, that just wouldn't go away.
</line>
<hr />
<center>Was it really an accident, though...?</center>
<hr />
<line>Green:
Once I'd had the idea, it wouldn't leave me alone. It plagued me day and night. So I bought this...at one of the black markets in the East End.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A...black market?
</line><line>Green:
I'd never been. I'd just heard people talk about them. And you really can buy anything you can think of there... In some ways, being able to get my hands on this so easily made me even more determined. I had to find out one way or another. Was Duncan's death an accident...or was it murder?
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And your chosen method for establishing the truth was simple...but highly effective. Smear poison on the gas pipe you suspected the man of tampering with...and wait.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If Mr Shamspeare was innocent, nothing would come of what you'd done. But if he was guilty...he would pay for his crimes dearly.
</line><line>Green:
I found out the name of the man I suspected. William Shamspeare. And then I wrote him this little note: 'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross. Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th. Don't tell anybody else about this letter or the meeting. It is a matter of utmost importance.' If he'd done it, I knew that would worry him enough so he'd be sure to go. So I waited to see if it worked.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And of course, Mr Shamspeare followed the instructions to the letter.
</line><line>Green:
I worked out where the gas pipe was straight away. So I smeared a good amount of the poison I'd bought all around the mouth of the pipe. All the time praying that the devil's work wouldn't be done, and that it was all just some wild fantasy. Actually, no... All the time praying that the devil's work would be done, and that the culprit would get his just desserts!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Three days ago... ...when you were first stood in the dock before me...this whole affair seemed relatively straightforward.
</line><line>Soseki:
Yes, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
I certainly never imagined the depths of depravity that we should subsequently find lurking behind the scenes.
</line><line>Van Zieks:
It has been a long road...my Nipponese friend.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes!
</line><line>Van Zieks:
And one I certainly didn't envisage walking...with you.
</line><line>Judge:
......... Nevertheless, together we have reached the light at the end of the tunnel, as it were. Miss Green...
</line><line>Green:
Yes, My Lord?
</line><line>Judge:
You will henceforth be stripped of your freedom... ...as punishment for the attempted murder of Mr William Shamspeare.
</line><line>Green:
Yes...I know.
</line><line>Judge:
And you, Mr Shamspeare... You will be tried for the murder of Mr Duncan Ross in cold blood... ...and the subsequent attempted murder of Mr Soseki Natsume here present.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Nrrrngh...
</line><line>Green:
......... Um, Mr Naruhodo...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Ah, yes?
</line><line>Green:
Yesterday...at the hospital...when you and your friends stopped me from...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
From ending your life by drinking what was left in the poison bottle?
</line><line>Green:
I, I wasn't myself. I can't even really remember what was going through my mind. 'To be, or not to be...' I suppose. That's a question that's so hard to answer, it seems.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Well...personally...I'm glad of your being here, Miss Green.
</line><line>Green:
Oh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I'd like to believe... ...that it's a blessing Mr Shamspeare didn't die when he ingested the poison. For your sake, at the very least.
</line><line>Green:
......... Because of you...I chose life, not death. And now you've made the truth come out at last... Really...I can't thank you enough.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Miss Green...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr Soseki Natsume.
</line><line>Soseki:
Yes, My Lord!
</line><line>Judge:
The court declares that you are exonerated from all blame in this matter. Accordingly, I would call upon the ladies and gentlemen of the jury to present a verdict of not guilty.
</line><line>Juror No. 1:
We are in full agreement, My Lord.
</line><line>Judge:
In that case, I hereby declare the defendant...
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>23rd February, 3:24 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</textEffects></center>
<line>
Soseki:
Oh...yes... Yes... At last...
</line>
<center>Divine Justice Duly Done!</center>
<line>
Sholmes:
Divine...justice? My dear fellow, if there were any divine justice in this world, you would shave that moustache.
</line><line>Soseki:
NO! This...HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MOUSTACHE!
</line><line>Susato:
Some say that a luxuriant moustache is a sign of physical prowess, Mr Sholmes!
</line><line>Soseki:
LOCUM STUDENT MR NARUHODO ESQUIRE! Once again... Once again... ...you've saved me from doom!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm very happy to have been able to help, Mr Natsume. Congratulations on your acquittal. Your second in almost as many days!
</line><line>Soseki:
......... I was first acquainted with and gained affection for English literature whilst in our great homeland empire. And then, by a twist of fate, I was brought to the land that bore the fruit of that literature. Only... ...the city of bricks and mortar became my prison. Try as I might, I never found my feet here. In the end, I confined myself to my room and lived life through friendly old books...
</line><line>Susato:
You've had such a difficult time, haven't you...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, but a week ago now... ...I dragged you out of that dark and dingy room of yours, did I not?
</line><line>Soseki:
You did, you did. And I've seen more of life in this week than in all my years to date. And for the first time... ...I feel I've begun to see the true face of the English that's so far been hiding from me behind the wall of fog.
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear fellow...there is nothing special about the true face of the English as you put it. Wheresoever one goes in the world, humans are human. There are few genuine differences.
</line><line>Soseki:
Yes, I think you're right. I've finally started to see that. And...I've come to understand something. I've worked out why I was attracted to English literature in the first place. It made me see... ...that whatever our nationality, we humans all have the same hopes and fears. We're all just doing our best to live.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well said. I've come to feel the same way.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Soseki:
......... I've made a decision, too. I'm going to cut short my study tour here and return to Japan!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?!
</line><line>Susato:
Just when we'd become friends here in England... What a terrible shame!
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh, I know. That does tug at my heartstrings, it really does. But I've decided I'd like to take everything I've learnt here in Britain and write something of my own. A...novel of sorts, I suppose.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my! So you'll be creating your own literature, Mr Natsume?! How wonderful!
</line><line>Soseki:
Oh! Well! No! I mean... I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO CALL IT LITERATURE!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why not? When that is precisely the definition, Mr Moustache?
</line><line>Soseki:
.........I suppose you're right, yes. It will, in a way, be literature... But as of now, all I know is that I'd like to try my hand at writing. I have no delusions of grandeur.
</line><line>Susato:
I for one would love to read your work!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, all things considered, it may be for the best. After all, you have once again emerged victorious... ...from a battle with the Reaper.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! <textEffects>(That's very true...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
And there is no salvation for a person in the dock when the Reaper is the prosecutor...
</line><line>Sholmes:
The desire to return posthaste to the perceived safety of your homeland...is one I quite understand.
</line><line>Susato:
My goodness, yes! Faced with such a terrifying prospect... ...nobody would consider that cowardly, I'm quite sure!
</line><line>Soseki:
......... ...But... But that's... THAT'S NOT WHY I'M LEAVING! I MEAN IT!

<hr />
<center>And that was the case that we found ourselves embroiled in six months ago now. Soseki-san did indeed return to Japan, and submitted a report about both cases to the government. It was on reading that report, that Professor Mikotoba was prompted to visit the scholar. And barely any time later, Susato-san was given the news that she must return to Japan as well... ...on the back of a telegram stating falsely that her father had fallen gravely ill. The only possible explanation that comes to mind... ...is what happened after the trial, on the following day. The day that we uncovered the 'loot', hidden by the now deceased convict in his former lodgings...</center>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>24th February, 10:13 a.m.
Mr Natsume's Room</textEffects></center>
<line>
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Sholmes! How simply marvellous of you! To uncover the secret hiding place in just one day...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Wasn't it supposed to take thirty minutes?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
As I believe I told you, my dear fellows...skin prints are extremely useful in such situations. Wouldn't you agree, Gregson?
</line><line>Gregson:
.........
</line><line>Iris:
Gregsy's been happily munching in agreement this whole time you know, Hurley!
</line><line>Susato:
Happily? I think perhaps 'humourlessly' might be closer to the truth...
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, it transpires the man fashioned a hiding place in the ceiling.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And what's in it? What exactly is the 'loot'?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Let us look then, if you're ready. Let's examine the late burglar's haul...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What the...? What is that?
</line><line>Susato:
It...looks to be some sort of neckband or <textEffects>collar</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A collar?! It's huge, though!
</line><line>Iris:
And look at all the gemstones set in it! I can see why it was claimed to be worth a thousand pounds! ...Perhaps I could have it as a belt...
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! Have you noticed on the inside there? There are some <textEffects>dark stains</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... You, you don't think... ...they could be <textEffects>blood</textEffects>, do you? <textEffects>(I mean, there's quite a lot of it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Iris:
...On second thoughts, perhaps I won't have it as a belt.
</line><line>Susato:
Then of course there's this <textEffects>emblem</textEffects> here... A large letter 'B' and a small crown...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What does it signify, do you think?
</line><line>Iris:
Oh! I, I hadn't noticed that! Hm... I feel as though I've seen that emblem somewhere before, you know... Where could it have been...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
That's enough of that, I think.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? <textEffects>(What's the matter with Mr Sholmes? All the colour has drained from his face...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, Inspector, I believe you ought to be taking this, oughtn't you? It could be valuable evidence, after all. It must be kept safely under lock and key.
</line><line>Gregson:
Ah... Yes... Get your grubby hands off that, you lot! And hand it over. NOW!
</line>
<hr />
<line><textEffects>(I'd never seen a collar that large before. And all those jewels certainly looked to be extremely valuable. But that's not what stood out the most to me. At least, not once I'd noticed it. Those dark marks on the inside of the collar... Those stains... Could they really have been...blood?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Iris:
Well, that was a funny case, wasn't it? But it's all buttoned up now!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And you look very pleased, Iris.
</line><line>Iris:
I am! Because I was starting to wonder what I could use as the basis of this month's story in the magazine. But this case will be perfect! It's been so fascinating!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're talking about the latest instalment of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', I presume.
</line><line>Iris:
'The Mystery of the Knife in the Mist' and 'The Moustached Man and the Convict's Curse' perhaps. I could make it a two-part story!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, I can't wait!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Um...a word, please, Iris...
</line><line>Iris:
Yes? What is it, Hurley?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm sorry, but you can't write about this case. It's out of the question.
</line><line>Iris:
What? Why not? It's a great case!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Then I shall have to insist that you limit yourself to the first of your two titles. The second must never be written. Is that clear?
</line><line>Iris:
...! ...Yes.
</line>
<hr />
<center>And so it was that the second of Soseki-san's cases became buried in obscurity. Now, looking back, I feel I understand. I can see why Mr Sholmes forbade Iris from publishing the story. It would take a little longer before I saw the link between everything that had happened...and would happen. For it wasn't until two months after the arrival of Susato-san's letter that events began to unfurl again... ...with an incident that took place at the very heart of the eagerly awaited Great Exhibition of London.</center>
