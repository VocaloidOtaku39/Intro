<line>Maya:
Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, I heard it's his successor this time...
</line><line>Maya:
Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man. He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He was a man obsessed with the word "<span style="color:#E16935">perfection</textEffects>"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
It's no good...
</line><line>Mystic Maya!!
</line><line>Maya:
Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!
</line><line>Pearl:
I was really worried about you...
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?
</line><line>Pearl:
Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?
</line><line>Pearl:
Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't tell me you walked all the way here...
</line><line>Pearl:
Of course not! ...I ran!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's... I can't... Oh my... <textEffects>(If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Pearly... What about the train?
</line><line>Pearl:
Huh? What's a... "tray-in"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I give up...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
...It's time, isn't it?
</line><line>Maya:
Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!
</line><line>Pearl:
Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?
</line><line>Maya:
Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.
</line>

<hr />
<line>Maya:
It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again...
</line><line>Maya:
Huh...? But why, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...
</line><line>Maya:
Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?
</line><line>Bailiff:
Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.
</line><line>Maya:
N...Nick...?

<line>Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared?
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(What is with this girl...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Why does he always seem mad at me!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>???:
You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Hold on. So this kid is the "famed" Prosecutor von Karma...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... see...
</line><line>von Karma:
I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Revenge</textEffects>...? <textEffects>(Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!
</line><line>von Karma:
I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...)</textEffects> Yeow!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...
</line><line>von Karma:
Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is "perfection". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.
</line><line>Judge:
V-Very well... What is the defense's position?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Does the defense wish to enter a plea of "not guilty"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes.
</line><line>von Karma:
Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the "<textEffects>justified self-defense</textEffects>" plea in no time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Justified self-defense</textEffects>"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself. We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...)</span> The defense stands by the plea of "<textEffects>not guilty</textEffects>", Your Honor! <textEffects>(Because to plead "justified self-defense" is to say you did kill someone.)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
Witness, your name and occupation?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.
</line><line>Judge:
What were they doing in there?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.
</line><line>Judge:
Ch-Channeling a spirit??
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, <textEffects>gunshots</textEffects> were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.
</line><line><textEffects>Floor Plans added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So, how was the victim killed?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I was about to get to that...
</line><line>von Karma:
Stop wasting my time, then.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Cause of Death --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.
The shot was fired from point-blank range.
But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.
The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.
The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This is the victim's autopsy report, sir.
</line><line><textEffects>Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.

</line>
<hr />
<line><i>(Pressing first, second, third and fifth statements leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I brought the two murder weapons with me today.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court accepts them into evidence.

</line><line>von Karma:
The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.
</line><line>Judge:
And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...? Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.
</line><line>von Karma:
Naturally!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?
</line><line>Judge:
That is quite true... Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead "not guilty"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.
</line><line>von Karma:
See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...
</line><line>Judge:
What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to "justified self-defense"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>von Karma:
...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir!
</line><line>von Karma:
Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... Y-Yes... sir...
</line><line>Judge:
N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...
</line><line>von Karma:
I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of <textEffects>incriminating evidence</textEffects>!

<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Incriminating Evidence --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.
This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.
As you can see, it's covered in blood.
The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
I see... The court accepts this into evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!

<textEffects>(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Detective Dick Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You said that my client killed "a person who, without a doubt, was not <textEffects>fighting back</textEffects>."
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, I did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eh, um... What does it mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a <textEffects>shot</textEffects>. Is this what it means to "<textEffects>not fight back</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A-Ah! You're right!
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem that way! If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Hah.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What is with that "are you finished yet" laugh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. von Karma?
</line><line>von Karma:
It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a "<textEffects>justified self-defense</textEffects>" plea.
</line><line>Judge:
That is correct.
</line><line>von Karma:
But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected "justified self-defense" and pleaded "<textEffects>not guilty</textEffects>."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Now that you...
</line><line>Judge:
Why, that's right!
</line><line>von Karma:
Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nooooo!!
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well... Yes, that's true...
</line><line>von Karma:
Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of "justified self-defense".
</line><line>Judge:
Huh? How so?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What Transpired --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.
While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.
The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.
The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun and ended it...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Just by listening, it does make sense... However, I won't give up that easily!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover <span style="color:#E16935">the truth</textEffects>! I can feel it!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!
</line><line>Judge:
E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the <textEffects>gunpowder burn</textEffects> on this costume!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
G-Gunpowder... burn?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is what you testified earlier: "When something is shot from <textEffects>point blank</textEffects>, a <textEffects>burn area</textEffects> is left around the bullet hole."
</line><line>Gumshoe:
OH!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!
</line><line>Judge:
That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing <textEffects>apart</textEffects> from each other.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...

</line><line>von Karma:
I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.
</line><line>von Karma:
Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!
</line><line>von Karma:
...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
There is a fatal <textEffects>flaw</textEffects> in her argument, Your Honor!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Fatal...?
</line><line>Judge:
Flaw...!? Yeow!
</line><line>von Karma:
Very interesting. I would love to see where this "flaw" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! "She <span style="color:#E16935">put some distance</textEffects> between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was <textEffects>about to strike</textEffects>, the doctor took his shot." There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.
</line><line>Judge:
What is that? A folding screen?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would like to point the court's attention to the "<textEffects>hole</textEffects>" in this folding screen.
</line><line>von Karma:
Aaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like you already know what I'm talking about.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Who? Where? What?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Are these two really that clueless...?)</textEffects> The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately <textEffects>8 inches</textEffects> off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually <textEffects>squatting</textEffects> low to the ground!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Th-This changes everything!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. <textEffects>At this time, the defendant was in this area.</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
She was standing here, near the folding screen!
</line><line>von Karma:
W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's impossible.
</line><line>von Karma:
B-But why!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!
</line><line>von Karma:
Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...<textEffects>Squatting</textEffects> all the way by the folding screen...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?
</line><line>von Karma:
Nnngh...
</line><line>Judge:
Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oof...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...blast radius of disaster.)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??
</line><line>von Karma:
You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand "goatee". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...P-Punishment...
</line><line>von Karma:
Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this Detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.

That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey.

Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness?

H-How could you think...!?

The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence.

It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off center. But that's what you get with a nervous amateur.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture! This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!?

<textEffects>(This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is <span style="color:#E16935">not Maya</textEffects>?)</span>
</line>


<line>von Karma:
Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, <textEffects>Maya Fey</textEffects> during his visit...
</line><line>Judge:
Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!?
</line><line>von Karma:
She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit!
</line><line>Judge:
It's unbelievable... That she can...
</line><line>von Karma:
However, it is true. When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling!
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Mia:
I wonder if she knows what she's doing...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(M-Mia!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. That picture can't be submitted as evidence.
</line><line>von Karma:
... Obviously, this picture is illegal. But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What is she...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind.
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I... I don't have even a single witty line...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
It looks like we've been had.
</line><line>Judge:
I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, <textEffects>Maya Fey</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>von Karma:
So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. <textEffects>Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Please direct your attention here!
</line><line>Judge:
...T-To the <textEffects>sleeve</textEffects>? But... But there isn't anything odd about it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing.
</line><line>von Karma:
"Should be there"...? Aaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There was a <textEffects>bullet hole</textEffects> in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!?
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Judge:
You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Don't celebrate yet.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You like to bring down the mood, don't you?
</line><line>Mia:
Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What do you mean? And what "incompetent fools"...?
</line><line>von Karma:
If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, I see...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a "perfect case" is quite fascinating, don't you think?
</line><line>von Karma:
Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Poor Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none!
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Mia:
The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Got it! <textEffects>(Watch this, Maya!)</textEffects> Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether!
</line><line>von Karma:
Wha-Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aah!
</line><line>Lotta:
Why me!?
</line><line>von Karma:
The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us.
</line><line>von Karma:
Hey, witness!
</line><line>Lotta:
Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was <textEffects>only the two</textEffects> of them when you entered the room!
</line><line>Lotta:
Well, ya know...
</line><line>von Karma:
If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see!
</line><line>Lotta:
L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest!
</line><line>von Karma:
You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... <textEffects>(Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from?
</line><line>von Karma:
That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Mia:
Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(To "<span style="color:#E16935">turn things around</textEffects>"... That's right. Mia would always <textEffects>turn things around and change her perspective</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a <span style="color:#E16935">different angle</textEffects>! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the <textEffects>third person</textEffects> was already in the room... And what if <textEffects>Maya had left that room somehow</textEffects>... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...)</span>

Please take a good look at this!
</line><line>Judge:
...Okay...
</line><line>von Karma:
I've already seen it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you.
</line><line>Judge:
And? What is the purpose of this item?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't you see, Your Honor?
</line><line>von Karma:
I don't think you actually see what you are doing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... *sigh*
</line><line>Judge:
I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ouch, that stung...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?
</line><line>Lotta:
Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the <textEffects>Channeling Chamber key</textEffects>, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that...
</line><line>von Karma:
The defendant herself locked the door...?
</line><line>Lotta:
Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... One of a kind, you say?
</line><line>von Karma:
...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes? <textEffects>(It looks like she's catching on...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession?
</line><line>Judge:
Huh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with <textEffects>her</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, agreed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!
</line><line>Lotta:
Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!
</line><line>von Karma:
Th-Th-That's preposterous!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!
</line><line>von Karma:
N-Nooooooo!
</line>

<line>Judge:
It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is <textEffects>this person</textEffects> the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma.
</line><line>von Karma:
How. Can. This. Be!?
</line><line>Judge:
At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.
</line><line>von Karma:
My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned.

<line>Maya:
Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Yes. I felt I had no choice...
</line><line>Maya:
Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.
</line><line>Pearl:
And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah. I'm counting on you!
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah... I envy the two of you...
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?
</line><line>Pearl:
Huh? A tik-ket?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Poor thing... So sheltered.)</textEffects>
