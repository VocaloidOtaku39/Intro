<line>Will:
... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes?
</line><line>Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? <textEffects>(Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.
</line><line>Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?
</line><line>Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This isn't going to be easy.)</textEffects>

<line>Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios! Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wonder if that producer is going to come out...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(... or that director.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?
</line><line>Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.
</line><line>Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?
</line><line>Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-right. <textEffects>(She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- The Day of the Murder --</textEffects></center>
<line>Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Manella:
That's about it.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

<line>Mia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-right!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?
</line><line>Manella:
Oops! ROFL!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well?
</line><line>Manella:
Umm...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?
</line><line>Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.
</line><line>Manella:
Urk!

But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.

<line>Mia:
Well, Phoenix?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!
</line><line>Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, great. Is that all...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!
</line><line>Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-what? It's over?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!

<line>Mia:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...
</line><line>Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?
</line><line>Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.
</line><line>Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!
</line><line>Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.
</line><line>Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*
</line><line>Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4</textEffects></center>
<line>Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.
</line><line>Cody:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness!
</line><line>Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mrph...
</line><line>Mia:
Cody? Answer his question, okay?
</line><line>Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?
</line><line>Cody:
You got a problem with that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.
</line><line>Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.
</line><line>Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A very long day...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?
</line><line>Cody:
Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.
</line><line><textEffects><a href="/wiki/Cody%27s_Camera" title="Cody&#39;s Camera">Cody's Camera</a> added to the Court Record.</textEffects>

<line>Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Cody:
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.
</line><line>Cody:
...

<textEffects>(Easy for you to say...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.
</line><line>Cody:
Huh!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! A word with you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What is this "digital" camera contraption you're talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. <textEffects>(How do I explain that!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?
</line><line>Cody:
Umm...

What do you mean "or a prosecuting attorney"!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Cody?
</line><line>Cody:
Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?

So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
M-mmph!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, well... er, that's the thing...
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
"Evidence"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Here's my proof!
</line><line>Judge:
What's that? The camera...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witness stated that he recently received this camera.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I'm aware of that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm aware of that, too. Ah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!
</line><line>Cody:
Hey!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Bullseye!
</line><line>Cody:
W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Pressing, not picking...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?
</line><line>Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.
</line><line>Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-right. <textEffects>(Mia means business!)</textEffects> Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.
</line><line>Judge:
V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?
</line><line>Cody:
Umm...

The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.

</line><line>Cody:
Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.
</line><line>Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?
</line><line>Cody:
Ah!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!
</line><line>Judge:
I... I see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! <textEffects>(No... wait... no way!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?
</line><line>Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, your honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.
</line><line>Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!
</line><line>Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. <textEffects>He couldn't handle the truth!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!
</line><line>Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?
</line><line>Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was <textEffects>the murderer</textEffects>, not the victim!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not <textEffects>the killer</textEffects>, he was <textEffects>the victim</textEffects>! Don't you see? <textEffects>Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.
</line><line>Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... don't know.
</line><line>Cody:
... I get it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
?
</line><line>Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?
</line><line>Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Data?
</line><line>Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!
</line><line>Phoenix:
! W-what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!
</line><line>Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!
</line><line>Judge:
Now!
</line><line>Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.
</line><line>Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.
</line><line>Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia? What?
</line><line>Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?
</line><line>Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!
</line><line>Judge:
I see... a gate?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to <textEffects>the number</textEffects> on that gate?
</line><line>Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "<textEffects>2</textEffects>."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Clearly not a "<textEffects>1</textEffects>," Your Honor, correct?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "<textEffects>1</textEffects>" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! <textEffects>(Show the judge where the murder took place!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.
</line><line>Judge:
I see! That would explain the "<textEffects>2</textEffects>" on the gate in the photo.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!
</line>



<line>Judge:
O-order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! <textEffects>The victim</textEffects>! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is it.
</line><line>Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "<textEffects>sleeping pills</textEffects>."
</line><line>Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!
</line><line>Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.
</line>



<line>Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm...
</line><line>Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.
</line><line><textEffects>Empty Bottle given to the judge.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's <i>[sic]</i> testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's a lot of homework!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mm?
</line><line>Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!

<line>Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one!
</line><line>Mia:
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-me too!
</line><line>Will:
Really? You both seemed so... so confident!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.
</line><line>Mia:
Me too!
</line><line>Will:
D-dead!?
</line><line>Mia:
Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.
</line><line>Will:
Are you sure?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wasn't kidding...)</textEffects> Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!
</line><line>Will:
R-right! Thanks! *sniff*
