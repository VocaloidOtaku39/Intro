<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, isn't it about time you told me what this is all about? Why did you bring me to this museum with you?
</line><line>Ray:
You're not busy now, are you Miles? I thought it would be nice if we could share the romance of the constellations together.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I beg your pardon, but I would like to leave.
</line><line>Ray:
Sorry, sorry. It was just a joke. Do you know about the final case your father worked on? The "<textEffects>IS-7 Incident</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... Manfred von Karma showed it to me immediately after I became a prosecutor. I reviewed the case file again last night, after you invited me here. And... while I don't remember it very well, I also had been in attendance at the trial back then. <textEffects>(When I was young... I loved watching my father do battle in the courtroom. During that trial, it was my father, the defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth against... ...my former mentor, Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. And while the trial ended with the defendant being declared guilty...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
I see... So you were there too, at Gregory's final trial. In that case, I'll cut to the chase and tell you what you want to know. The truth about the "<textEffects>IS-7 Incident</textEffects>". It happened 18 years ago, during the winter... All the buildings were covered in snow, coating the entire town like a layer of frosting. And it was in this very place, that the incident occurred. This was all before Uncle Ray became a defense attorney...

<line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth. This request sure was sudden, don't you think?
</line><line>Gregory:
Indeed. We were contacted immediately after the client was arrested.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I am a defense attorney. I brought my assistant, Raymond, with me to meet our client, but...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
A murder on Christmas Eve! This is just too much!
</line><line>???:
♪ Ahh... In the darkneeeess... A miraculous meetiiiiiing... ♬ ♬ Welcome one and aaaall to the visitor's roooom! ♪
</line><line>Ray:
A-Amazning! So this is what meeting a client is like! It all happened so suddenly, I was completely surprised!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...I'm also surprised.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
A thousand pardons for startling you. I am merely expressing my happiness through song. Welcome one and all... I greatly appreciate you coming.
</line><line>Gregory:
So you're the client for this case...?
</line><line>???:
Indeed.
</line><line>Gregory:
My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I'm a defense attorney. I will be representing you in court. This is my assistant, Raymond Shields.
</line><line>Ray:
N-Nice to meet you! I... um...! I'll do my best to help you!
</line><line>Gregory:
Relax, Raymond. ...Please excuse his jitters. He's working part time at my office as an apprentice. I thought I'd let him assist me in this investigation.
</line><line>???:
So, Mr. Gregory and Raymond, correct? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(My job involves saving my clients from crimes in which they were falsely accused. First, I should determine if he is truly innocent.)</textEffects> First, I would like to know more about you.
</line><line>???:
Ah, I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Jeffrey Master.
</line><line>Ray:
What!? You mean you're... "Master Jeff"!? "The World's Greatest Pastry Chef" Jeff Master the Master Chef...?
</line><line>Master:
Yes... I am honored that you have heard of me. All my fans call me "Master Jeff".
</line><line>Ray:
Wowzers! I'm totally star-struck! I can't believe I get to meet Master Jeff!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Raymond seems to know quite a bit about Mr. Master.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Master Jeff makes fantastic desserts while putting on a song and dance show!
</line>
<center>What's for dessert today?</center>
<line>Ray:
Macaroons and waffles ♬ Light and fluffy chiffon cake!
</line><line>Master:
Happiness for one and all ♪ The sweetest temptations... There!
</line><line>Ray:
Where?
</line><line>Master:
Over there! ♬ Take a peek inside the oven!
</line><line>*ding*
</line><line>Look! It's freshly baked desserts! ♬
</line><line>Gregory:
...! <textEffects>(I got caught up in their song myself.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Wahooo! I'm so happy that I got to sing with Master Jeff! It's my dream come true!
</line><line>Master:
Ho ho... Thank you. I am happy to hear that as well.
</line><line>Gregory:
...Mr. Master. Raymond. Shall we return to the matter at hand?
</line><line>Master:
Yes, of course. My sincerest apologies for making you wait. Now, where should we start?

</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...I believe I have a sufficient understanding of Mr. Master's personality.)</textEffects> Mr. Master, before I accept your request, there is one final matter I must confirm. You did not kill Mr. Dover. ...Can I take your word for it?
</line><line>Master:
Yes. That is correct. I did not kill him. No matter what happens, I would never take another person's life.
</line><line>Gregory:
..... <textEffects>(Those aren't the eyes of a liar.)</textEffects> I understand. I believe you. Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us.
</line><line>Master:
The pleasure is all mine. I am grateful to speak with someone other than a detective.
</line><line>Gregory:
Next, we shall begin our investigation of the crime scene. ...We will report back with our findings once we have finished.
</line><line>Master:
Mr. Gregory, Raymond. I wish you good luck.

<line>Ray:
Whew, it sure is cold outside. I didn't expect it to be snowing this hard.
</line><line>Gregory:
Indeed. A blizzard like this will probably not clear up for a while.
</line><line>Ray:
But even so, this mansion is ginormous! So this is what Master Jeff's place is like, huh?
</line><line>Gregory:
If you're going to hold a contest in your own home, you would need this much space, after all.
</line><line>???:
♬ La, la, laaa~ Welcome! Thank you for coming! Eek! Oh my! Are you okay? I-I'm so very sorry! Would you happen to be Monsieur Edgeworth?
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes, I am Gregory Edgeworth.
</line><line>Ray:
And I'm his assistant, Raymond Shields!
</line><line>Kate:
Greetings and welcome, Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Please call me Katherine Hall! I am in charge of the household affairs of this estate, and am also Monsieur Master's assistant.
</line><line>Ray:
Ahhh! No way! You're the famous "Kate", aren't you?
</line><line>Kate:
You know of me?
</line><line>Ray:
Of course I do! I see you on TV all the time! I'm a big fan of "Piece of Cake"!
</line><line>Kate:
Oh, goodness! I'm glad to hear that you're a fan!
</line><line>Gregory:
...Tell me, what is this "Piece of Cake"?
</line><line>Ray:
It's a TV show that's hugely popular with the kids! Master Jeff and Kate sing and dance while they make delicious treats. Just like this!
</line>
<center>What's for dessert today?</center>
<line>Ray:
♪ Cookies and caramel ♬ Rich and feathery cream puffs!
</line><line>Kate:
Let's make it together! ♪ A delectable paradise... Here!
</line><line>Ray:
There!
</line><line>Kate:
Everywhere! ♬ ♪ You just open up the oven!
</line><line>*ding*
</line><line>♪ Now! It's time for dessert! ♬
</line><line>Kate:
Oh, Monsieur Shields! That was incredible!
</line><line>Ray:
He he he! I always practice along with the show.
</line><line>Gregory:
..... <textEffects>(Maybe I should tell my son about this show.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
But man, doing this dance repeatedly sure works up your appetite.
</line><line>Kate:
Ah! Pardon my inconsideration! I've forgotten to take care of our guests! Please relax and have some tea.
</line>
<center>...*clatter, clatter*...</center>
<line>Gregory:
Oh... This is some fine Ceylon tea... I hear the aroma of citrus does wonders for your concentration.
</line><line>Ray:
I see... So this is what Ceylon tea smells like.
</line><line>Gregory:
Oh? These saucers are chilled.
</line><line>Kate:
Yes. They help cool the tea more quickly for people who are bad with hot beverages.
</line><line>Gregory:
I see... These tea cups also have a wonderful design.
</line><line>Kate:
Oh, thank you very much! They are one of the few pride and joys of our estate, ordered directly from France! They were made by the famed sculptor Pierre Hoquet. They are my absolute favorite articles of tableware.
</line><line>Gregory:
...You seem to greatly appreciate this man's works.
</line><line>Kate:
Yes! They are like treasures to me.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(She appears to be very honest about what she likes.)</textEffects> Thank you, Ms. Hall, but it's time for us to move on to business. Are there any details that you can give us about the incident?
</line><line>Kate:
Ah... You're right. I sometimes get so distracted welcoming guests that I forget myself. To tell the truth, I was the one who discovered Monsieur Dover's body.
</line><line>Gregory:
So you were the first one to discover the body? It is true that the body was discovered in one of Mr. Master's desserts?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... It was during the judging of the Great Dessert Contest. I heard the sound of something breaking from Monsieur Master's room.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kate:
...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kate:
When I looked inside the room, I saw Monsieur Dover's body inside the treasure chest...
</line><line>Gregory:
...Thank you very much. I'm sorry to have made you recall such painful memories.
</line><line>Kate:
No... I should be the one apologizing for not being much help.
</line><line>Gregory:
Now then, I believe it's time for us to start investigating the crime scene.
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth, Monsieur Shields. Please find some way to save Monsieur Master. Monsieur Master is not someone who could commit murder!
</line><line>Gregory:
...Yes. Of course.
</line><line>Ray:
Just leave it to us!
</line><line>Kate:
Then I shall entrust it to you. If you'll excuse me, I have to continue serving tea to the other inspectors.
</line><line>Gregory:
Raymond, let's head to the crime scene.
</line><line>Ray:
Yes, sir! Mr. Edgeworth!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>December 24, 6:30 PMContest VenueMaster's Room</textEffects></center>
<line>Ray:
Wow! This whole thing is made of chocolate! I can't believe I'm actually seeing Master Jeff's desserts up close!
</line><line>Gregory:
Were this not the scene of a murder, I admit, I too would have delighted in this occasion.
</line><line>Ray:
Uuugh... Now that you've reminded me it's a murder scene, I'm getting shivers down my spine.
</line><line>Gregory:
...Perhaps it's because this room is cold to begin with?
</line><line>Ray:
Now that you mention it, this room really is cold. *A-ACHOO*
</line><line>???:
...Never expected the defense attorney to show up so early.
</line><line>Gregory:
Pleased to meet you. I'm Jeff Master's defense attorney, Gregory Edgeworth. This is my assistant, Raymond.
</line><line>Ray:
How do you do!
</line><line>Badd:
...Detective Tyrell Badd. Homicide.
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Badd, the detective in charge of this case... A man of few words... Mmm... Tastes kinda bitter...
</line><line>Badd:
He ate... the paper...!
</line><line>Gregory:
He likes to digest his memos in his stomach as well as in his mind... It's just a strange habit of his. Please don't be too concerned. <textEffects>(It would probably be too much to ask him not to be concerned at all...)</textEffects> More importantly... Detective Badd. Will you give us permission to participate in the investigation?
</line><line>Badd:
...Permission denied.
</line><line>Ray:
Wh-Why!? Mr. Edgeworth is Master Jeff's defense attorney!
</line><line>Badd:
Defense attorneys... plant false evidence... to try and get their "Not Guilty" verdict. I don't want... their kind to disturb the crime scene...
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth would never use false evidence to defend his client!
</line><line>Badd:
Heh... I can't trust that, coming from a defense attorney...
</line><line>Gregory:
Do the police still suspect Mr. Master, even after the investigation?
</line><line>Badd:
.....If we didn't, we wouldn't have arrested him...
</line><line>Gregory:
I believe that Mr. Master is innocent. That's why I have come to investigate.
</line><line>Badd:
Believing in his innocence... without investigating the crime scene... How naïve...
</line><line>Gregory:
...That's why I would like your permission to investigate. By investigating the crime scene, I want to ascertain if my thinking was naïve or not.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph. ...So you don't intend to leave until you've investigated the crime scene...?
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes.
</line><line>Badd:
...Tch... Fine then... I will give you permission to investigate the crime scene.
</line><line>Gregory:
! Thank you.
</line><line>Badd:
But, I'll be accompanying you. ...I can't trust you defense attorneys, after all! ...If you understand that, you... can begin your investigation.
</line><line>Ray:
That's... a lollipop?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...I'm a little surprised myself.)</textEffects> Alright, let's begin the investigation. Raymond, be sure to take notes on the case.
</line><line>Ray:
Leave it to me, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Badd:
Just... begin already...

</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd. I would like you to tell me about the state of the victim.
</line><line>Badd:
If you mean a photo of the body... Here. Look at it... all you like. It seems the victim... was <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Beaten to death - The victim appears to have been beaten to death with a blunt object.">beaten to death</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Beaten to death - The victim appears to have been beaten to death with a blunt object.)</textEffects></span> with a blunt object.
</line><line>Gregory:
Has the murder weapon been found?
</line><line>Badd:
...You... should try asking the prosecutor in charge later...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...It seems he doesn't intend to tell me frankly.)</textEffects> So... May I borrow this photograph?
</line><line>Badd:
Sure... It's not a photo that was taken by the police... Ms. Hall took a photo of the body with an instant camera when she discovered it.
</line><line>Ray:
An instant camera... Is that like a disposable camera?
</line><line>Gregory:
An instant camera is a camera that can develop its film right after taking a picture.
</line><line>Ray:
Eh! Such a convenient camera exists!?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Anyway, let's go over the state of the crime scene a bit. This photo... upon closer examination, <span style="color:#E16935">contradicts the state of the crime scene</textEffects>. I'll have to <textEffects>deduce</textEffects> the contradiction to resolve this matter.)</span>
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Scene Notes added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
Are you sure the only thing the police removed from the crime scene was the body?
</line><line>Badd:
Ah... They also took away the piece of cloth the body was wrapped in.
</line><line>Gregory:
In that case, a major "contradiction" has been created at the crime scene.
</line><line>Badd:
Contradiction...?
</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The <textEffects>bloodstain</textEffects> that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!
</line><line>Badd:
...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up... I'll check... with forensics.
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth. What happened?
</line><line>Gregory:
Comparing the photo and the crime scene, something struck me as being out of place. In the photo, the chocolate underneath the body remained intact inside the treasure chest. ...however, in the actual crime scene, it's missing.
</line><line>Ray:
! The chocolate with the bloodstain has completely vanished.
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes. Did the police remove it, or was this the work of the criminal...?
</line><line>Badd:
According to forensics... no one has cleaned upo any bloodstains...
</line><line>Gregory:
...I see. Well, that would mean someone erased the bloodstain.
</line><line>Badd:
...Who knows...

</line><line>Gregory:
By the way, Detective Badd. What were you talking to Mr. Gustavia earlier?
</line><line>Badd:
I was asking him about... the chocolate frame hanging on that wall... I thought... something was missing... I thought... if I asked someone who knew a lot about desserts... I could get an answer. ...Although thanks to your arrival, I still haven't gotten my answer yet...
</line><line>Gregory:
Well then, since you've been waiting for so long, we can ask him about it, right now.
</line><line>Badd:
...I guess you don't understand sarcasm...
</line><line>Gregory:
Mr. Gustavia, can you assist us with this matter?
</line><line>Gustavia:
I train in the arts of desserts everyday. If you have a question about desserts, please do not hesitate to ask.
</line><line>Gregory:
Thank you very much.

<line>Gregory:
Look closely at this part with the decorations. Can you see that one of them is missing?
</line><line>Ray:
It's true! It's different from the other decorations.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Hm... This imperfect balance in the decorations is not like Sir Master.
</line><line>Badd:
...Upon closer examination, it seems this frame is not the only one with missing parts. ...We need to investigate further.
</line>

<line>Badd:
All the desserts in this room each have one part missing...

</line><line>Badd:
Maybe... Master vandalized the room himself to fool us...

Master Jeff wouldn't do that sort of thing to his desserts!

</line><line>Ray:
A... A... Achoo!
</line><line>Gregory:
Are you alright, Raymond?
</line><line>Ray:
Ugh... This room is way too cold!
</line><line>Gregory:
The Fountain Patio wasn't very warm, either... This room certainly is cold. Do you want to wear my coat?
</line><line>Ray:
Nope! I'm fine! Because that's something that you promised to give me when I become a defense attorney!
</line><line>Gregory:
Heh... That's right.
</line><line>Badd:
...Why is the temperature turned down so low...?
</line><line>Gustavia:
It's been turned down in order to maintain the chocolate's temperature. ...Why don't you try opening the panel cover on that wall?
</line><line>Badd:
Panel cover...?
</line><line>Ray:
Whoa! There's a secret panel hidden there!
</line><line>Gustavia:
This control panel is installed in all the rooms Sir Master prepared. So as not to detract from the dessert's presentation, the cover was closed to conceal it.
</line><line>Gregory:
What does the panel do?
</line><line>Gustavia:
It allows you to change the temperature and the lighting in the room. In order to preserve any type of dessert, it can go down to about -22℉.
</line><line>Gregory:
...The room would be like a freezer.
</line><line>Ray:
It's set to 59℉! No wonder I thought it was cold. Detective Badd. I'm not allowed to change the temperature... Am I?
</line><line>Badd:
Preserving the crime scene... is the foundation of being a detective...!
</line><line>Ray:
But, I'm not a detective...
</line><line>Gregory:
A defense attorney can't recklessly damage a crime scene either.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Indeed, Sir Assistant. Enduring hardship is also a part of training. In order to preserve chocolate, 59℉ to 64℉ is the ideal temperature.
</line><line>Badd:
Hm... The ideal temperature for chocolate. As expected of the dessert chef...
</line><line>Gustavia:
No, it is but a trifle. This is basic knowledge that anyone should know if they're a dessert chef.
</line><line>Badd:
...So, what's the ideal temperature for candy and fresh cream?
</line><line>Gustavia:
As long as you watch out for humidity and hot temperatures, candy shouldn't melt. For fresh cream, around 50℉ is the ideal temperature.
</line><line>Badd:
...You need to watch out for the humidity and hot temperatures for candy... I see...
</line><line>Ray:
Detective Badd. He seemed a bit happy when they were talking about candy.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Is candy one of his favorite things...?)</textEffects>

<line>Gregory:
It seems our investigation of this room is just about over.

</line><line>Badd:
This should make it clear... Jeff Master is the culprit.
</line><line>Ray:
! Wh-Why!?
</line><line>Badd:
All the rooms in this mansion... were locked from the inside. And... the only way to open them from the outside, was to use this key to the mansion...
</line><line>Gregory:
...Do you know who had the key?
</line><line>Badd:
Master... was the only one with the key. ...There were no spare keys.
</line><line><textEffects>Mansion Key added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
By using the mansion key... Master... could enter all the contestants' rooms. Of course... the key could also lock his room from the outside...
</line><line>Gregory:
However, Mr. Master's room is currently unlocked.
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah... That's why I suspect Master is the culprit...
</line><line>Gregory:
...I'd like to hear your reasoning in more detail.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Why I Suspect Jeff Master --</textEffects></center>
<line>Badd:
If the body had been found in a locked room... Master would've been the prime suspect.
That's why Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked...
And to ensure that the body would be seen... Master broke the lid on the treasure chest.
After the judging... everyone was scheduled to meet in Master's room...
That would have created the impression... that the murder had occurred... while he was away.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
Contrary to his expectations... the body was discovered by Ms. Hall... ...That's my reason for suspecting Master. Got that, Ace Attorney?
</line><line>Gregory:
...So you also think it was Mr. Master himself who vandalized this room?
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah... You defense attorneys believe that justice lies in trusting your clients... But I'm a detective. If I believed every poor sap's story... I'd let the suspicious ones get away...
</line><line>Gregory:
...I understand your reasoning thoroughly. However... I'd like you to hear my thoughts on the subjects now.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph. Fine.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Detective Badd believes that he is right, but I won't give up so easily. I can't accept his reasoning... I'll have to show him evidence that contradicts it!)</textEffects>

<line>Gregory:
Detective Badd seems adamant that Mr. Master is the culprit.
</line><line>Ray:
I don't think Master Jeff would have broken his own creations! But... why was the treasure chest broken then?
</line><line>Gregory:
Hmm... Just think back to the situation in which the body was found. In doing so, we should be able to see the contradiction in Badd's reasoning.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Originally, the victim's body was hidden inside the chocolate treasure chest. Ms. Hall entered the room when she heard a sound. I think it is likely that this was the sound of the chocolate ship falling over.
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah... That's what you would think... just by looking at the crime scene...
</line><line>Gregory:
You said that Mr. Master broke the treasure chest lid himself... ...but, this photo shows that the ship's fall caused the lid to break.
</line><line>Badd:
.....
</line><line>Gregory:
If the lid broke just before Ms. Hall found the body... ...then Mr. Master, who was in the middle of judging, could not have broken it!

I... never said that Master broke the lid directly... The ship was set up to fall during the judging... I believe he tampered with the stand.

</line><line>Gregory:
Do you have proof he tampered with it?
</line><line>Badd:
No... but the investigation isn't completely over yet...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(It seems they still haven't found anything conclusive...)</textEffects> Have you found any other fingerprints, other than Mr. Master's, in this room?
</line><line>Badd:
...Yeah. There were some left on the floor.
</line><line>Gregory:
!
</line><line>Badd:
But... the victim, Dover, and Master were also among the fingerprints left behind.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Before we made our desserts, we all gathered here to have the judging explained to us. Perhaps that was when we left those fingerprints?
</line><line>Gregory:
...But, you didn't find any fingerprints on the works in this room?
</line><line>Badd:
...What...?
</line><line>Gregory:
Someone tampered with the chocolate in this room. So perhaps there are other fingerprints on it, apart from Mr. Master's.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph. No matter what we find, it won't clear Master of suspicion...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
.....Labbie! Hurry up and dust the chocolate for fingerprints!
</line><line>Forensics:
Roger that, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Forensics:
Detective Badd! We found another person's fingerprints... on all the chocolates in the room!
</line><line>Badd:
.....! Whose... fingerprints...?
</line><line>Forensics:
They belong to a pastry chef by the name of Delicia!
</line><line>Badd:
...Good work... Return to the investigation.
</line><line>Forensics:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Gregory:
It would seem that there are other suspicious people besides Mr. Master, after all.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph. I don't need a defense attorney to tell me that... I'm not stopping my investigation... We will just... go and listen to what this Delicia has to say.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Delicia... Gustavia told us about her not long ago. Is she really a "frightening woman who would do anything to achieve her goal"?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth, this Delicia lady sounds mighty suspicious to me!
</line><line>Gregory:
Mmm. It seems that it will be necessary for us to speak with her directly, as well. Detective Badd. Would you allow us to accompany you?
</line><line>Badd:
...I'm not obligated to do that.
</line><line>Ray:
What...!?
</line><line>Badd:
But... you were the one who discovered the truth of the crime scene... Fine, have it your way. Follow me...
</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd...! Thank you.
</line><line>Forensics:
D-Detective Badd, sir! Are you sure about that? Right now, that prosecutor is in the room...!
</line><line>Badd:
...Doesn't matter. Him and I... don't see eye to eye.
</line><line>Ray:
"Him"...? Who's the prosecutor in charge of this case anyway?
</line><line>Badd:
...Manfred von Karma...
</line><line>Ray:
WHAAAAAA! Von Karma is in charge!? That guy hasn't lost a case in 25 years...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Manfred von Karma... The "living legend" of the prosecutor's office...? If the rumors of his courtroom performance are to be believed... ...he's a man who would do anything for a guilty verdict. ...No matter what kind of prosecutor he is, I can only hold true to the path I believe in.)</textEffects>

Wow! A candy castle! And there are even some fairies over there!
</line><line>Badd:
This room... seems to be structured in the same way as Master's room...
</line><line>Ray:
But it's nowhere near as cold!
</line><line>Badd:
This room... also seems to have been fitted with a <textEffects>temperature control panel</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ray:
Ah, it's over by that that orange lamp, right!?
</line><line>Gregory:
Indeed. Let's not forget to investigate it later. <textEffects>(Even so... this room is like something out of a fairy tale. Is this cream-covered castle Delicia's work?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
...Where is Delicia...?
</line><line>Delicia:
Oi! Can I help you? Hullo boys! I'm Delicia Scones. In my native England, I'm known as "Ms. Delicious"!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Being called a "boy" even though I'm already 34... It's certainly a rare experience.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
B-Boys? I understand you calling me that, but... Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Delicia:
As far as I'm concerned, you're all boys to me, even that detective over there.
</line><line>Badd:
...My name is... Badd. Not "boy"...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Just how old is this woman?)</textEffects>

You! What do you think you're doing!? Conversing with a mere attorney!?
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth! A-A scary man came out of the candy castle...!
</line><line>Badd:
...Von Karma...
</line><line>Ray:
Eh! This man is, Prosecutor von Karma...?
</line><line>Delicia:
Eep! Manny!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(So he's Von Karma...)</textEffects> Pleased to meet you, Prosecutor von Karma. My name is Gregory Edgeworth, defense attorney.
</line><line>von Karma:
Bah! I have no interest in the names of defense attorneys. After all, they only exist to be crushed by me.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...What a rude man.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
That piercing gaze and furrowed brow...! Uugh... He's even scarier than the rumors say.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Although that statement was also very rude.)</textEffects> Prosecutor von Karma. Would you allow us to investigate too?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph. You think I would give information to a mere defense attorney?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(As I thought, it won't be that simple...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
..... ...However, I'll make a special exception for this room.
</line><line>Gregory:
! <textEffects>(Why did he change his mind so quickly?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
You, old bloodhound.
</line><line>Badd:
...Don't call me that. ...My name is... Badd.
</line><line>von Karma:
Hah! A mere detective, speaking back to me. ...I admire your courage at least. Badd. Stand watch and see to it that they don't misbehave.
</line><line>Badd:
Why... me...!
</line><line>von Karma:
I will not accept your refusal. Well then, I'll be investigating Gustavia's room next.
</line><line>Badd:
Tch... I'm babysitting again...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(I wonder why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together? Instead of being on bad terms, it seems like they hardly know each other...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth, now that we've got Von Karma's permission, we can continue investigating!
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes. His manner bothers me, but I am glad we can at least continue the investigation.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hold it. I also need to investigate this room... I don't want you disturbing the room... So you'll investigate... after me.
</line><line>Ray:
What!? Aren't you the detective in charge of this case? Why haven't you investigated this room yet?
</line><line>Badd:
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was a close colleague of Von Karma. I came to take over for him, so I only got to this mansion just recently.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(So that's why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together...)</textEffects> Detective Badd. Will you allow us to investigate with you like before? In doing so, you'll be able to supervise us and also ensure we don't tamper with anything.
</line><line>Badd:
You want me to watch you? ...You're a strange lawyer. ...Hmph. I'll let you stick around... a little longer.
</line><line>Ray:
Yay! You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Gregory:
Thank you, Detective Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
...But if I decide you're holding up the investigation, you'll have to leave...
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes... I understand. Well then, let's begin the investigation.

Aww... it's such a shame. We finally figured out where the rocks are supposed to go.

</line><line>Ray:
Eh? Your "<textEffects>goods</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Delicia:
Those are my popular relaxation goods.
</line><line>Gregory:
You mean... the rocks and the cloth?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! That's right! You see, they're not actually rocks, but special lamps made from rock salt.
</line><line>Ray:
Wow! So those are lamps!
</line><line>Delicia:
Ha ha ha ha! It gets even more exciting! Because, this cloth also has an amazing secret!

Thanks a lot, Baddie! And you too, Forensies!

</line><line>Gregory:
I think that's her way of showing she cares.
</line><line>Badd:

</line><line>Delicia:
We don't have time for that now, Baddie! The show's about to begin! Forensies! Finishing touches, please!

<line>Gregory:
Prosecutor von Karma. We need to talk about the case.
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... From the look on your face, I assume you've found the murder weapon?
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes... We discovered the murder weapon in Delicia's room. ...It would seem Mr. Master isn't the only suspect in this case.
</line><line>von Karma:
Bah... That's not true. Where the murder weapon was found does not change the fact that Master is the culprit. ...As long as I am here.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Why is Von Karma so sure of himself...?)</textEffects> Well then, aren't you going to explain? Why the murder weapon was in Delicia's room!
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... Naturally. If you wish to know, I'll tell you.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- About the Murder Weapon --</textEffects></center>
<line>von Karma:
In order to pin the crime on Delicia, Master used the rock salt lamp to kill the victim.
He then deposited the murder weapon in Delicia's room.
If he had left the murder weapon at the crime scene, Master would have been the one suspected.
He couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon.
Ergo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Mr. Master took the rock salt lamp...?
</line><line>von Karma:
...Precisely. I carried out the investigation myself... There can be no room for doubt.
</line><line>Gregory:
Do you have evidence that he moved it?
</line><line>von Karma:
...Hmph. That will not be necessary.
</line><line>Gregory:
Wha...!
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... If you have an objection, say it. Do you think a mere defense attorney can break my logic!?

<hr />
<line>Gregory:
It's true that the murder weapon and bloodstains disappeared from the vicinity. However, there was still one piece of incriminating evidence left behind! Have a look at this photograph, which was taken when the body was first discovered. This cloth was used to wrap the body... Doesn't it remind you of the <textEffects>fluorescent cloth</textEffects> from Delicia's room?
</line><line>Delicia:
Eep! My fluorescent cloth was at the crime scene?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hah! Fluorescent cloth...? You! Just what part of this cloth is fluorescent!?
</line><line>Ray:
I guess Von Karma doesn't know about this cloth's secret.
</line><line>Gregory:
It looks like a normal cloth at first glance, but if you use this <textEffects>rainbow light device</textEffects>... ...you can make it glow!
</line><line>von Karma:
.....!
</line><line>Ray:
Prosecutor von Karma... seems a little surprised.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(I don't think it was the cloth's ability to glow that surprised him...)</textEffects> ...One sheet of this fluorescent cloth is currently unaccounted for. Now, I'd like you to look at the color of the cloth in this photo. Don't you think it looks like the color of the fluorescent cloth before it's been lit up?
</line><line>von Karma:
.....Hmph.
</line><line>Gregory:
Both the rock salt lamp and the fluorescent cloth originally belonged to Delicia. Wouldn't it be natural to assume that this cloth was used to wrap the body?
</line><line>von Karma:
.....
</line><line>Gregory:
...Prosecutor von Karma. I believe the present conditions give us much reason to suspect Delicia.
</line><line>Delicia:
Eep! Hold it, Greggy! Do you really suspect me?
</line><line>Gregory:
I don't yet know if you are the culprit. But, it is true that you're hiding something. Am I right?
</line><line>Delicia:
Uu... That's...

</line><line>von Karma:
...So. You're saying that the murder weapon and the cloth were originally from Delicia's room?
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes.
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk...!
</line><line>Gregory:
...What's so funny?
</line><line>von Karma:
Just as I expected from you! The murder weapon and the cloth are not from her room. How unfortunate, for you.
</line><line>Gregory:
...! <textEffects>(What does he mean...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Before the contest began, Master noticed her violation of the rules. He confiscated the cloth and the rock salt lamp, and kept them in his room for safekeeping!
</line><line>Gregory:
Wha...!
</line><line>von Karma:
The victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master. And the murder weapon, the rock salt lamp, was being kept in Master's room. This should be the decisive evidence in proving Master's guilt! Defense attorney. You've lost to me before you even had a chance to stand in court!
</line><line>Gregory:
..... <textEffects>(Ngh... What's this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Wh-What? Was all our investigating for nothing... Ms. Delicious! Why didn't you tell us about your confiscated items?
</line><line>Delicia:
Uuh... Well... Manny said I'd look suspicious if I did!
</line><line>Ray:
Prosecutor von Karma...?
</line><line>Delicia:
And it's true, you all suspect me, don't you!
</line><line>Gregory:
...!
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... How clumsy of you, defense attorney.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Von Karma...! So that's why he let us investigate Delicia's room!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
And in your clumsiness, there's one more thing I need to inform you of. Two sets of fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.
</line><line>Gregory:
Two...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Yes... They belong to Jeff Master and Delicia Scones. No other fingerprints were found.
</line><line>Gregory:
.....
</line><line>von Karma:
After Master killed Dover with the confiscated rock salt lamp... ...he foolishly concealed the murder weapon bearing his own fingerprints in its owner's room. Tsk tsk... I don't even need to prove my case in court. I have more than enough perfect evidence to prove Master's guilt.

</line><line>Gregory:

</line><line>von Karma:
Bah! Irrelevant. After disposing of the body, he intended to return it to Delicia's room.
</line><line>Gregory:

</line><line>Badd:
There are still... some doubts left in our investigation.
</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd...!
</line><line>von Karma:
...What's the meaning of this?
</line><line>Badd:
It's not my nature... to leave any doubts behind. There is still one piece of evidence... that has yet to be identified.
</line><line>Gregory:
.....! <textEffects>(That's right... there are still the traces someone left behind!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Bah! Talk about your doubts as much as you want later. But... this, my dear attorney, is none of your business.

</line><line>Gregory:
No. I also have some doubts about one piece of evidence. It's likely... That I have the same doubts Detective Badd has.
</line><line>von Karma:
What...?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(This is the piece of evidence left in Mr. Master's room that has yet to be identified!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
Somebody left gloved fingermarks on one of Mr. Master's desserts.
</line><line>von Karma:
.....
</line><line>Gregory:
If these were the killer's fingermarks... ...then it's possible that the killer also didn't leave any fingerprints on the murder weapon!
</line><line>von Karma:
.....How did you know the state of the crime scene?
</line><line>Badd:
...I gave them... permission to investigate...
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
Badd! What possessed you to let a defense attorney into the crime scene!?
</line><line>Badd:
I don't recall... you telling me not to let them in...
</line><line>von Karma:
Bah... Such impudence! ...You'd best remember, Badd... Your salary review depends on me!
</line><line>Badd:
*gulp*...!
</line><line>Ray:
...This isn't good for Badd. I'm so glad I have a kind boss like Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Your salary review depends on how you perform here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... I'm surprised at what a mere attorney like you managed to uncover in such a short time. ...However, it's possible those fingermarks were Master's own thing. Because he always wore gloves while cooking!
</line><line>Gregory:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Gregory:
Do you have evidence that those fingermarks were left by Master? And moreover... there are still a few points of suspicion surrounding Delicia.
</line><line>von Karma:
Oh...? You still haven't give up on that?
</line><line>Delicia:
Uuh... Greggy. You still suspect me? I've already apologized for stealing a few bites...!
</line><line>Gregory:
...I don't want to suspect you. However, I can't easily trust those who tell lies. You must still be hiding something!
</line><line>Delicia:
Uuh... Greggy is a bully...
</line><line>Gregory:
Don't you know the temperature fresh cream must be kept at? You call yourself a dessert chef, but you lack even the most basic knowledge.
</line><line>Delicia:
Uuh... I'm sorry. For my lack of knowledge...
</line><line>Gregory:
In your case, it's not even about the lack of knowledge. In truth... you don't even know how to make desserts, do you?
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
Defense attorney! Stop trying to force your own reasoning. ...In a court of law, the evidence tells all. If you say the witness is lying, show it with evidence!
</line><line>Gregory:
We're not in court yet, but... very well. <textEffects>This evidence shows that Delicia can't make desserts.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
The only things Delicia made were those that broke the rules.
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>

The lamp and cloth that broke the rules were being held in Master's room. There is no way the witness could have returned them to her room!
</line><line>Gregory:

</line><line>Gregory:
Those were not the only fake desserts she made.
</line><line>von Karma:
.....What?
</line><line>Gregory:
Her desserts may look like something out of a fairy tale at first glance... ...but in reality, they are nothing but mannequins, decorated with cream. Apart from the cream, they're all fake!
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Gregory:
This is not something one aiming to become the world's greatest pastry chef would do.
</line><line>von Karma:
...Is this true, Badd?
</line><line>Badd:
Yes... My shoes... can attest to that...
</line><line>von Karma:
.....
</line><line>Ray:
Will that be enough to convince Prosecutor von Karma?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Once he sees what Delicia has done, he'll have no choice but to be convinced.)</textEffects> Delicia... The fact that your actions could lead to you being a suspect is no laughing matter.
</line><line>Delicia:
Th-That's! I didn't murder...!
</line><line>Gregory:
...Isn't it time you told us the whole truth? Who are you? And why were you indulging yourself in another contestant's work!?
</line><line>Delicia:
...Yessie... I understand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Delicia:
The truth is... I'm not really a dessert chef, like I led you to believe. I'm actually a pharmacist.
</line><line>Ray:
What! A pharmacist?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(That's a completely different occupation... It's no wonder he couldn't hide his surprise.)</textEffects> Why is a pharmacist like you participating in this contest?
</line><line>Delicia:
...I just love eating desserts. I joined because I thought I'd be able to eat some of Jeffy's desserts. I never thought I'd end up making it to the finals.
</line><line>von Karma:
.......
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...Even Prosecutor von Karma is at a loss for words.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
S-So that's the real reason why you entered the contest?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie... As expected, Jeffy's desserts were oh-so-good.
</line><line>Badd:
So... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... were your doing?
</line><line>Delicia:
Eep! No way! I never wore gloves!
</line><line>Gregory:
Delicia's fingerprints were found on Mr. Master's chocolates. So it is true that she wasn't wearing gloves.
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! Exactly! You do believe me, Greggy!
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
...Is your face stuffed with nothing but desserts!?
</line><line>Delicia:
Eep! Sorry, Manny.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...I think it's her belly that's stuffed.)</textEffects> Were Master's desserts all that you ate?
</line><line>Delicia:
...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...
</line><line>Gregory:
! You mean you entered the victim's room?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! Exactly. The room was empty after all.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Perhaps the victim was already dead by then...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
But my first bite tasted way too salty and I couldn't eat it! So, I ate the delicious star-shaped dessert that was nearby.
</line><line>Ray:
Ms. Delicious... You really are a glutton.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Is it rare you see a woman with this kind of appetite.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
That's all I did. Greggy, Manny, everyone... I'm sorry I caused you trouble.
</line><line>Gregory:
Now that you've told us the truth, everything's fine. There's no need to apologize.
</line><line>von Karma:
...This does not mean that your testimony is trustworthy. I'll be investigating the victim's room after this. Only then will I decide if your testimony is true.
</line><line>Gregory:
Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like to go as well. I also need to ascertain whether my reasoning up until now has been correct.
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph...! I'll let you follow, but I have no intention of letting you investigate.
</line><line>Gregory:
...That's enough for me.

<line>von Karma:
This...! What is the meaning of this!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
The desserts adorning the victim's room had disappeared without a trace. Was this the true killer's doing? A body that was hidden inside a dessert, and a murder weapon that was moved... Further investigation would be required to arrive at the truth of this case.

<line>Ray:
...Oops, I guess I went on for a little too long there.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Something like that... happened? I had no idea. None of the case files I read went into such detail.
</line><line>Ray:
Well, I doubt there would be anything in there that would be inconvenient to the prosecution. Especially with that Von Karma at the head.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How did the investigation go from there?
</line><line>Ray:
The desserts had disappeared from the victim's room, so the investigation hit a rough patch. Thanks to that, it took about a whole year before a verdict was handed down.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
One whole year...?
</line><line>Ray:
This was before the whole 3-day pre-trial system was established. Trial didn't need to finish in the short amount of time that they do now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I see. Did they ever find out why the victim's dessert disappeared?
</line><line>Ray:
Well, kinda... His dessert was like a candy ice sculpture, made from sherbet... Since it was made from ice, the general consensus was that it had melted. ...However, that might not quite be the case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Ray:
This museum used to be Mr. Master's mansion.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The stage of the IS-7 Incident...
</line><line>Ray:
And in this very place, they're exhibiting the "Sherbet Salon" from 18 years ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! The victim's dessert...?
</line><line>Ray:
Yep. Though it could be just a replica of the original. That's why Uncle Ray had to come today, to check it out. ...And for your old man, too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....
</line><line>Ray:
Now then! Let's get a move on and check out the room! I'm pretty sure it's over in the "Winter Palace." Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Shields. According to the pamphlet we received at the entrance, the Winter Palace is over here.
</line><line>Ray:
Really? I could've sworn it was this one. Alright, let's scoot. We gotta confirm the truth of what happened 18 years ago.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 2, 10:20 AMZodiac Art GalleryWinter Palace</textEffects></center>
<line>Ray:
Man... It's still as cold as ever. Uncle Ray's gonna freeze solid.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems the "<textEffects>Winter Palace</textEffects>" lives up to its name. It's like a freezer in here. <textEffects>(With the light dimmed like this, it's almost as if the room itself is made of ice...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
I think the control panel for the room temperature is on the back wall. Miles, why don't you check what temperature it's set at for me? Uncle Ray's gonna give the curator a piece of his mind later. It's way too cold in here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm... Very well.
</line><line>Ray:
But if you want to look around the room a bit, feel free to stay, or freeze, to your heart's content. I'll get the camera ready. I want to take some pictures of this place and show it to your old man.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Understood.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
According to the pamphlet, the <textEffects>Winter Palace has a temperature of 27℉</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ray:
Brrrr! Now that is cold. Uncle Ray's going to freeze to death! Guess I'll need to find someone to share body heat with. Preferably a beautiful lady.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....
</line><line>Ray:
Oh! Are you trying to freeze me to death as well with those cold eyes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course not.

Alrighty, now that I've got some pictures of this room, let's check out the other places. Might as well see them all, since we're already here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!

</line><line>Larry:
E-Edgeyyyyy! I... I saw something that no one should ever have to see! Agaaain!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Larry, calm down! Why is there someone passed out here?
</line><line>Larry:
I-I didn't do anything! He just fell down all of a sudden!
</line><line>Ray:
! This man... He can't be...!
</line><line>???:
Excuse me, but what is the matter here?
</line><line>???:
You can't raise such a ruckus in the museum, boys.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? This scent is...!
</line><line>Ray:
Seems like he's still breathing, but this is a bad situation...! Miles, it's not safe here! Get everyone out of here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Everyone, get away from that room right now! There's... poison gas coming out from it!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 2, 10:42 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio</textEffects></center>
<line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. Mr. Shields. How is the victim?
</line><line>Ray:
It looks like he breathed in a little too much of that poison gas... He's still unconscious. According to the doctor in the ambulance, there are no external injuries or any other wounds. Thanks to our fortunate timing, we were able to save him before he was too far gone... ...but he's not out of the woods yet. He's currently being treated by a specialist in the infirmary.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... Mr. Shields, is he an acquaintance of yours?
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah, you could say that. He's Dane Gustavia. He was involved in the IS-7 Incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The pastry chef? <textEffects>(So he was involved in the case 18 years ago.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
At least the other guy is doing alright. Is he a friend of yours, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, you could say that. It is unfortunate you were not hurt, Larry.
</line><line>Larry:
What's "you could say that" supposed to mean, Edgey!? How could you treat a childhood friend like that? That's just cruel! And also, when I'm dressed like this, I'm called Laurice Deauxnim, y'know. So don't call me "Larry," It's "Laurice!"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This man is Larry Butz. He's nothing but trouble, but he's been one of my friends since grade school. Some time ago, he awakened to the calling of art and assumed the alias "Laurice Deauxnim"... ...but a Butz by any other name would smell just as much.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Really? You two are childhood friends? I better report that to your old man, too. I'm sure it will bring him joy. He was always worried about you not being able to make friends.
</line><line>Larry:
Good for you, Edgey! Aren't you glad to have a bosom buddy like me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(My father was worried about something like that...?)</textEffects> But anyway, what are you doing in a place like this, Larry?
</line><line>Larry:
How many times do I have to tell you, Edgey!? I'm "Laurice"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What. Are you doing. In a place. Like this!?
</line><line>Larry:
Yikes! Don't glare at me when you talk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So are you going to tell me?
</line><line>Larry:
Isn't it obvious? I've come here to study art! I'm going to take Mandy on a date here, so I was just doing some scouting beforehand!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Aren't you just using art as an excuse to go on a date...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Not bad, Laurice! Maybe you can introduce some pretty girls to me next time.
</line><line>Larry:
Oh, now you're talkin' my language, dude!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I think I'm getting a headache.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
By the way, Laurice... Did you notice anything strange when you found the victim?
</line><line>Larry:
Nah... not really.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nothing that would make you say, "I saw something that no one should ever have to see"?
</line><line>Larry:
Oh, yeah... That. I was just surprised when I saw that old dude fall down out of nowhere like that. I didn't do anything this time, for once!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is that anything to brag about!?
</line><line>???:
Visitors, we wish to deeply apologize for the disturbance. I am the curator of this museum. My name is Katherine Hall.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She's also one of the people involved in the IS-7 Incident...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Hello there, Ms. Kate.
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Shields, thank you for your continued assistance.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She was the woman we saw at the reception. So she's the curator here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
We apologize for the inconvenience, especially since it's the opening day...
</line><line>Ray:
No, no. You don't have to apologize for a thing, Ms. Kate. Ah... I almost forgot. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory Edgeworth's son.
</line><line>Kate:
Oh! Monsieur Edgeworth's...! ♬ Oh! How wonderfuuuuuul! I meeeet the soooooon... Afteeer eighteeeeen years...! ♪ ♪ It is an honor to meet youuu! Deefeensee attooorneyyyy Miles Edgewooooooorth! ♬
</line><line>Ray:
Wow, that was amazing! You still got that golden voice, Ms. Kate.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Actually, I'm a prosecutor.
</line><line>Kate:
Oh, so you are a prosecutor? My most sincere apologies, Monsieur Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This woman is very polite, but... slightly odd.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
U-Uh... Katey! Could I get your autograph right here, pretty please?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... if you so desire.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why do you want her autograph?
</line><line>Larry:
Hey! Don't tell me... You don't know who she is?
</line><line>Ray:
My, my. You really don't keep up with the entertainment news, do you, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What...? What is this unbearable atmosphere!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
She's a superstar actress who's been in tons of musicals and movies. She's a great singer too.
</line><line>Kate:
*giggle*... Currently, I am the curator of this museum. I have already retired from the stage. I finished filming my role for my last movie a few days ago. My costars also said that they would come here once I opened the doors. ...And here you are, Monsieur Artiste. I return this to you.
</line><line>Larry:
Thanks a bunch, Katey! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!
</line><line>Ray:
Well, well. Looks like me and Laurice share the same interests.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...So I gathered.)</textEffects> Larry, you said you're here to study art. Why don't you practice drawing as well? ...Since you're here at Ms. Hall's art museum.
</line><line>Kate:
Oh! It would be an honor to have Monsieur Artiste sketch our exhibits.
</line><line>Larry:
Oh, I guess even you have some good ideas every now and then, Edgey! I'll do a bit of sketching for Katey here!
</line><line>Kate:
Hee hee... what an amusing person.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Forgive the disturbance. Incidentally, who was the woman that was with you earlier?
</line><line>Kate:
That was Madame Delicia Scones. She is currently assisting in the treatment of Monsieur Gustavia in the infirmary. Even though I said "infirmary", since this is an art museum now, it is only provisional. As I am the only staff member working here, I cannot take a leave of my duties for too long.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Delicia Scones... I believe we have heard that name before, Mr. Shields.
</line><line>Ray:
Yep. Looks like the whole gang from the IS-7 Incident is here. Well. ...I doubt that's a coincidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Kate:
...Monsieur Shields. Monsieur Edgeworth. Would you care for some hot tea?
</line><line>Ray:
Oh! Ms. Kate's tea. That takes me back.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, if you please.
</line>
<hr />
<center>...*clatter, clatter*...</center>
<hr />
<line>Kate:
Now, I must take my leave. I must explain the situation to the other visitors.
</line><line>Ray:
Alright, thanks for everything.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This smells like... Ceylon tea. I should drink it before it cools.)</textEffects> Oh... This Ceylon tea is of very high quality. And this aroma of citrus...
</line><line>Ray:
"Does wonders for your concentration," right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
He he he, your old man said the exact same thing 18 years ago. But the saucers back then were chilled. Today they're warm.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm. A-Anyway... Don't you think this current situation is rather unusual?
</line><line>Ray:
You mean how everyone involved in the case 18 years ago has gathered at this museum?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. I would like to be in charge of this case, if at all possible...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!?
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Shields! I came here as fast as I could when I heard that you were done in by the poison gas!
</line><line>Ray:
Ohh! My sweet honey Kay! How about a hug after being parted for so long?
</line><line>Kay:
No. Geez! So you're perfectly fine? I can't believe you made us worry so much!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe... What is the meaning of bringing Kay here?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-I'm sorry, sir! I knew the gas was dangerous, so I tried to stop her... But no matter how much I ran and ran and and ran and ran, I couldn't gain any ground...
</line><line>Kay:
...He he heh, when it comes to running away, no one is faster than the Yatagarasu!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(But you weren't running away from here...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, I'm all set, sir! I'll start investigating the crime scene! Since there might still be traces of gas in the room, I'll have to ask everyone to wait here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. I'm counting on you.
</line><line>Ray:
Good luck in there, flatfoot!
</line><line>Kay:
Wow. Gummy's so cool! He's just like a detective!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...But that's what he is...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, Edgeworth here.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Mr. Edgeworth! It looks like the poison gas has dissipated, sir!</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Detective, calmly explain the state of the Autumn Palace.</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yessir! I'll start with the exhibits. On the left, there's a statue with two people. And on the right, there's a statue of an animal with two horns.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A statue of two people and a statue of an animal with horns... Isn't that the exact same thing I saw in the Winter Palace just a while ago...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Also, the room is wet with water thanks to the sprinkler system! That also prevented the gas from harming everyone else.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>The sprinkler system... Was there a fire in the room?</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
There are no signs of a fire, and the fire alarm hasn't gone off either, sir. The sprinklers in this museum are the kind that detects both smoke and fire. If it detects smoke, it will send an alert to the security room. I think the poison gas might have set off the alarm in the security room, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was there anyone in the security room at the time?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The only one working here is the curator, Ms. Katherine Hall, sir. She has been in the reception booth, opposite the security room ever since the museum opened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did Ms. Hall turn on the sprinklers?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The sprinkler system can only be operated manually from the security room, sir. If it had been automatic, it would have sprayed water all over the exhibits. Since the system is manual, the situation can be examined and the exhibits moved if need be.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I guess there would be more priority over the exhibits than the building. Only at a museum.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Brrrr... But it's way too cold in this room, sir! Isn't this supposed to be the Autumn Palace? It feels more like the dead of winter in here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>The Autumn Palace... is "cold"?</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I checked the thermostat earlier, and it was set to 27℉! I couldn't believe it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why would the Autumn Palace be set to the same temperature as the Winter Palace...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's about all I know for now, sir. If I figure out anything else, I'll give you another call!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>I see. I'm counting on you, Detective.</textEffects>

<line>Kay:
What did Gummy say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...He said it feels more like winter in the Autumn Palace.
</line><line>Kay:
? I don't get it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I haven't been able to enter the room personally... ...but it should be possible to look inside ater the police have finished investigating.
</line><line>Ray:
Hmm. I'd like to know what it's like in there myself.
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't there anyone else who knows about the incident?
</line><line>Ray:
Aah! There is someone! Miles' friend, right!
</line><line>Kay:
Friend...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Though he's such a nuisance, we have no choice but to listen to what he has to say for now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Wait, you mean...!
</line><line>Larry:
Oh! You're here too Kay! You're looking as cute as ever!
</line><line>Kay:
Eheheh. Long time no see! It's Larry... isn't it!
</line><line>Larry:
...Kay, right now my name is "<textEffects>Laurice</textEffects>"... I'm an artist, that's why.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah, so that's your pen name! Laurice, the artist formerly known as Larry!
</line><line>Larry:
Wow, you really are a good girl, Kay! ...Nothing like Edgey here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..... Larry. I have many things I need to ask you.
</line><line>Larry:
What's this! Don't tell me you suspect me again! You're gonna say because I was first on the scene, I must be the culprit, aren't you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I never said anything like that. I only want you to tell me what you saw. You said you "saw something that no one should ever have to see", did you not?
</line><line>Larry:
BUUUUT! Now I'm saying I didn't see nothing, and I didn't do nothing! ....Probably.
</line><line>Ray:
Oh my, he didn't seem so confident at the end there.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...There are somewhat troublesome circumstances surrounding this man. The saying "When something smells, it's usually the Butz" still holds true, 26 years on. One could say his tendency to attract trouble is legendary. <textEffects>(It seems he's done something troublesome, without even realizing it himself... ...I'll just have to try and extract the truth from him.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
My goal is to expose whatever Larry is hiding. However...
</line><line>Larry:
I didn't see nothing, I didn't do nothing!

<line>Edgeworth:
What was your purpose for coming to the art gallery?
</line><line>Larry:
What!? Are you saying that I don't belong in an art gallery!?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Larry:
Hey! If you're not gonna talk, hold that pose so I can paint your portrait! And then, I'll scribble all over the portrait I drew of you.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Larry:
I-I was just joking. I would never scribble over my paintings, of course. They're works of art, after all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't think any of your works would qualify as "art".
</line><line>Larry:
Don't look down on me! There are people who recognize my skills as an artist!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Larry:
Mandy is my girlfriend, but it's really my paintings she fell in love with! That's why, I'll sketch anything my girlfriend likes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then, why are you here on your own today?
</line><line>Larry:
So what! Can't a guy with a girlfriend spend some time alone!?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Larry:
Mandy said she's a Gemini. I thought she'd be happy if I showed her a sketch of it on our next date.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you really have that much confidence in the sketch?
</line><line>Larry:
Well... I'm not so confident about this one. But I thought she would be happy... if I did a sketch of her astrological sign.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I see. That's just like you. To impress Mandy, you came here to see the Gemini Sculpture, didn't you?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Larry:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAT! How'd you find out!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because you just unknowingly told me everything!
</line><line>Larry:
W-Well then, I'm not saying another word from now on!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's finally decided to remain silent. In that case, I'll be more relentless in my questioning. I'll try to find out <textEffects>what he was doing here at the art gallery.</textEffects> I'll expose his true motives. This shouldn't take long!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
You... just what did you do in this art gallery!?
</line><line>Larry:
Wh-What's with that glare...!? I-I don't really remember anything. I didn't have a pamphlet... so I just loitered around the Fountain Patio.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Don't they give you a pamphlet at the reception booth after you pay the admission fee?
</line><line>Larry:
Huh? Oh... is that right? So... the admission wasn't free, huh...?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... you sneaked in here without paying!?
</line><line>Larry:
I'm sooooooooorry! I-I didn't mean to do anything bad! I-It's just... there was no one at the reception booth... That's why... I thought you could come in here for free!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall wasn't at the reception booth?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah. It didn't look like there was anyone on the other side of the desk.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Come to think of it... Gumshoe did say something about that. Ms. Hall was busy activating the sprinklers from the security room. Because of the incident, she had to leave the reception booth.
</line><line>Larry:
Poor Katey... She went to all that trouble to open up the palace. And now, the art gallery's star attraction, the "Winter Palace" is completely ruined...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You're certainly well-informed about the Winter Palace, for someone without a pamphlet. The Winter Palace is where your goal, the Gemini Sculpture, is located... You had your sights set on the Winter Palace from the beginning, didn't you?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Larry:
Whaaaaaaaat? H-How'd you find me out again!? That's right! My goal was to see the Gemini Sculpture! From the very beginning, the Winter Palace was the very reason why I came here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He confessed quite easily... You can never tell anything with this man. Next, I'll ask for further information regarding the <textEffects>Winter Palace</textEffects>. ...He may still have some fight left in him. I'll watch his reactions, and extract the information I need!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You tried to go in... but you weren't actually able to, right?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah... that's about right. I wanted to go in, but... Then that old geezer collapsed... I was a little freaked out.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
So you couldn't get in because the victim of the poison gas collapsed?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah. He fell right out of the Winter Palace.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hm? I'm sure the victim emerged from the Autumn Palace...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
If it weren't for that poison gas incident... ...I'd be in there sketching the Gemini Sculpture right now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Larry must have mistaken the Autumn Palace for the Winter Palace... That aside, it seems his goal was to <textEffects>sketch the sculpture</textEffects>. Heh... this should be a useful <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.

<line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps I should try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...?
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not? I don't think you would give up that easily! Even after the victim collapsed, you could still see inside the room from the outside, right?
</line><line>Larry:
W-Well, I may have gotten a tiny glimpse, but... ...there's no evidence... that I saw something scary in there, right...?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
My, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple. Larry. You saw "something scary" at the crime scene, didn't you!?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
You've mentioned the Gemini Sculpture many times now, but... I don't believe the sculpture you saw was the Gemini one.
</line><line>Larry:
Wh-What!? Was it a mirage then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace.)</textEffects> <textEffects>This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Take a look at this pamphlet. In the Autumn Palace... The Pisces, Capricorn, Aries, and Aquarius sculptures are displayed. Incidentally, I can confirm that the Gemini Sculpture is located in the Winter Palace. Therefore, the sculpture you saw could not have been the Gemini one!
</line><line>Larry:
......I knew it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Hm. I expected him to be a bit more shocked at the news...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Larry:
I thought it was kinda strange. I know I saw a single goddess. ...And that transformation was no mirage.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..."Transformation", you say?
</line><line>Larry:
Oh! You're curious too, Edgey? Well, nothing for it, guess I'll have to show you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Show me? What, exactly?
</line><line>Larry:
I drew a picture of the very scene I saw back then! But, I really can't believe what I drew.
</line><line>Kay:
Picture, what picture?
</line><line>Larry:
This one, right here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh... What! What is this disturbing picture!? Is that sculpture weeping tears of blood?
</line><line>Kay:
Laurice! ...This picture is scary!
</line><line>Larry:
Kay! It scared me too! This Gemini Sculpture suddenly transformed into a goddess right before my eyes. I couldn't help but scream.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...So the victim collapsing wasn't what surprised him.)</textEffects> What do you mean when you say "transformed"?
</line><line>Larry:
I don't really understand it myself! The lower half of its body just turned into a fish!
</line><line>Ray:
A fish goddess... That would be the Pisces Sculpture, wouldn't it. In mythology, Pisces represents the fish that a goddess and her son transform into.
</line><line>Kay:
Really! So Pisces isn't just a couple of ordinary fish?
</line><line>Larry:
Edgey... you don't think that sculpture is cursed, do you? Those tears of blood turned the Gemini Sculpture into a fish.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Preposterous. You simply mistook the Pisces Sculpture for the Gemini one.
</line><line><textEffects>Pisces Sketch data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Oh. You put the sketch in your Organizer?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Even a sketch like this can be used as scrap paper, after all.
</line><line>Larry:
How could you!
</line><line>Ray:
But, it's strange. Why did only the lower half of the sculpture transform? Uncle Ray is a bit curious about what went on in the Autumn Palace.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Indeed... I wonder if someone tampered with the Pisces Sculpture.)</textEffects> Yes. Edgeworth here.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Mr. Edgeworth! We've finished searching the room! The poison gas isn't a threat anymore, so you can enter the crime scene!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Right. Good work, Detective. ...It seems we can enter the Autumn Palace now.
</line><line>Ray:
Nice timing, Mr. Detective.
</line><line>Kay:
Let's go right now! I wanna see the Pisces Sculpture!
</line><line>Larry:
If Kay's going, I'm going too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I was planning on bringing him along anyway.)</textEffects> Right then, let's proceed to the Autumn Palace.
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
So this is the Autumn Palace... <textEffects>(It certainly does resemble the Winter Palace.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I've been waiting, sir! ...Huh? Aren't you... that Harry Butz guy!
</line><line>Larry:
Wrong! I'm Laurice Deauxnim!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....Never mind that, Detective. Your report, if you please.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Roger that, sir! Err... We discovered a used gas burner during our investigation. The nozzle was still warm when we found it, so it may be related to the incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm. <textEffects>(Was it used to heat something?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Used Gas Burner data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was that ladder always there on the ground?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It was probably used by the person who set off the poison gas. The poison gas was released when someone lifted the lid off that glass case, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm...?&#160;! The Pisces Sculpture...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Seems like you know about it, sir. Well then, do you know what the sculpture next to it is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Since we're in the Autumn Palace, it would probably be the Capricorn Sculpture.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I thought it was Taurus myself. I was thrown off as it was covered by this weird cloth!
</line><line>Ray:
The fluorescent cloth! I wonder what it's doing here.

And because they're hidden, it makes me want to see them even more.

Let's take a look! I'll just get this cloth off.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow! They're beautiful!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You don't think... the "transformation" Larry saw... Was, in fact, the moment the cloth wrapped around the lower half of Pisces fell...?
</line><line>Larry:
See, Edgey! It wasn't a mirage or a mistake after all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Ray:
Hey... Miles. There sure is something strange about this room. It looks exactly the same as the Winter Palace we were in just a moment ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes. I agree. Perhaps the sculptures were hidden to make it look like the Winter Palace. If you wrap the cloth around the lower half of the Pisces Sculpture, it looks like Gemini.
</line><line>Ray:
Capricorn is a half-fish too. Hide the lower half and it resembles Taurus. The remaining two, which couldn't be altered with trickery, were covered up.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Autumn Palace was made to look like the Winter Palace. So it seems... Mr. Shields. It looks like we'll need to conduct an investigation of the Autumn Palace too.

Hey, hey, hey! You guys again!? This is a problem. You see, this is MY crime scene.

Mr. Edgeworth... it seems my power is insufficient. If you're here, then it would appear that you still haven't understood my warnings.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Furthermore... you know full well your reckless actions will cause trouble for that detective. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I must pass judgement.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You've got it all wrong, pal! I was the one who asked Mr. Edgeworth to investigate!
</line><line>Debeste:
Really? Well then, flatfoot, I'll have to do "that".
</line><line>Gumshoe:
"That"...?
</line><line>Debeste:
Yeah, "that"... err. Right! Cut your salary! Looking forward to your next payday!? I've always wanted to say that!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uugh... You're the last person I want cutting my salary, pal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hold it, Debeste. I am only cooperating with the police as a witness to this incident. ...Detective Gumshoe is not to blame.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hmmm. So that's how it is. Well then, should I be raising his salary?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No, that's not what I meant.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But, it would be really nice to get my salary raised.
</line><line>Courtney:
Your mercy is deeply moving, Sebastian. But past transgressions must lead to future judgement. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and all in his company. Depart at once from this holy site.
</line><line>Kay:
B-But that's! We only just got here!
</line><line>Courtney:
The one given the Goddess of Law's blessing for this incident was Sebastian.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In other words, Mr. Debeste is the prosecutor in charge of this case...
</line><line>Debeste:
That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening performance is over! Besides, I've already got my eyes set on the culprit!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat!? Wh-Who, pal?
</line><line>Debeste:
Well, naturally! ...That artist!
</line><line>Larry:
M... Me? Hey! What's going on Edgey!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't ask me. I can't understand his reasoning.
</line><line>Debeste:
Tsk tsk tsk... If you can't understand how the best prosecutor thinks, it simply shows how inculpable you are.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems he doesn't know what "inculpable" even means...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
...That's right, Sebastian. Prosecutor Edgeworth is quite "incapable".
</line><line>Debeste:
Umm. Yes! He's incapable!
</line><line>Kay:
...She just nonchalantly corrected him.
</line><line>Debeste:
Don't underestimate my intelligence gathering skills! I just came from the infirmary and asked the doctor there... ...about the cause of the poison gas!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...And what was the cause?
</line><line>Debeste:
Err. Some "normal" substance... What was its name again? H-Hold on a second. I'll call the doctor to make sure.
</line><line>Courtney:
Since Sebastian is on the phone, I'll answer for him.
</line><line>Kay:
...In that case why didn't you tell us before he called?
</line><line>Courtney:
The poison gas was caused by the mixing of two different types of chemicals. Their names are <textEffects>Normallium</textEffects> and <textEffects>Fatallium</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
So, what are those chemicals exactly?
</line><line>Courtney:
<textEffects>Normallium</textEffects> is a red liquid that's commonly used in everyday products. It can be found in paint and detergent, among other things, but it is not toxic by itself.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So you're saying that it's a substance readily available to anyone.
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. But <textEffects>Fatallium</textEffects>, on the other hand, is not so easy to obtain.
</line><line>Kay:
Its name sure sounds dangerous. What's it used for?
</line><line>Courtney:
It is the active ingredient of a white pesticide known as Megatoxin X. <textEffects>Fatallium</textEffects> itself also has a deep white color, but it's not readily sold in stores. It's nearly impossible to obtain domestically. Right now, we are looking into how this chemical was obtained.
</line><line><textEffects>Poison Gas data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
OK! I've finally found out the names of those chemicals!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney has already told us. We don't need to hear it again.
</line><line>Debeste:
Eh. ...Fine, then. I'll cut to the chase! You know that <textEffects>Normallium</textEffects> from the poison gas is also used in paint, right? Today, out of everyone who visited the art gallery, the only one carrying paint... ...was that artist!
</line><line>Larry:
Y-You're treating me as the culprit just because of that!
</line><line>Debeste:
I object... to the red paint on the palette you're carrying!
</line><line>Larry:
Hey, Edgey... Don't you think this prosecutor is kind of an idiot?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Although I've known him for a short time, his logic is always absurd.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey! Don't ignore me!
</line><line>Courtney:
It's alright, Sebastian. They're only doing it because they're afraid of you. Like the first star to appear at night, show us reasoning that shines the best.
</line><line>Debeste:
The first star shines <textEffects>best</textEffects>... Not bad. Hey, you guys better listen up too!

<center><textEffects>-- Mr. Debeste's Shining Logic --</textEffects></center>
<line>Debeste:
That artist was the "first" to discover the victim, so naturally he's the "best" suspect!
The poison gas was caused by Normallium, a chemical found in paint, right?
As he was carrying paint near the victim, he would've had the "best" chance.
The paint, along with being the first witness! ...That pretty much proves he's the culprit!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
...So! What do you think, Justine?
</line><line>Courtney:
...We cannot ignore the possibility. Well then, Mr. Artist. Please tell us the truth. Did you leave red paint at the crime scene? Or else... Did you cause the poison gas to go off?
</line><line>Larry:
The only thing I leave behind is my "bond of love" with you...
</line><line>Courtney:
...Please watch what you say. My gavel is already prepared to declare you guilty.

Hey, hey, you guys! Ignoring my reasoning just because it's flawless won't do you any good. Mr. Edgeworth, if you've already admitted defeat, you should take your leave!

<line>Edgeworth:
It seems he doesn't pay much attention to what other people are saying. There is a clear contradiction in Mr. Debeste's logic.
</line><line>Kay:
Why'd he even bother making the phone call?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'll finish this quickly. ...This is a waste of time.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. Your logic is more akin to a shooting star than a shining star.
</line><line>Debeste:
He heh. It shines the best like a shooting star, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It may shine brightly for a brief moment, but then it burns itself out. The poison gas originated from inside the glass case of the Pisces Sculpture.
</line><line>Debeste:
Exactly! So that's where the artist set off the gas, right? He used the Normallium in his red paint!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As your senior, let me give you one piece of advice. Listen to the explanations of others. The poison gas was caused by mixing both Normallium and Fatallium together. The Normallium contained in the red paint is not enough by itself.
</line><line>Debeste:
.....Really? But I thought I heard that "Normallium caused the fatality"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Don't tell me you just misheard the forensic report!
</line><line>Debeste:
D-Darn it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By the time Larry discovered the victim, the room was already filled with poison gas. It is time for you to realize how incapable you really are!
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey! What do you mean by "incapable"!?
</line><line>Kay:
You tried to use that word earlier, and you still don't know what it means...
</line><line>Courtney:
He means to say... you are lacking in ability.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Incidetally, "inculpable" has a completely different meaning.
</line><line>Debeste:
.....I get it! You're making fun of me again, aren't you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am merely saying you were incapable in your investigation.
</line><line>Courtney:

</line><line>Courtney:
Before you insult Sebastian, I still have some doubts about your own statement.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What kind of doubts?
</line><line>Courtney:
For all we know, Mr. Artist could have simply entered the Autumn Palace at an earlier time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Moreover, do you have evidence that the red paint is unrelated to the case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...The most important thing now is not the red paint. The <textEffects>red</textEffects> Normallium and the white Fatallium... Exactly how were these two substances mixed? I believe that is our main concern.
</line><line>Courtney:
Naturally. It was Sebastian's job to investigate that. ...Were it not for your interference, we would have found that out by now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I never intended to interfere. On the contrary... I'd like to cooperate.
</line><line>Debeste:
Don't tell me you're going to say you know the cause of the poison gas?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How the poison gas started... I have something that may shed some light on this matter.
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian, do not fall for his bluff.
</line><line>Debeste:
Come now, it's fine really. Let's hear what he's come up with.
</line><line>Courtney:
.......If you say so, Sebastian.
</line><line>Debeste:
Come on, show us! <textEffects>How did the poison gas start?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Debeste:
Surely you're not saying that this was the cause of poison gas?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... It seems even you've noticed it.
</line><line>Debeste:
Duh! It really stands out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Those red tears that Larry saw were undoubtedly Normallium.
</line><line>Debeste:
Huh? Wait a second! If those were chemicals... Does that mean a ghost set off the poison gas?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I don't have time to play along with him.)</textEffects> The red tears of Normallium... could not have triggered the poison gas by itself. That red liquid was mixed inside the case to create the poison gas.
</line><line>Debeste:
What!? Just where do you see evidence that the chemicals were mixed!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That can also be seen in this sketch. Here is the evidence! <textEffects>(Show evidence that the two chemicals were mixed!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
A pink liquid can be seen flowing out from under the case of the Pisces Sculpture. This is proof that the two chemicals were mixed!
</line><line>Debeste:
H-Hold on a second! I still don't get it. How does this show that Normallium and Fatallium were mixed?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Since we have a self-proclaimed artist here, I'll let him explain. Larry. You fancy yourself an artist, so you should know about mixing paint, right? ...What do you add to red to make pink?
</line><line>Larry:
Don't take me for a fool, Edgey! I'll have you know I graduated from middle school! You add white to red to make pink, it's common knowledge! Well, technically there's "rose pink", "baby pink" and several others...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's enough. Now do you understand, Mr. Debeste?
</line><line>Debeste:
Ah! ...That's how it is! By mixing red Normallium with white Fatallium... ...you get a pink liquid!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, exactly. <textEffects>(Took him long enough...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. You have merely presented one possibility... Do we really know if the color was the result of the two chemicals mixed together? Furthermore, this sketch was drawn by the suspect. I cannot put much faith into it.
</line><line>Larry:
I just painted what I saw! How could that be a lie!
</line><line>Courtney:
Mr. Artist. I did not permit you to speak.
</line><line>Larry:
Ugh... So cold... But that's part of her charm!

</line><line>Courtney:
It would not be wise to jeopardize your position even further. Aren't you going to answer my question from before? How do you know that Mr. Artist did not enter the Autumn Palace? If you cannot prove this, there is no room for you to argue any further.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! Couldn't we find that out if we talked to the victim, pal?
</line><line>Courtney:
...The victim, Dane Gustavia, remains unconscious and in critical condition.
</line><line>Gumshoe:

</line><line>Courtney:
...My name is Justine Courtney. Please don't address me by such a strange title.
</line><line>Larry:
Oh, you finally told me your name. Pleased to meet you, Justy! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! But you can call me Laurice!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Mr. Artist. Please get to the point.
</line><line>Larry:
I just remembered something I haven't had a chance to say yet! When I first got to this room, it was locked, so I couldn't go in. But then, that old dude just suddenly fell through the door!
</line><line>Courtney:
...It would appear that the palace rooms can be locked from the inside. But... just because you say it was so, doesn't mean the door was locked. Without proof, your statement holds no value.

</line><line>Ray:
Well, why not let Uncle Ray prove it for you.
</line><line>Courtney:
Wha...!
</line><line>Ray:
After all, we can confirm the room was locked too. Right, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes. I remember as well.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Until the gas outbreak, no one could have entered this room.
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
Perhaps the suspect entered the room with the victim during the gas outbreak?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
As you can see, this man did not inhale any of the gas. If you examine his belongings, you'll find he wasn't carrying a gas mask either.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....Is that so? Well then, I have no choice but to agree.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...? That was easier than I expected.)</textEffects> Anyway... I presume this clears up any suspicion surrounding Larry? ...It seems Mr. Debeste's logic was off once again.
</line><line>Debeste:
Wah hah hah. Not exactly. I just didn't have enough information, that's all. Therefore, my reasoning was just "before its time"!
</line><line>Kay:
He sure has a grand way of saying that things didn't work out for him.
</line><line>Courtney:
In that case, there is one more suspect who has yet to take the stand. ...Mr. Artist, you are free to go.
</line><line>Larry:
Huh! But I wanted to talk to you a little more, Justy.
</line><line>Courtney:
...Overruled.
</line><line>Larry:
Your cold demeanor leaves me mesmerized all the more!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This other suspect is...
</line><line>Courtney:
...a pharmacist by the name of Delicia Scones. It would have been difficult for this artist to obtain the Fatallium from Megatoxin X. ...But a pharmacist may have knowledge of how to do that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Courtney:
The court will now take a 10 minute recess. Sebastian. It would be best if we brought her in quickly.
</line><line>Debeste:
"Best" if we brought her quickly? Heh heh. Sounds good, leave it to me! Hey, Flatfoot! Keep up the investigation!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ugh... Got it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... Judge Courtney suspected her from the very beginning?
</line><line>Kay:
So Mr. Debeste's logic wasn't any help at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Judge Courtney... Just what is she thinking?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Debeste:
Ahem. Sorry to keep you waiting! Prosecutor Debeste presents Ms. Delicia Scones.
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! You called, so here I am! It is I, Delicia Scones, the pharmacist who makes delicious drugs. But you can call me, Ms. Delicious!
</line><line>Debeste:
And you can call me, "Mr. DeBestest."
</line><line>Delicia:
Oi! Nice to meet you, Besty!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(They've gone straight to nicknames...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
Huh? That boy... reminds me of someone.
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory's son.
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! Nice to meet you, Miley.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Could you please not call me "Miley."
</line><line>Delicia:
Ha ha ha! Meeting Greggy's boy... I guess it's a sign that I'm getting old.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How old is this woman...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian. isn't there something you'd like to ask Ms. Pharmacist?
</line><line>Debeste:
Oh. Right, yeah! Ms. Delicious, could you tell us the reason why you came to the gallery?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! I came to see the curator, Katey! I've been friends with her for 17 years, so I visit her quite often.
</line><line>Courtney:
Is it true, Ms. Pharmacist, that you also assisted in the treatment of Mr. Gustavia?
</line><line>Delicia:
I guess you could say that, although I only made the antidote for the doctor.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow! You made the antidote on the spot?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! As long as I have the right ingredients, I can make any drug easily. The infirmary here is well equipped, you see. Instead of sending him to the hospital in critical condition, we treated him right away. I did all I could do. The rest... depends upon his body's ability to recover.
</line><line>Debeste:
Do you know the victim, Ms. Delicious?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie... although it's been 18 years since I last saw him. I only knew that he had become a world-famous pastry chef.
</line><line>Debeste:
Eh! Is the victim that famous?
</line><line>Delicia:
I heard on the news that he had won a competition for designing desserts.
</line><line>Ray:
That reminds me, I do remember him mentioning something about studying design in Zheng Fa.
</line><line>Courtney:
Now, let's get down to business. ...Ms. Pharmacist. Are you familiar with the drug, Megatoxin X?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! It's the drug that's used to kill "those things". It's "mega effective"! Because the effects are so potent, it's not avaliable to the general public.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are "those things" you're referring to?
</line><line>Delicia:
It's a drug for vanquishing the creatures that strike fear into the heart of a lady! ...The ones that often infest kitchens and the like.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah... I think I know what she's talking about.
</line><line>Courtney:
So, Ms. Pharmacist. May I ask you one more thing? Do you know what happens when you mix Normallium with Fatallium?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie... I know. It's even written on the warning label for Megatoxin X: "Hazardous when mixed." When the two drugs are mixed together, a chemical reaction occurs and a gas is released. Inhaling a large amount of this gas can cause breathing difficulties... and even death. From the amount of poison gas Gusty breathed in, I think... ...there was probably at least 500 millilitres of each chemical in the gas.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As expected of a pharmacist, she's very well informed.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
Normallium is an adhesive liquid that becomes hot as soon as heat is applied. It also has a red color and a minty fragrance. Due to its low cost, it's used everywhere! Fatallium is a white, watery liquid.
</line><line>Courtney:
That's enough for now. ...As expected of a pharmacist. You're very knowledgeable.
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! Of course I am. Megatoxin X is one of the chemicals that the company I work for produces!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Delicia:
Ah... But! Not just anyone has access to it! It's so potent as a poison that it couldn't be sold to the public, after all.
</line><line>Courtney:
Thank you... I think that's all I need to hear.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Does Judge Courtney suspect her? What is she hiding behind that smile...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Oh? Flatfoot. Have you made progress in the investigation or something?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... Let me tell you. The glass case that contained the sculptures can be opened by a mechanism in the lid.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hmm. What strange cases.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The temperature in the cases can be lowered down to 0℉. The inside of the Pisces case was set to 27℉, so my hand nearly got stuck to the ice!
</line><line>Debeste:
Good thing it didn't! ...So then?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
From the lid of the Pisces case... ...we detected slight traces of Normallium!
</line><line>Debeste:
Ehh! Not bad!
</line><line>Delicia:
Huh? If the Normallium was in a glass case at a temperature of 27℉, then... ...it would have been frozen to the lid.
</line><line>Debeste:
Ehh. Really? So... What happened?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Debeste. Why don't we try borrowing the power of Kay's Little Thief? I think the circumstances will be easier to understand if we use our "Mr. Thief."
</line><line>Debeste:
Hmph. So you really want to help me out that much? Fine! I'm not really sure how this all works, but... You, get on with it!
</line><line>Kay:
I hate being bossed around by this guy, but to arrive at the truth, I'll do it!

Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud, Courtney-pie! We have approval of the prosecutor in charge, so what's the problem? Could it be, there's something the P.I.C. doesn't want us to find out?
</line><line>Courtney:
......That's none of your concern. If you insist on participating in the investigation... ...then, let me check if you're qualified by asking you a question.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...What is she planning?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Who set off the poison gas? ...If you can answer me that, I'll allow you to work with us.
</line><line>Ray:
...Well then, Miles. The person who opened the Pisces case and set off the gas... When you think about the circumstances, there's only one person it could have been.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... Considering the circumstances, it's clear who it was.
</line><line>Courtney:
So, please give me your answer. <textEffects>Who set off the poison gas?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
There was no one in the Autumn Palace, other than the victim, Dane Gustavia. It's hard to believe it could have been anyone but him.
</line><line>Courtney:
...It seems that way. Very well, I'll allow you to participate this time. However... If I feel you are a hindrance, I will have to ask you to leave.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Understood. <textEffects>(But, what I don't understand is why the victim opened that case...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
So, Mr. Edgeworth. What shall I re-create?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Based on the information we've gathered so far, let's re-create the scene before the gas.
</line><line>Kay:
Got it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
Uwaaaah! D-Don't scare me like that!
</line><line>Courtney:
So, this is the true power of "Sir Thief"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's investigate the Pisces Sculpture posthaste. There's frozen Normallium on the lid of the Pisces Sculpture's glass case.
</line><line>Kay:
It's frozen so thick you can't even open the lid!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
On the actual glass case, the lid was heavily cracked... It was like someone had it out for the Pisces Sculpture, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Do you have any idea how it came to be cracked like this?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hmm... Well, the damage didn't seem to have come from outside of the glass case, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. So the inside of the case was below freezing point, and the case had developed cracks. There are no signs of external damage... From this we can deduce...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Below freezing...? Like Mr. Edgeworth's cold stare...
</line><line>Kay:
And cracked...? Like Mr. Edgeworth's furrowed brow...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thermal fracturing! The cold glass case was heated from the outside, causing it to crack.
</line><line>Ray:
Hmm. But why did thermal fracturing occur here, and what caused it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Inside the thermally fractured glass case, there was frozen Normallium...
</line><line>Ray:
Oh? That face means you've probably thought of something, Miles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed I have. I know how Mr. Gustavia was able to open the glass case.
</line><line>Debeste:
WHAT! How can you possibly know something I don't!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'd say the things he DOES know are in the minority...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey! Aren't you going to LET me know? <textEffects>How did Dane Gustavia open the glass case?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This gas burner, that was found in the Autumn Palace, shows signs of recent use. I believe this was the cause of the thermal fracturing in the Pisces Sculpture's glass case.
</line><line>Debeste:
A gas burner...? Why would he use something like that?
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! I got it! The lid was frozen shut, so he had to use the burner to melt the ice!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, that is correct.
</line><line>Debeste:
Ngh... I just had a late start. I-I'm still "the best", y'know!
</line><line>Kay:
Late start... you didn't even understand a single thing, did you?
</line><line>Debeste:
Well, that's just because Mr. Edgeworth's explanation was too hard to follow!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Kay, why don't you update the Little Thief so that he can understand it.
</line><line>Kay:
If you say so. Right, let's restart the re-creation!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The victim, Dane Gustavia, was the only one to enter the Autumn Palace. If he used the gas burner then... ...the Normallium in the glass case would have melted.
</line><line>Debeste:
...Uh huh, uh huh. And then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The melted Normallium would have come into contact with the Fatallium inside the case... ...and produced the poison gas! The moment Mr. Gustavia opened the lid, he would have begun to inhale the gas. He managed to drag himself out to the Fountain Patio just before his strength ran out.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Debeste:
...So he inhaled the gas when he opened the lid...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems he finally understands.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
But why did Mr. Gustavia open the glass case of the Pisces Sculpture?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim's goal... That, I do not yet know.
</line><line>Ray:
Perhaps he had the same reason as Uncle Ray. Maybe he actually came to see the Winter Palace, not the Autumn one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
Uncle Ray also thought that this was the Winter Palace at first.
</line><line>Delicia:
Oi! You too, Ray Ray? Actually, I thought so too! It looks just like Icy's room from 18 years ago. It's even got the exact same plants in front of the door.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems everyone involved with the IS-7 Incident made the same mistake. It is imperative that we investigate the real Winter Palace immediately. I should suggest that to Mr. Debeste.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
I get it now...! Yeah. That's how it was!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Huh... Did you think of something?
</line><line>Debeste:
The victim committed suicide! He thought he would look refined if he died in an art gallery!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....
</line><line>Kay:
...Have you even been listening?
</line><line>Debeste:
Well, if you're as smart as me, just hearing half of the story will be enough.
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian. I'll explain it from the top later.
</line><line>Debeste:
"Top"...! That means "best", right? Alright, I'll leave it to you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Yes, it would indeed be "best" to let Judge Courtney handle him.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
That aside, don't you have some information to inform everyone of?
</line><line>Debeste:
Aah! I totally forgot!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What are you talking about?
</line><line>Debeste:
He heh. We did a little checking on that pharmacist. "We" meaning me, "The Best" Prosecutor's... subordinate!
</line><line>Kay:
That's not something to brag about.
</line><line>Debeste:
S-Shut up, you! Quiet down and listen! Suicide is... um... Off the table for now, yeah. That's because, umm... in short... That pharmacist is the culprit! She set up the gas as a trap!
</line><line>Delicia:
Eeep! N-No!
</line><line>Courtney:
It's a terrible shame, ...Ms. Pharmacist. How could one in the profession of saving lives stoop to extinguishing them!
</line><line>Delicia:
Huh? Wh-What are you saying? I... I would never do such a thing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. Do you have a basis for these accusations?
</line><line>Debeste:
Hmph! Of course! This is my basis! Her pharmacist's license. It would permit her to handle Megatoxin X, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....And its active ingredient Fatallium was one of the components of the poison gas.
</line><line>Debeste:
Exactly! That chemical is almost impossible for ordinary people to obtain! But, that pharmacist is another story altogether!
</line><line>Delicia:
I-It wasn't me! You've got it all wrong!
</line><line>Debeste:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Debeste:
And that's not all! A bottle of Megatoxin X was found in the victim's pocket. And on the bottle... we found clear fingerprints, yours!
</line><line>Delicia:
E... EEEEEEEEEEP!
</line><line>Debeste:
You and the curator took the victim to the infirmary, right? That would have given you the perfect opportunity to plant the bottle on him!
</line><line>Delicia:
Th-That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
You are the only pharmacist on the premises who could have handled Megatoxin X. Furthermore, as for the curator of this art gallery, you're an acquaintance of hers. You would've had access to the gallery at any time, in order to prepare the poison gas trap.
</line><line>Delicia:
P-Please wait! That Megatoxin X, it was stolen!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Trying to lie your way out of this won't go well with me.
</line><line>Delicia:
It's true! Look, I've got the proof right here in my bag...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...What is she searching for?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
Not this... Not this either...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Hm? I remember seeing cloth like that recently...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Delicia:
Ah! Here! Please take a look at this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? It's some sort of paper...?
</line><line>Delicia:
What's it say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"April 1st Theft Report Accepted. Stolen Item: Megatoxin X" This... is a theft report acceptance certificate.
</line><line>Debeste:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! Truth is... one week ago, my Megatoxin X was stolen.
</line><line>Courtney:
One week ago...? That means, you didn't have it with you today?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie... That bottle you just found is probably the one that was stolen from me. I normally carry that bottle of Megatoxin X in my bag at all times. Even though I often forget to keep it locked up... I would never even think about mixing it with Normallium!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But... Why in the world would you carry such a dangerous substance on your person?
</line><line>Delicia:
Well, you never know when those things will appear. Those... those...
</line><line>Kay:
..."Those creatures that infest the kitchen, striking fear into the heart of a lady," right? Although if you had a rolled-up newspaper, you could just squash them with one blow.
</line><line>Debeste:
...Justine, what do we do now?
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then... Can we really accept this theft report? Let's ask for confirmation. That should clearly tell us whether or not she's lying.
</line><line>Debeste:
Right! Well then, I'll just call and confirm it.
</line><line>Kay:
It looks like Ms. Delicious isn't the culprit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. If she really did set up the poison gas as a trap... I don't believe she would do it in the way that incriminates her the most.
</line><line>Ray:
...So Miles, who do you think is the culprit?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Predicting the actions of the victim would require a fair amount of advance planning... And there's only one person here capable of that.
</line><line>Ray:
Huh? Uncle Ray would like to know too. ...Who do you suspect?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>The one who stole the Megatoxin X and prepared the room in advance was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It had to be the curator of the Zodiac Art Gallery... Ms. Katherine Hall. However, I still don't have any evidence that she is the criminal yet...
</line><line>Ray:
I see... She is... .....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...? The way he said that just now sounded like he had been expecting it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Hmm. Good job Miles! As expected from Uncle Ray's future apprentice!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I have no intention of becoming your apprentice.
</line><line>Debeste:
Aaaand I will now announce the results of my verification! I can confirm that her theft report was indeed accepted! Therefore... it's a little too early to come to a decision!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... that means your logic was completely faulty.
</line><line>Debeste:
Ngh... Y-You're wrong! My real performance is still to come!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Really...? And how do you plan to proceed with your investigation?
</line><line>Debeste:
Th-That's... First, we need to speak with the curator.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And after that?
</line><line>Debeste:
Ugh... W-We'll cross that bridge when we come to it!
</line><line>Courtney:
Sebastian. Mr. Gustavia may have had business in the Winter Palace. I believe we should send an investigator there as well.
</line><line>Debeste:
Oh! That's good too! Detective Gumshoe! Investigate the Winter Palace at once!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uugh... Got it, sir.
</line><line>Debeste:
Justine! Let's go talk to the curator!
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes, let us proceed.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...We should go and listen to what Ms. Hall has to say as well.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 2, 1:35 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio</textEffects></center>
<line>Debeste:
Alright, I want you guys to listen to what the curator has to say.
</line><line>Kay:
...Mr. Debeste, weren't you going to go and talk to her yourself?
</line><line>Debeste:
Nah. That's a job for my subordinates. All I have to do is wait for their report. ...I'm "The Best" Prosecutor, after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Such arrogance...!
</line><line>Kay:
Well, this is anticlimactic. I'm gonna chill for a bit. Huh? What's that in the fountain...! A-AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
</line><line>Debeste:
WAAAAAAAHH! Th-There's a dead body in the fountaaain!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What... is the meaning of this...!?
</line><line>Ray:
.....!
</line><line>Courtney:
Silence, everyone! Forensics! Identify this body at once...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-It's terrible, paaaal!
</line><line>Courtney:
Please be quiet, Detective!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The ice sculptures in the W-Winter Palace... They've all melted, paaaaal!
</line><line>Ray:
Wha?
</line><line>Kay:
Wha?
</line><line>Debeste:
Wha?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
What's going on here!?
</line><line>Kay:
There are two victims now...
</line><line>Ray:
This is all... just like 18 years ago. Once again, the ice sculptures have melted.
</line><line>Kay:
Again...?
</line><line>Ray:
...And everyone related to the incident 18 years ago is gathered here now. This is no mere coincidence. Don't you think so, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. The key to finding the truth of this case lies in this IS-7 Incident. ...This is what I believe.
</line><line>Ray:
He he heh. That's right. Uncle Ray thinks so too. Looks like it's time once again for Uncle Ray to tell you about the IS-7 Incident.
