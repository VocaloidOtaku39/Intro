            <h2>My Reflective Essay</h2>
            
            <p>As a new learner, the most significant challenges on GitHub Pages are programming codes for aligning the images, as well as the text layout for the site, such as position and text boxes. On Wordpress, on the other hand, the most significant challenge for me is to decide on a theme to make this website stand out rather than making it look bland. </p>
            
            <p>On both websites, I do find some advantages that make designing the webpages somewhat easier. On GitHub Pages, one advantage is that sometimes, I wrap text around it as if I were writing codes in XML. Certainly, in Wordpress, it is easier to align images and other kinds of text, such as captions. Updating the contents of the webpage is a lot easier, especially if one were to make even the smallest change to their webpage.</p>
            
           <p> However, I do have challenges with using both websites. I find it harder for me to design a webpage via GitHub pages than Wordpress because programming each aspect of the website and Git pushing the contents feel like a chore. In Wordpress, one challenge is to utilize some programming to form headings in text, as well as the alignment of images in the webpage as well.</p>
            
            <p>It is necessary to learn the concepts of coding to create a webpage, such as XML and GitHub, and I would like to make pages a little more organized and professional-looking, such as a nav bar on the side of the screen rather than on top of the screen, as well as a selection in the gallery where one can scroll across images and click on the image to view them up close.</p>
