Athena:
Oh, no! I'm gonna be late! *huff* *puff* Whew, finally. So, this is it... the illustrious <textEffects>Themis Legal Academy</textEffects>. <textEffects>(This is the place where many distinguished lawyers and prosecutors got their start. When news spread that Mr. Wright had gotten his attorney's badge back... ...he received a call from this school, asking him to pay a visit. Mr. Wright brought us along, hoping we'd learn something from the experience. But no, I had to go and blow it by getting here thirty minutes late. At least it's not all business today! After all, today's their <span style="color:#E16935">school festival</textEffects>!)</span>

Athena:
<textEffects>(Wow! This place has school festival written all over it... literally! But why all the cold stares? Is it because everyone's in a school uniform except me? Well, I like the way I dress! Wonder where Mr. Wright and Apollo are?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>Your attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall. Thank you.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Athena:
<textEffects>(Sounds like a mock trial is about to start, but where's this Lecture Hall? Looks like all the students and faculty are heading that way. Might as well join them. Maybe I'll find Mr. Wright and Apollo there!)</textEffects>

Athena:
<textEffects>(This must be the Lecture Hall. Wow, they spent some serious money on this place. The District Court can't even compete.)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>Hey, Athena! Over here!</center>
<line>
Athena:
Ah, Mr. Wright! Apollo! I've been looking for you two. I'm so sorry I'm late.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's okay. Sorry we couldn't wait for you. But we didn't want to be late for our meeting.
</line><line>Apollo:
Lucky for you, the person we're supposed to meet also seems to be running late.
</line><line>???:
Mr. Wright, Mr. Justice, it seems Prof. Courte has yet to arrive. How un-professorial of her to keep visitors to our esteemed institution waiting like this! I shall make her write "I will not--" ...Oh, who do we have here?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right. You haven't been introduced yet.
</line><line>???:
Ah, yes. You must be the young lady Mr. Wright was telling me about. I am Aristotle Means, a professor at this hallowed hall of teaching. I oversee the lawyer course here. It is a pleasure to meet you.
</line><line>Athena:
I'm Athena Cykes! I just recently got my attorney's badge myself! It's nice to meet you, too!
</line><line>Means:
How wonderful! So vigorous and vivacious. You just earned yourself a gold star.
</line><line>Athena:
Wow, thanks! <textEffects>(That big smile of his is kinda scary, though.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Looks like the <textEffects>mock trial's</textEffects> about to begin. What are we going to do about our meeting?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, speaking of the mock trial, do either of you know what it's about?
</line><line>Means:
Oh, but I thought we had sent a pamphlet to your office.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right, the pamphlet... Whatever happened to that?
</line><line>Athena:
You won't be seeing it again. Trucy used it for the old rip-it-up-and-restore-it trick. ...Unfortunately, it didn't work as advertised.
</line><line>Means:
Well, it seems I had better explain the situation, then.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Professor.

...Prof. Means, forgive me for interrupting you and your guests. I'm Juniper Woods, a third year in the judge course. Professor, the trial will begin shortly. Since you'll be delivering the pre-trial speech... ...would you mind waiting up in the balcony until we're ready for you?
</line><line>Means:
My, how very organized you are, Juniper. You just earned yourself a gold star, too. But what about Prof. Courte... Well, I suppose she'll eventually arrive. Now then, I trust you will look after our visitors, Juniper?
</line><line>Woods:
Yes, of course, Prof. Means.
</line><line>Athena:
Juniper? Juniper Woods? Is that you?
</line><line>Woods:
Hm? ...Then-- Athena?! I almost didn't recognize you. I didn't know you were back from Europe.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, you two know each other? Now that's a coincidence.
</line><line>Athena:
We've known each other since we were kids. We're like best friends, right, Junie?!
</line><line>Woods:
Yes... Well, we lived close to each other, so we used to play in the forest together.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, like a lot a lot. <textEffects>(Why won't she look at me? I guess I shouldn't be surprised since we haven't seen each other in a long time.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Anyway... we're supposed to go wait in the waiting room, right? Not that I wouldn't mind taking in the mock trial you're putting on today.
</line><line>Woods:
Unfortunately, the mock trial is only for students and faculty. There is one seat reserved for Mr. Wright, but no other exceptions are allowed.
</line><line>Means:
Yes, I'm very sorry, but it is part of the student curriculum, after all. I hope you won't mind remaining in the waiting room until the trial concludes.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping to learn something new today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I'll tell you what, Apollo. Why don't you take my place?
</line><line>Apollo:
What? Really?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure. Besides, I'd like to meet with Prof. Courte as soon as she gets here.
</line><line>Athena:
Aw, no fair! I wanna see the mock trial, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, I'm going to let Apollo pull what little rank he has. ....If it's okay with Prof. Means.
</line><line>Means:
But of course, Mr. Wright, if that is what you wish.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's settled, then. We'll expect a full and detailed report, Apollo, so pay attention!
</line><line>Athena:
Tsk, being the new kid sure stinks.
</line><line>Woods:
If you would please follow me. I'll escort you down to the waiting room on the first floor.

Athena:
<textEffects>(Still no Prof. Courte... It's been over thirty minutes. And Mr. Wright's snoozing away on the sofa. This is so boring. I should've hid in the Lecture Hall and spied on the mock trial.)</textEffects>

Phoenix:
*yawn* ...Athena. I could've sworn I just heard something fall down and break. If you go running now, they'll think it was you.
</line><line>Athena:
W-Well it wasn't me. I think it came from somewhere outside.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh. Well, we better go have a look, seeing as everyone else is in the Lecture Hall.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay!

Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage</textEffects></center>
<line>
Athena:
Is this stage for some sort of concert? It kinda reminds me of a courtroom.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, Athena. Behind the witness stand!
</line><line>Athena:
What? Eeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Prof. Courte! Can you hear me?! Professor!
</line><line>Athena:
Wait, that's... that's who we were supposed to be meeting with?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
......... It looks like our meeting's been canceled for us.
</line><line>Athena:
No way! This... This can't be real...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
I called the police. They should be here soon. ...I'll go tell everyone in the Lecture Hall, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, wait. They'll find out soon enough once the police get here. Let's do our own crime scene investigation before it gets too crowded around here.
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?! Are we even allowed to do that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's no big deal, as long as we leave it exactly like we found it. Plus... No, never mind. Anyway, we should look around while the scene's still fresh.
</line><line>Athena:
But...... Okay, you're the boss.

<line><i>After examining arrow and planner:</i>
</line><line>Athena:
I think that's about all we're going to find out from the body for now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nice work, Athena. Your face only turned five shades of pale. I was expecting fifty. We should probably take a picture of the crime scene, just in case.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, I'm on it! Say cheese!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Cheese? And I thought I was the one with the twisted sense of humor.
</line><line>Athena:
I think that should do it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, let's take a better look around the area while we wait for the police to arrive.
</line><line>Athena:
This pile of rubble sticks out like a sore thumb. Looks like broken pottery or plaster. Maybe this is the source of that noise we heard.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm, there were supposedly two statues on this stage. I seem to recall hearing that a coed from the Fine Art Club had made them.
</line><line>Athena:
There were two? Then that thing over there is the remains of another statue?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This could be related to the case. Let's take a closer look.

</line><line>???:
Mr. Wright! Athena!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, here comes Apollo! I've never seen anyone move so fast!
</line><line>Apollo:
*huff*... *huff*... Listen! Something big's happened! I was at the mock trial when the police announced a body had been found on campus!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. And we're the ones who phoned it in. We found Prof. Courte dead behind the witness stand over there.
</line><line>Apollo:
WH-WHAAAT?! Can you show me?! ...What the--?!
</line><line>Athena:
We've already had a quick look at the body. It's definitely a homicide. Once the police get here--
</line><line>Apollo:
No, I know it's a homicide! I'm shocked because it's the same! Exactly the same!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoa there, Apollo. Take a deep breath and explain what you mean.
</line><line>Apollo:
It's the same! The body, that is! It's just like it was in the <textEffects>mock trial</textEffects>!
</line><line>Athena:
What? It's like the mock trial?
</line><line>Apollo:
I know! It sounds crazy, b-but... The body's location and position, the murder weapon, the lack of pooling blood... It's all exactly like the mock trial!
</line><line>Athena:
You're kidding, right? It can't really all be the same... can it...?

Phoenix:
The whole school's in an uproar. There won't be any more classes today.
</line><line>Apollo:
A murder on campus... That's the last thing I expected at a legal academy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'll go tell Prof. Means what we observed when we discovered the body. You two wait here until you've spoken with the police.
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, Boss!
</line><line>Apollo:
*sigh* I can't believe this is happening.
</line><line>Athena:
I can't believe we have to wait around here. I can't stay still at times like these. <textEffects>(I hope Junie hasn't fainted from the shock of this whole thing.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
Ah! Thena... er, I mean, Athena. There you are.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie! Am I glad to see you! I was worried that--
</line><line>Woods:
Don't worry about me. I am Student Council President, after all. I need to be strong.
</line><line>Athena:
Student Council President? Wow, I'm impressed. <textEffects>(She's really changed. She used to be kind of sickly and shy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Juniper was it? You mind if we ask you a few questions?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, we're stuck here waiting for the police. And there's really not much to do.
</line><line>Woods:
Sure, what would you like to know?

<line>Apollo:
Hey, isn't that--!
</line><line>???:
Everyone, stay right where you are! Don't move a muscle!
</line><line>Athena:
D-Detective Fulbright? Is something wrong?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Why, if it isn't my little lawyer friends! Sorry, but the small talk will have to wait. Juniper Woods, you're under arrest <textEffects>for the murder of Constance Courte</textEffects>!
</line><line>Woods:
...I'm what?
</line><line>Athena:
W-Wait a second! What's going on here?! Why are you arresting Junie?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Please, Detective Fulbright. We're involved in this case, too.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ah-ha! So, you're the lawyers the dispatch said were first on scene! I can't tell you everything, but I will say this. There are two major reasons for her arrest. Number one! The suspect led someone to where the body was.
</line><line>Woods:
I-I didn't--!
</line><line>Fulbright:
And number two! The crime scene is exactly how the suspect portrayed it in her script!
</line><line>Athena:
But...! You can't arrest her on just those grounds!
</line><line>Fulbright:
True. But there's more! However, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me to say no more than that!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(So Blackquill's the prosecuting attorney on this one, too...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Policeman:
Detective Fulbright! We found this in the suspect's pocket!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Hm? Wh-Why there's...! There's blood on this!
</line><line>Woods:
Th-That's evidence we made for the mock trial!
</line><line>Fulbright:
A mock... trial? Never heard of such a thing, but it sounds fishy to me! Real fishy! Now, if you would, officers.
</line><line>Policeman:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Woods:
B-But... *cough, cough* I... *cough*
</line><line>Athena:
Junie! <textEffects>(I have to do something! I... I can't let them take her away like this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

Th-Thena...
</line><line>Athena:
Junie... It's good to hear you say that name again.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Fulbright:
Hate to interrupt your bonding time, but... Aren't you rather new to all this? You're barely even a lawyer!
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I don't have much experience, and I may need Apollo and Mr. Wright's help at times... ...but nobody believes in Junie as much as I do!
</line><line>Apollo:
I'll help you, too, Juniper. There's no way you murdered your professor.
</line><line>Woods:
Thena... *cough* Apollo... Thank *cough* you both. I'm counting on you! *cough, cough*
</line><line>Athena:
We've got your back, Junie!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Guess things worked out after all. Now that you have your lawyers, Ms. Woods, it's time for us to head back to the station.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I can't believe Junie's been arrested for murder. And I can't believe I accepted her case without asking Mr. Wright!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Take a deep breath and relax, Athena. I'm here to help with whatever you need, so let's get right on the case!
</line><line>Athena:
Right!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. I won't have this case left in the hands of rank amateurs. If anyone's going to solve this case, it'll be me. Time to investigate.
</line><line>Athena:
Why that smug little--! <textEffects>(He hasn't even finished law school!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
HUUUUUUGH!!! That was totally ruuude!!! And you're not the only one on the case, maaaaaan!!! I'm in, too! Big time! JUUUUUUUUUNIPER WOOOOOOODS!!! I'm gonna save yooooooooou!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
Now that those two are gone, let's get back to what I was talking about in front of the stage. ...About the <textEffects>mock trial</textEffects>, that is.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, right! You said the victim's location, position, and so on were <textEffects>just like in the script</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. But without the script or any props, it's kind of hard to explain.
</line><line>???:
Perhaps I could help... Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
P-Prosecutor Gavin! What are you doing here?
</line><line>Athena:
You two seem to know each other. Is someone going to introduce me?
</line><line>Klavier:
Why, I do believe we have a fresh face here. Greetings, Fräulein. I am Klavier Gavin. Some know me as a prosecutor, but I'm most famous for my former rock band. We were quite popular you know, but regrettably, the band went kaput. Perhaps you've heard of us? The <textEffects>Gavinners</textEffects>? I was the lead vocalist.
</line><line>Athena:
Never heard of your band. Then again, I was out of the country till only recently. But... can I get your autograph?!
</line><line>Apollo:
You just met him like three seconds ago and you want his autograph?
</line><line>Klavier:
Forgive me Fräulein, but I've retired from the music biz. But I'd be happy to offer my autograph as rock star prosecutor, Klavier Gavin.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, okay. That one, then!
</line><line>Klavier:
She's a lively one, eh, Herr Forehead? Didn't know she was your type.
</line><line>Apollo:
.........She's the newest member of Wright Anything Agency, that's all.
</line><line>Athena:
Nice to meet you! I'm Athena Cykes!
</line><line>Klavier:
A pleasure to meet you too, Athena Cykes. Now that the intros are out of the way... ...I'm sure you have some questions for me, ja, Herr Forehead?

Klavier:
Right. the stage is ready. And you, Herr Forehead? Ready to rock?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, no, the defense is not ready to rock.
</line><line>Klavier:
You saw the actual mock trial earlier, right? Just relax, you'll do fine. Besides, we have the script right here.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie's masterpiece?! The one everyone's been talking about?!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ja, and there's only one in existence. I "borrowed" it, if you will. Now, Fräulein, we'll need you to play the part of defendant and judge as per the script.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, got it!
</line><line>Klavier:
I've only read the case outline so far. I don't know how it actually turns out, so I'll treat this like I'm prosecuting a real case. You, Herr Forehead, will play the part of a fledgling lawyer, a role you were born to play. All the evidence is also here with us. We have everything we need to reprise the mock trial.
</line><line>Athena:
Très bien! Let's get started. Defendant-slash-judge Athena Cykes, is psyched and ready to rock! Court is now in session for our reenactment of the mock trial... ...or what I'd like to call the <textEffects>mock mock trial</textEffects>!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ja, a double mockery, perhaps, but a trial is still a trial. Achtung, baby! It's no holds barred! Let's rock!

Aw, can't we take it easy today?

It may just be a mock of a mock, but there's only one way to compete! You play to win! So remember, each time I catch you slacking off, I'm holding you in contempt of court!

Great... A judge that voices her own objections AND abuses her judicial powers.

<line><i>After clearing all Talk options:</i>
</line><line>Klavier:
Quite the crafty killer. In an attempt to case suspicion on the Archery Club... ...they moved the body to the quad where it would be an easy shot from the clubroom. Then the killer faked the murder weapon by inserting an arrow into the awl's stab wound.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Sounds like he has only high praise for Junie's script.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Were there any further arguments from the defense?
</line><line>Apollo:
Nope. It seemed like the teacher who was playing the judge was satisfied, too.
</line><line>Klavier:
Time for the finale, then. Your verdict if you please, Fräulein Judge!
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? Oh, right, that's me! Very well, this court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods-- Wait a second. Even if this is just a mock trial of a mock trial... ...I don't want to declare Junie guilty!
</line><line>Klavier:
Yeah, perhaps that's not such a good idea. Let's end our mock mock trial here. Besides, it's about time I get back to my investigation.
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks, you two! That little run-through of the mock trial cleared up quite a few things!
</line><line><textEffects>Mock Trial Script added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Achtung, baby! The prosecution's already got a witness sized up, too.
</line><line>Athena:
That was quick. <textEffects>(Prosecutor Blackquill's almost too good...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
You're in such a helpful mood today, Prosecutor Gavin...
</line><line>Klavier:
Well, like I said, I just want to catch whoever killed Prof. Courte. And there's no reason for me to start butting heads with you two. Anyway, I won't say goodbye, as I'm sure I'll be seeing you later.
</line><line>Athena:
I always thought prosecutors were all a rather scary bunch. But Prosecutor Gavin seems pretty nice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, he's not so bad as prosecutors go. We should get back to investigating, too. We don't have nearly enough information yet.
</line><line>Athena:
And we also have to tell Mr. Wright that we accepted Junie's case.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. Looks like we have our work cut out for us!

Athena:
Ah, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I heard they arrested your friend Juniper.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, Detective Fulbright just took her in.
</line><line>Means:
I refuse to believe that one of our students is capable of murder. We must prove her innocent by any means necessary! The end justifies the means!
</line><line>Athena:
What do you mean, the end justifies the means?
</line><line>Means:
I, Prof. Means, always say what I mean, and mean what I say by all means! Here at our esteemed academy, <textEffects>we train our students to produce meaningful results</textEffects>. You believe in Juniper's innocence, do you not?
</line><line>Athena:
Of course, I do! Junie wouldn't even hurt a fly!
</line><line>Means:
Precisely. We have <textEffects>justice</textEffects> on our side. The only other thing we need are <textEffects>results</textEffects>. It is the height of folly to endanger your client by failing to pursue all means possible!
</line><line>Athena:
Um... sure I want to prove her innocence, but... <textEffects>(I don't like the sound of that "end justifies the means" part.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Well, you are still young and idealistic. It's no wonder you fail to see the wisdom therein. There is but one thing to do now. I must personally take up Juniper's defense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're going to take her case, Prof. Means?
</line><line>Means:
I may be a professor, but I am still licensed to practice law. In fact, I have even battle Prof. Courte in... well... in court!
</line><line>Apollo:
No kidding?! So you guys were rivals or something?
</line><line>Means:
No, nothing of the sort. She was an esteemed colleague at the academy and in court. You see, both Prof. Courte and I graduated from this academy at the top of our class.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Wow, I bet they both used to really bring it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Now, if you would excuse me, I had best go discuss the case with Juniper.
</line><line>Athena:
Prof. Means, please, wait! I didn't want to say anything, but Apollo and I already agreed to take her case.
</line><line>Apollo:
It's true. Juniper is counting on us to prove her innocence.
</line><line>Means:
Really now? You two?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And when were you planning on telling me?
</line><line>Athena:
S-Sorry, Boss. I know we should've asked first, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. Relax. Your friend was just hauled away in front of your eyes. Sometimes you just have to make snap decisions. And I think you made the right one.
</line><line>Means:
How wonderful! Very well, Athena Cykes, let me ask you just one thing. As a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?
</line><line>Athena:
Heh heh! That's any <i>[sic]</i> easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!
</line><line>Means:
What a wonderful answer. Juniper must be overjoyed to have a friend such as you. As her professor, I too, shall do whatever I may to help her. And if you decide to take <textEffects>the-end-justifies-the-means strategy, come see me at once</textEffects>!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Let's hope it never comes to that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Now, if you would excuse me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, time's a wasting. You better start investigating and fast. But first, how about I tell you everything I know so far?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, please!
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
I think that about wraps up what I know so far. The fact that this case closely resembles Ms. Woods's script is obviously important. Knowing that, you should probably try and identify what's the same and what's different.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay! I'll try talking to as many people as I can on campus!

Athena:
Look, there's Hugh! Hey, Huuuuugh!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Oh, it's you two. Do you want something?
</line><line>Apollo:
Did you find anything? You said you were going to do some investigating of your own.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Nope, nothing yet. I'm afraid it's not looking very good for Juniper.
</line><line>Apollo:
You don't really think Juniper could have done something like this, do you?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Only the author and the victim knew the contents of the script. Both the stage and the art room were in the exact same state as described therein. Nobody could mimic the crime like that unless they'd already read the script... or... wrote it.
</line><line>Athena:
B-But!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Look, Prof. Means is better able to handle this than you two, so just leave it to him!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(There it is again. I'm picking up some discord in Hugh's voice.)</textEffects>

Thanks for sharing that important piece of information with us. It may prove useful at tomorrow's trial.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Good. Because that's all I have to say about the matter.
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks. And don't worry, we'll prove Juniper's innocence, you'll see.

Heh, I can't say you two inspire much confidence.

Athena:
So this is the maintenance area. Let's see... During the mock mock trial, Prosecutor Gavin said... ...that the art room is right above here on the third floor... ...and that they body was dropped from there onto a high jump mat from the storehouse.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. And then he claimed that the body was transported to the stage in a ball cart. And then... Hm? There's someone else here...
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, it's Robin!
</line><line>Newman:
Whoooooooooa! You scared the crud outta meeeeee!!!
</line><line>Athena:
Yikes! Right back at you! ...So, what are you doing out here?
</line><line>Newman:
I'm working out so that I can become strong enough to save Juniper! But I'm so worked up... my training brace is almost breaking at the seams!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, right... The girl you like got arrested, so you're psyching yourself up to rescue her?
</line><line>Newman:
Yes! Because! I'm the manliest of manly men! ...That's why I work out with my manly brace!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Except that I hear some discord in that manliest of men's voice of yours...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't mean to be rude, but can't you talk without shouting?
</line><line>Newman:
Sorry! I'll try not to shout so much! If at all possible, that is!!!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(...Which is "not at all possible" by the sound of it.)</textEffects> Um, so do you mind if I ask you some questions as Junie's lawyer?
</line><line>Newman:
No problem! Ask away! Keep 'em coming, maaaaaan!!!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Ouch... My ears ache already.)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
I thought the area was cordoned off. Hey, the police are discussing something over there.
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh, I know! I'll just quietly sneak over for a listen. Here goes...
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah! Athena, watch where you're--!
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? Eeeeeeeeek! Ouch! Who put this stupid box here? Wait............ Eek! A-A-Apollo! This box, there's...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What now?
</line><line>Athena:
Th-Th-There's! There's someone or... *gulp* something inside!
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't let it be a SNAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
</line><line>???:
............Sss, sss, sss. You morons just blew my cover.
</line><line>Apollo:
What the--? There really is someone inside...
</line><line>???:
Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! That someone is me, Myriam Scuttlebutt. And I'm a senior in the judge course.
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What's with the box?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. It's the fate of we who live in the shadows. There's a very good reason why none may see my face by the light of day!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, if you're taking the judge course, did you write a mock trial script, too?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. You really want to see my script that bad? Well, you better watch out. Read it without my permission and you'll wish you hadn't!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Who cares? I'm sure it was rejected for a good reason.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
That's strange. You suddenly tightened your grip when you said, "for Juniper's sake." It's like you subconsciously tensed up because you're lying.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk! Wh-What're you talking about?! When did I ever lie?!
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, then let me ask you this... Why were you selected as a witness?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. That's an easy one. I'm the editor-in-chief of the Themis Herald. I know everything there is to know around campus, even the darkest of secrets.
</line><line>Apollo:
Editor-in-chief, huh? Pretty impressive.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, yeah well, it's a lonely, one-woman operation. I do it all myself, from reporting, to editing, to publishing. Still impressed? I'm a perfect storm of journalism because I bring it all to the table, sss, sss, sss, sss! ...And this is the evidence. Here! An extra edition of the Themis Herald, published to coincide with the mock trial!
</line><line><textEffects>Themis Herald Extra added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks, Myriam. You've revealed who you truly are: As someone who's never had Junie's best interest in mind.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
What?! Are you questioning our friendship?!
</line><line>Athena:
Look, you may want answers, but... No can do, because what you're saying conflicts with this piece of evidence.
</line>


<line>Scuttlebutt:
That's the Themis Herald, the paper I publish. What about it?
</line><line>Athena:
...Are you really that dense? This article is full of malicious lies about Junie! It's definitely not something a true friend of hers would write!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk! Y-You got it all wrong! Another staff member wrote that one!
</line><line>Athena:
I don't think so, Myriam. You even said it yourself just a moment ago. "It's a one-woman operation." Or did you forget already?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk! If you'd just give me the info you have--! Stupid pawn! Juniper's just using you!

Ugh. We're going to have cross-examine <i>[sic]</i> her tomorrow, but I don't know where to start.

You're right. Let's see what else we can find out!

</line><line>Woods:
It looks like we're about out of time. Thank you for coming to see me.
</line><line>Athena:
We'll do everything we can to prove you innocent tomorrow.
</line><line>Woods:
I know. And I believe in you, Thena. Well, I should go now. Bye.
</line><line>Apollo:
Is she gonna be all right? She's like a shadow of the girl we met back at the academy.
</line><line>Athena:
The Junie I knew was always like that -- a little weak and sickly. But the fact that she's lifted her façade shows that she trusts us. Even still...
</line><line>Apollo:
What is it?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, when Junie and her two friends were talking about their friendship... ...I sensed some discord in their hearts.
</line><line>Apollo:
Seriously?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, but it was really faint. I might've been mistaken. <textEffects>(There's no reason to doubt their friendship... is there?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't worry, everything will be fine! You and Juniper are friends, right? You know that friend I mentioned to you earlier? Well, get this. Whenever something's troubling one of us, the other can just feel it. That's real friendship.
</line><line>Athena:
I suppose you're right... Might as well forget about that and concentrate on the trial!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yup! Tomorrow's the big day. Let's sort out what we know so far.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay! The victim Constance Courte was murdered in the art room on the third floor. Then, her body was moved to the outdoor stage in the quad. Also, the location where we found the body was just as the mock trial script described.
</line><line>Apollo:
I wish those were the only similarities they shared.
</line><line>Athena:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Apollo:
What I mean is the script and this case are exactly the same in almost every respect. So it follows that the actual trial may very well unfold just like the mock trial did!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, no! <textEffects>(The mock trial ended right before the prosecution was about to win! Well, that's not gonna happen! This time, Junie WILL be declared "not guilty"! Of course, I intend to get our results the honest way. We can do this! We'll be fine! After all, I have Apollo and he's the king of being fine.)</textEffects>
