Layton:
Did you say, "<textEffects>suspicious characters</textEffects>"?
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>W. Shopping Area</i>
</line><line>Muffet:
That's wight! Suspicious chawacters! I saw them, I did! In Nulwitch Woods... A pair of <textEffects>mystewious men</textEffects>!
</line><line>Petter:
Yea, I saw them too. No matter how you look at it, they were a couple of <textEffects>weirdos</textEffects>, all right.
</line><line>Tuggit:
Mmm...! Ngaaaa...! Ngaaaa...! They're <textEffects>desperados</textEffects>, I tell you! Yes, that's what they are, <textEffects>desperados</textEffects>!
</line><line>Allan:
They're an <textEffects>embarrassment</textEffects>, is what they are. And right on the day of the fire festival, too!
</line><line>Cecil:
O-okay! I'll take them on! I'm not afraid.
</line><line>Petal:
Whaddya mean, you'll take 'em on? You're nothin' but a crybaby.
</line><line>Cutter:
Gyah ha ha!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is all this...? Seems like everyone and his brother has <i>[sic]</i> come here to make complaints at us!
</line><line>Espella:
Perhaps it's just that they all want to see you again...and think you can help.
</line><line>Layton:
Whatever the reason, we can't very well ignore the fact that there seem to be a pair of <textEffects>villains</textEffects> on the loose...
</line><line>Maya:
Oh! I...I just had a thought of who they might be!
</line><line>Luke:
Me too! There were those two weird-looking <textEffects>rogues</textEffects>, right? I think they were called...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Robbs and Muggs...you mean? <textEffects>(That's the pair that waylaid Espella in the woods that one time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Espella, you wouldn't happen to know what became of those two, would you?
</line><line>Espella:
Actually, yes, I do... They were rehabilitated and are both currently working in the library.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But apart from them...we don't have any other suspects, do we?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, in that case, I suggest we all set out to the woods and take a look around for ourselves.
</line><line>Luke:
Good thinking, Professor! Sounds like another exciting case to crack!
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah! Come on, Nick! We're up for this too, right?!
</line>

<line><i>Red Flower Lake</i>
</line><line>Layton:
According to the witnesses, this is where they were sighted... Two clearly suspicious characters... supposedly <textEffects>basking in the sun</textEffects> somewhere around here.
</line><line>Espella:
They certainly sound like a couple of laid-back villains, if they were "basking in the sun"...
</line><line>Maya:
Whooooooa! Th-there they are...over there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yep... I see them too. Definitely suspicious...
</line><line>Luke:
I'm not sure I've ever seen a more suspicious-looking pair of characters!
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Luke... I must admit, they somewhat resemble the kind of image one often sees on "<textEffects>most wanted</textEffects>" posters...
</line><line>Judge:
After my many years as a judge, I have recently found myself wondering... What exactly do we mean by "<textEffects>crime</textEffects>"? How exactly can we define it...?
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
........................ We are no more than bubbles, being carried by a great river. Drifting this way and that, until we disappear... The tiny sound of the bubbles bursting goes unheard by anyone. And yet...they undoubtedly do make their sound... BLAM!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... That is a unique way of looking at things. I, meanwhile, believe... that the world is not as simple as: "<textEffects>those who use witchcraft are criminals</textEffects>".
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
........................ Even so, the warm wind blows over the grassy plains, quietly causing the red flowers to sway...before moving on. No one sees the wind as it moves... It is only felt by the flowers, as they are touched.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Luke:
They seem to be having some kind of complicated, high-level conversation...
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Luke. It would appear they're involved in deep philosophical discussion.
</line><line>Espella:
That's just like Mr Wordsmith... He always sounds so poetic and deep.
</line><line>Maya:
You can say that again. I think it's a bit too deep for me... I'm lost!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Honestly, I'm not sure whether what I'm hearing is sublime or ridiculous...
</line><line>Judge:
I feel...that after a year since I stepped down as a judge, I still cannot say with utter confidence... what path my life should take, or what on earth I should aim for now.
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
........................ There were days when even I wished to simply become the wind... But if I were to become the wind... I would never again be able to slurp upon spaghetti.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... To be honest with you, I had never even considered that. It would seem that I should continue on my current path, at least for the time being...
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
........................ Whatever the case, I cannot even consider a world in which one is not free to slurp upon one's spaghetti... Where is that kindly neighbour who will free me from my fate this evening...and from that despicable monster we call money?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Luke:
Somehow...listening to them talking... is making me feel all profound.
</line><line>Maya:
Me too...I suddenly have a profound feeling that I'd like to eat some spaghetti right about now!
</line><line>Espella:
It's just like Mr Wordsmith... Always the most <textEffects>tasteful</textEffects> choice of words.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Personally, I get the feeling he's trying to persuade the judge to buy him <textEffects>dinner</textEffects> tonight, in a roundabout sort of way.
</line><line>Judge:
...Oh? Well, I never... This is a most distinguished turnout we have here!
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Fortuitous meetings are no more than inevitable vicissitudes within the natural ebb and flow of our lives...
</line><line>Judge:
May I ask what it is that brings you all to an out-of-the-way place like this?
</line><line>Layton:
Ah...well... Actually...
</line><line>Maya:
We came here to check on reports of two <textEffects>suspicious characters</textEffects> said to have been <textEffects>basking in the sun</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Tactful as always, Maya...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Two suspicious characters, you say? And you took the trouble to come all the way out here just to warn us? Well, don't worry, we'll keep our eyes open!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Missing the point as always, Your Honour...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
By the way, what brings you to this neck of the woods?
</line><line>Judge:
Well...it's a little embarrassing really... I was just seeking advice from my wise companion here. I've been wondering how to proceed in life, now that I've stepped down from my post.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And did you find the answer to your question from Wordsmith?
</line><line>Judge:
Well...to be honest... I have no idea what he was talking about...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Is that so...? <textEffects>(Why am I not surprised to hear that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I was getting into a bit of a nervous sweat just about the time you arrived.
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I am merely floating on a warm breeze, shedding warm tears, like flower petals dancing in the wind.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
So! You decided to become a <textEffects>fortune teller</textEffects>, huh?
</line><line>Judge:
...Yes. When I met you all about a year ago, I came to realise... My beliefs were being changed by the Story. The belief that "<textEffects>witches must be guilty</textEffects>" was just an illusion. This world is incomprehensible, like a dark and puzzling labyrinth.
</line><line>Layton:
In a sense, <textEffects>puzzles</textEffects> are a microcosm of that <textEffects>labyrinth</textEffects>, or so I like to believe.
</line><line>Maya:
...And that's why you decided to become a fortune teller?
</line><line>Judge:
That's right. I felt that as a fortune teller, I could help those who came to consult me find their way forward to a brighter future. But to tell you the truth... I felt my <textEffects>appearance</textEffects> might be well suited to the role, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Personally I think your appearance fits the role of "suspicious character" better...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But when it comes to giving people advice, I came to realise it's not that easy...
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Really...? I believe...all is well within one's grasp! The answer to the ultimate puzzle of life...
</line><line>Luke:
Huh...? Please don't say it's 42...
</line><line>Maya:
Mr Wordsmith!
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
When faced with a perplexing puzzle, the way forward is to broaden one's outlook... Then, while holding that broadened view... look back upon that same puzzle.
</line><line>Espella:
Certainly...when I have a problem, I'm often unable to see anything else.
</line><line>Luke:
So we should broaden our outlook, then... That sounds like good advice!
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
And then you should make use of your hands, eyes and all of your senses to feel out a solution. If you look around you...at those bushes... or that tree over there...there's always a <textEffects>hint</textEffects> waiting to be found. Of this, you can be certain... <textEffects>Hint 1</textEffects>, <textEffects>Hint 2</textEffects>, <textEffects>Hint 3</textEffects>...and naturally, the <textEffects>Super Hint</textEffects> are waiting there for you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick! Check this out! I found some <textEffects>hint coins</textEffects> in that tree and bushes over there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(Are you kidding me?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
Well, when it comes to solving puzzles, "each to his own" is what I say. A puzzle is a <textEffects>labyrinth</textEffects> born of the human intellect. However, occasionally... there are puzzles that can prove most refreshing when <textEffects>unravelled</textEffects> at the drop of a hat. A metaphorical hat, that is. Take the following puzzle, for example...
</line>

<line>
Maya:
Boy, I just LOVE this kind of puzzle! <textEffects>Two choices</textEffects> means you only have to try it <textEffects>twice</textEffects>!
</line><line>Luke:
Did you really just say that, Maya...?
</line><line>Maya:
So here's my amazing strategy: step one, try UP just to see what happens. Step two: VICTORY POSE! Turns out that UP was totally the <textEffects>right answer</textEffects>!
</line><line>Espella:
Well, I'm not sure what to make of that strategy...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know, I've just realised what a mysterious object the <textEffects>hint coin</textEffects> really is.
</line><line>Luke:
How do you mean, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I always set out to get all the coins and leave no stone unturned... But then, when I get stuck in a puzzle, I never end up using them... Not a one. Sort of feels like I'm <textEffects>wasting</textEffects> a coin, like I hate seeing the hint coin counter go <textEffects>down</textEffects>, you know?
</line><line>Luke:
Ah... I know exactly what you mean!
</line><line>Maya:
That just goes to show what a <textEffects>cheapskate</textEffects> you are, Nick!
</line><line>Layton:
I'm not sure that's entirely true, Miss Fey.
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>Nonsense...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I've seen and done a lot of things during this long life of mine... On the great ocean of puzzles, the traveller who carries a wealth of coins runs the risk of being pulled under by their weight.
</line><line>Maya:
Whoa... That sounds like it belongs in a fortune cookie!
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Which is why... whenever I tackle any puzzle... I always look at the <textEffects>Super Hint</textEffects> before I start!
</line><line>Layton:
........................
</line><line>Phoenix:
........................
</line><line>Luke:
........................
</line><line>Maya:
........................
</line><line>Espella:
........................
</line><line>Judge:
While it may be true that the world is full of things that are difficult to fathom... By your own words, Wordsmith... I find you quite clearly, in a word, <textEffects>guilty</textEffects>!
</line><line>Vigilante (Wordsmith):
........................ I am merely floating on a warm breeze, shedding warm tears, like flower petals basking in the twilight of a very long day...
</line><line>Layton:
Well, as I've said already... When it comes to solving puzzles, "each to his own" is what I always say.
