<line>Maya:
Umm... Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it?
</line><line>Maya:
I've got a confession to make... I'm terrible at figuring out magic tricks...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Magic tricks?
</line><line>Maya:
Yep. Magic tricks are by their very definition tricks, right? But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.
</line><line>Maya:
But but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?
</line><line>Maya:
Let's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heh...
</line><line>Maya:
First she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Really? Was it kinda like this...?
</line><line>Maya:
WHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician! See this is why I just can't figure out magic... I'm no good at it... Especially hard tricks like flying away from the scene of a murder...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You'll take all the fun out of magic if you keep trying to figure it out.

<line>Max:
Oh! My sweeties!! You mind hurrying up and getting me out of this place!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We're doing our best, Max. Just hang in there.
</line><line>Max:
A little while ago, some people from a local TV station came by... They said that, since I'm a famed magician, "Let's make your very own TV special!"
</line><line>Maya:
Really? What kind of TV special?
</line><line>Max:
"Maximillion Galactica: The Great Prison Escape" It would be aired live.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! That sounds like it would be an awesome special!
</line><line>Max:
But if I do the special before I'm acquitted, they'll never let me out of here for real.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, it would surely be an unnecessary addition to your troubles with the law.
</line><line>Max:
That's what I was thinking... But the production staff is already working on the show! If you don't get me out quick, I'll have no choice but to stage a real prison break.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You seem awfully calm about that possibility...
</line><line>Max:
I'd have no choice. It would be a contractual obligation... That's show business.

<line>Maya:
You hear that? It sounds like two people arguing...
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Alright, let's do it. Are you ready?</textEffects>
</line><line>Ben:
Y-Yes... A-Ah... Wait...
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Quit your whining! Let's just give this a shot already! Alright! Let's go!</textEffects>

</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>What are you doing!? Gently-down-the-stream! C'mon, you know that!!</textEffects>
</line><line>Ben:
I'm trying my best, but... Trilo, this just isn't going to work...
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Do you enjoy saying dumb things? You're going to have to be on your own someday! If you can't handle something as simple as this, was are you going to do then!?</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hello Ben. Hello to you too, Trilo.
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>What are you doing here!? Can't you see we're on a secret crash training course!?</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
I'm sorry...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Secret crash training! Whoa.
</line><line>Ben:
Yes. Trilo wouldn't give up until I said we'd try out his idea for a new routine. So... We were trying to sing in a round for our new ventriloquism act.
</line><line>Maya:
In a round!? You can really do that!? That's incredible!
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>See! See! Even they are surprised by the idea!! I told you!!</textEffects>
</line><line>Ben:
They're not the only ones!! You even surprised me with your idea!!
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Once we've got a grip on the basics, then it's just a matter of practice!</textEffects>
</line><line>Ben:
Y-Y-You t-t-think so?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to give this back to you.
</line><line>Trilo:
<textEffects>Ahh! There it is!! Now that I've got this ring back, it's time to take one more shot at Regina!</textEffects>

<line>Gumshoe:
Oh, it's you two.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You look like you just got hit by a truck. Shouldn't you get some rest?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Nah... I'm taking a rest right now, pal. I've been listening to come crazy clown's life story. Ms. von Karma told me to come down here and do this for her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Being bossed around by a woman... I know how you feel.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Let me tell you something, pal. Listening to that old clown sucks all your energy. Every time he's done talkin' he looks at you like you should be doing something...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I know that, pal. Do you have any idea how much your face hurts if you fake laughing that much?
</line><line>Maya:
Franziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No way, pal. You're not gonna get me to backbite a woman with a whip. No way.
</line><line>Maya:
Why are you defending her?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Prosecutor von Karma's always got her eyes on us. And every time you definitely don't want her to show up... *poof* There she is!! Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
She's <textEffects>directly above</textEffects> us as we speak.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? How's that possible?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
According to the clown, the criminal jumped <textEffects>from here</textEffects> and disappeared into the sky. If that's what happened, it means the killer passed right by <textEffects>this window</textEffects>, pal.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>The acrobat's</textEffects> got his room up on the third floor, it seems. Pretty soon, Ms. von Karma's gonna start her investigation up there. So don't get any ideas of going up to the acrobat's room, got it pal?
</line><line>Maya:
*shivers* V-Von Karma...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Once she's done with her investigation, I think I'll go up there and check it out.)</textEffects>

If he was here, you would have been able to tell even before you stepped into his room. I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... "Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!"
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself?

I always thought he was just thinking up new jokes.

Anyways, they were an incredible team... Cut down at the same time...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
"Cut down at the same time..." That was where he slipped, and that's how I figured it out. You two ended up wrapped up in the <textEffects>same accident together</textEffects>, like always.
</line><line>Acro:
I see... But an accident is an accident. It wasn't anyone's fault...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I still haven't broken Acro's Psyche-Lock... He must have an incredibly deep seeded secret...)</textEffects> "It wasn't anyone's fault..." Do you care to explain more?
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro, I know you are still hiding something from me... <textEffects>Maybe something you <span style="color:#E16935">don't seem to like much</textEffects> is the reason you're being evasive.</span>
</line>


<line>Acro:
R-Regina...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You always seem calm and collected, until you start talking about her. Saying things like she is "cruel"...
</line><line>Acro:
Well done, Mr. Attorney. You've got quite the set of eagle eyes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know... Her tiger tried to attack me...
</line><line>Acro:
Regent tried to attack you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Twice.
</line><line>Acro:
Hah hah hah... He wasn't serious I'm sure... You're not trying to insinuate that I believe she spurred on Léon to attack Bat, are you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Acro:
Léon was never taught a command to attack people. Regina isn't capable of doing anything like that. Besides, Regina had no reason to want to hurt my little brother. Regina and Bat were such good friends back then...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you still hate Regina! I've got proof of it!
</line><line>Acro:
What!? What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Doh! Maybe I overdid it again... But if I can <span style="color:#E16935">hand something</textEffects> over to Acro, maybe it'll...)</span> <textEffects>Here's proof that you had it out for Regina all along!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Acro:
T-This... Where'd you get it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Regina posted it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria. Before that, it was in her pocket.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Regina:
Hmm... I guess I noticed it was in there around breakfast time. I always take Acro his breakfast in the morning.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You wrote this, and then you put it in her pocket... That's right, isn't it?
</line><line>Acro:
... That's right. Well done Mr. Wright...

<line>Acro:
Bat and Regina... They were such great friends. Oh yeah... I wanted you to take a look at this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it?
</line><line>Acro:
This is the scarf my brother was wearing when Léon attacked him.
</line><line>Maya:
Gross... It's covered in blood.
</line><line>Acro:
This scarf... Was a present from Regina to my brother on the day of the accident.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm...
</line><line>Acro:
When he did it, he looked like he was smiling...
</line><line>Phoenix:
He?
</line><line>Acro:
Léon, obviously.
</line><line>Maya:
What!?
</line><line>Acro:
When he bit down on Bat's head... The expression on Léon's face looked like a grin.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know!! Moe said the same thing...
</line><line>Maya:
What do you think it all means?
</line><line>???:
I'll be taking that scarf if you don't mind...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Von Karma?
</line><line>von Karma:
I've already heard everything! So hand over the scarf.
</line><line>Maya:
But the scarf is evidence in the trial!
</line><line>von Karma:
That is for me to decide. I think we should begin our preparations now, Acro.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Preparations?
</line><line>von Karma:
I've served a summons on Acro to appear in court tomorrow as a witness. Acro, we'll talk more at the prosecutor's office.
</line><line>Maya:
Acro... A witness!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Come Acro. Let's go to the office.
</line><line>Acro:
Yes, ma'am.
</line><line>Maya:
Now what do we do, Nick? How are we going to handle tomorrow?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out...
</line><line>Maya:
Look at you all full of confidence!! You must have found something you can use!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is all beginning to come together now...)</textEffects>
