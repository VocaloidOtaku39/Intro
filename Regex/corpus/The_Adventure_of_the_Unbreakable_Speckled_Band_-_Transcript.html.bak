<title>The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band</title>

<line>
<i>Anime cutscene</i>
Detective:
So then...let us unravel this mystery and discover what events led to this curious murder. Pray, do excuse me. The cabin door was bolted from the inside when the man was killed. No marks to suggest the bolt was tampered with in any way. So this would appear to be a locked room mystery. In his final moments, the victim scrawled a message on the floor. Hm, almost certainly with the ink from this upset bottle. A Russian word... So the victim was a Russian man, then. And the letters are well formed, suggesting he was compos mentis at the time. Hm, this is a most extraordinary script. And evidently...not penned by the same hand as this message. In fact, I deduce it was written by someone of a different nationality. This paper seal was placed just prior to the incident... by the victim himself, I would venture. Well... what have we here?
</line><line>Sailor 1:
Who are you and WHAT do you think you are doing here?!
</line><line>Sailor 2:
Da, da! No one must touch before maritime police come! We must wait!
</line><line>Detective:
Shh! That won't be necessary. You see...in less than five seconds from now, I will reveal the killer to you. 
</line><line>Sailor 1:
D-Don't be absurd! This is murder! And in cabin locked from inside!
</line><line>Detective:
Ah yes, the locked room. But that mystery is paper thin. 
</line><line>Susato:
You, you don't mean...the culprit is in there?!
</line><line>Sailor 3:
Wh-Who are you and where have you come from?
</line><line>Detective:
I'm a Great British consulting detective. The only one in the world. Herlock Sholmes. I presume...you must have heard of me.

</line><line>???:
Hmph. So, you wake up now, hm? 
</line><line>Sailor:
We had to drag you out of the wardrobe. I do not believe how you could not wake up. You are true cold-blooded man. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You... Haah... You found me, then.
</line><line>Sailor:
Da. We found you. And now you pay...<textEffects>kriminal</textEffects>! How long are you hiding in that tiny wardrobe, hm?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry... 
</line><line>Sailor:
Now you have been found, it is time to admit your crimes. Unless you want to find out how cold the ocean is, hm?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No no! I'll tell you everything!
</line><line>???:
There's only one thing I'd like to know from you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...! <textEffects>(Isn't that...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Why did you do it? Why did you <textEffects>take his life</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
M-Miss Susato! ......... Wait, what did you just say? 'Take...his life'...? 
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um... Where, where is he? Where's <textEffects>Kazuma</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Sailor:
Hah! You pretend you do not know?! You are a wolf in the sheep's pelt! You are <textEffects>the killer</textEffects>! Do not try to make excuses!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
</line><line>Susato:
Kazuma-sama was... Kazuma-sama's <textEffects>body</textEffects> was discovered not long ago. Here...in this very cabin. That was bolted shut from the inside.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
His, his <textEffects>body</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Sailor:
Please... ...do not try to tell us you were doing this terrible thing in your sleep!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Kazuma's <textEffects>dead</textEffects>...? But...he can't be... ......... And these <textEffects>handcuffs</textEffects>... Surely you don't think I...?
</line><line>Susato:
I have to know... Why did you take Kazuma-sama's life? Answer me! Please!
</line><line>No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line>
<center>Kazuma... It was just two short weeks ago...</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Are you sure about this? Won't we get in trouble?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! Don't you find it fun being a stowaway? Besides, how else could you come to England with me to study?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was really something else when they brought your luggage in here earlier, though. The way that Russian crewman just tossed your travelling case onto the floor... ...I thought I was going to die!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Yes, I still can't quite believe that. I really didn't think you'd be able to fit inside my trunk. You must be even less of a man than you look!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hey! Honestly, I thought I'd broken every bone in my body!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Well, it's about fifty days until we dock in Great Britain. But if you confine yourself to my cabin here, I don't expect anyone will discover you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh, I hope not! I get the feeling those Russians wouldn't be very forgiving of a stowaway...
</line><line>Kazuma:
They're a sturdy bunch, that's for sure.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What I want to know is, why do we need to keep it a secret from the young lady?
</line><line>Kazuma:
From our faithful Judicial Assistant Mikotoba, you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
From YOUR close friend, more to the point. Surely we could confide in her, couldn't we? I don't believe she'd give me away.
</line><line>Kazuma:
No, but if she knew what we'd done, that would make her guilty by association. It's best that only you and I know about this.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm, I suppose so... 
</line><line>Kazuma:
Anyway, it's about the time that the steward is supposed to come and clean the cabin. I know it's cramped, but you'd better get in there, I think. It won't be for long. And anyway, compared to hiding inside my travelling case, it'll be a breeze. 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, but what if the steward decides to open the wardrobe for some reason? Then I'll be in for it.
</line><line>Kazuma:
Stop worrying. I tell you what. Why don't you write 'Keep out' or something on this piece of paper?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Kazuma:
Then I can stick it over the wardrobe doors once you're inside.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't know...

Sailor:
We leave you at next port. Stay quiet until then. Don't make more trouble for yourself... ...Murderer!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! I'm not a murderer!
</line><line>Sailor:
Da! You said before! You said you admit everything about your crimes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! That's not right! I mean, yes, I did stow away on this ship, but... Murdering my best friend?
</line><line>Sailor:
No one else could have done it. Admit the truth!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...Susato-san...
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Please...tell me what happened! I need to know!
</line><line>Susato:
......... Very well. But there is something I would like to ask of you, too.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh, those eyes... She looks like she's ready to destroy me... This nightmare is getting worse by the minute... I suppose all I can do is try to find out what really happened...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Susato:
Don't try to go anywhere! You're <textEffects>the perpetrator</textEffects> of this crime. You can't leave, I can't allow that to happen.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...I'm sorry. But Kazuma was killed right under my nose here. And...I didn't do anything to stop it! And now I'm supposed to just sit around, my hands tied, while whoever did this walks free? No! I can't allow that to happen!
</line><line>Susato:
Well, what do you propose to do, then?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm going to investigate. I'm going to find out exactly what happened here! I'm going to work out who took Kazuma's life, and how and why they did it! So I'm sorry...but you're going to have to excuse me!
</line><line>Susato:

<center>Haiiiiiii-YA!</center>

Ryunosuke:
What the-
</line><line>Susato:
That was a <textEffects>Susato Takedown</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A Su-Susato what? <textEffects>(What martial art form is that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I'm going to need you to prove it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Prove 'it'?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, Your innocence. I need <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But, but how am I supposed to...?
</line><line>Susato:
Have you forgotten already? What you achieved just a few weeks ago. You successfully <textEffects>defended</textEffects> yourself in a court of law.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah... <textEffects>(I see... She's expecting me to <span style="color:#E16935">present</textEffects> some conclusive evidence.)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I have to get Susato-san to believe me! I'll show her some evidence right now that proves I'm not guilty of this awful crime!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Tell me, when I was <textEffects>discovered</textEffects> in the wardrobe before... ...was this piece of paper stuck over the doors?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, yes, it was. I remember clearly.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I thought so. Kazuma always put it in place whenever I went to sleep in there. Just in case the cabin steward or another crew member decided to look inside. So naturally, he did the same <textEffects>last night</textEffects> as well.
</line><line>Susato:
Ah! Yes, of course! The gentleman who discovered you peeled that <textEffects>sign</textEffects> from the wardrobe doors...before he opened them.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But if I were truly the culprit... ...I couldn't have climbed back inside the wardrobe and stuck this on the outside of the doors on my own.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes... That's quite true.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...it's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects> that I killed Kazuma!
</line><line>Susato:
......... ......... Well... Even if you are sprawled hopelessly on the floor... ...I can see why Kazuma-sama thought so highly of you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you...Susato-san. Now, do you think perhaps you could help me up?
</line><line>Susato:
Well, in the light of that evidence... ...I don't see any reason why I should stop you from <textEffects>investigating</textEffects> in here at least.

<line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you! So you finally believe me?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm sorry... No.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm not sure yet. I can't rule out the possibility that you used some sort of conjuring trick to put the sign back in position.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What does she think I am, a magician?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
For now, I suggest you <textEffects>investigate</textEffects> as thoroughly as possible in here. I'll do the same.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright! Let's get to work, Susato-san!
</line><line>Susato:
Please don't misunderstand me. I still have my doubts.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh.
</line><line>Susato:
I shall be watching you, to make sure you do nothing that might disturb the crime scene. I wouldn't want you using your conjuring tricks to destroy evidence, for example.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
R-Right... <textEffects>(Well anyway, I should make a start on investigating in here. Examine everything I can. Kazuma, I swear... I will <span style="color:#E16935">avenge</textEffects> your death!)</span>

</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear, that won't do.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! What's the matter, Susato-san?
</line><line>Susato:
I don't suppose you're as foolish as me in that regard, are you, Naruhodo-san? I'm sure you're careful to look all around using [D-pad / B M], aren't you? Now, let's investigate all corners of this cabin!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! Let's do that! <textEffects>(I suppose my field of vision has been rather small until now...)</textEffects>

Oh! How did he...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You've noticed the man, too, have you? I've no idea who he is, or how he got in here. But he looks suspicious. And tall. Suspiciously tall!
</line><line>Susato:
...! Naruhodo-san, don't tell me... Do you really not know who that is?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, well...no. I don't have any foreign friends or acquaintances at all. <textEffects>(He doesn't look like a member of the crew. There's something very...unusual about him. And is he investigating Kazuma's desk, or is he just playing on it? I can't tell.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Well! In that case...we simply must talk with him!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Am I imagining it, or does Susato-san look almost uncontrollably excited?)</textEffects>

By the way, I expect that you've noticed already, but just in case... If you press [A / Space] on people when they're in the cross hairs, you can <textEffects>converse</textEffects> with them.

<line>Ryunosuke:
Um...excuse me.
</line><line>???:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Excuse me! Do you have a moment?
</line><line>???:
Shh! This is a critical point in my investigation. .........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Maybe I should leave him alone. He seems a little unfriendly.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, perhaps that would be for the best.
</line><line>???:
Greetings! I hope I haven't kept you long?
</line><line>Susato:
Agh!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, what exactly were you doing on Kazuma's desk just now?
</line><line>???:
......... ...Ah, I see. Fascinating.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Uh...sorry? What do you see? <textEffects>(It feels like he's <span style="color:#E16935">looking right through me</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>???:
Oh yes. Everything is clear now. The train of reasoning has run its course. My deductions have crystalised. You... ...have been in <textEffects>Afghanistan</textEffects>, I perceive. Just recently returned, if I'm not mistaken.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry? ...WHAT?!
</line><line>???:
And now, whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you find yourself in <textEffects>a most troubling predicament</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! <textEffects>(Well, that's true at least.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
But, but how...?
</line><line>???:
'How the deuce did I know that?' perhaps? It was really a most elementary deduction. Hardly worth explaining.
</line><line>Susato:
Have you perhaps...managed to deduce anything else?
</line><line>???:
But of course. A great many things. There is no mystery, my dear madam. For example... ...you have fled your native land of <textEffects>Russia</textEffects>, being, as you are, <textEffects>a merciless revolutionary</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>???:
You leave <textEffects>sixteen</textEffects> victims of <textEffects>assassination</textEffects> in your wake, and now travel to England to blow up <textEffects>the Crystal Tower</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!!
</line><line>???:
And! When the <textEffects>beribboned</textEffects> occupant of this very cabin discovered your identity, you <textEffects>ended his life</textEffects>, too! Yes...I believe that summarises the facts beautifully. No need to hide the truth now. Nothing deceives these eyes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Erm, just to be clear... You are talking about me, are you?
</line><line>???:
Certainly I am. Do you see another in this cabin who fits the bill? A Russian assassin with sixteen victims to his name?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I don't even see ONE person who fits the bill!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
......... So it's true. It was you who did this to Kazuma-sama.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Susato:
And, and you're plotting a revolution, too... It's shameful behavior, Naruhodo-san. Absolutely wicked!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No...listen, there's no way I-
</line><line>Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA! Now explain yourself! Tell me everything!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is ridiculous!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
How could you do it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
For pity's sake, open your eyes! I'm not a Russian revolutionary! Obviously!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh... Forgive me...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And as for you! What kind of deduction was that?! You were just saying the first thing that came into your head!
</line><line>???:
Ah, but was I not right? Whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you do find yourself in a most troubling predicament...do you not?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, maybe.
</line><line>???:
Hah! There you have it, you see! What do you make of that? Hm?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, to be honest... ...this ship is en route to England, and I'm in handcuffs at the scene of a murder. So...I'm not really sure you could call it 'deduction'. It's more plain '<textEffects>observation</textEffects>'.
</line><line>???:
Indeed! And observation, my dear boy, is the basis of all deduction. My method is founded upon the observation of trifles, you see. I announce my findings with a brassy certitude... ...and more often than not, I'm right!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Haah... I don't think you introduced yourself.
</line><line>???:
Ah, my apologies. How remiss of me. I am none other than the greatest detective of the century, known to men and women the world over.
</line><line>Sholmes:
The inimitable <textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
So...it's really you? The actual Herlock Sholmes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
The very same! The inimitable ACTUAL <textEffects>Herlock Sholmes</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you know this man, Susato-san?
</line><line>Susato:
The most famous detective in the world? Naruhodo-san! Of course I do! There's nobody who hasn't heard of him!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What planet have I been living on then...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
We must ask him what he's deduced! He will have worked out the entire case already, I'm sure!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Really? Why do I feel uneasy about this...?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Sholmes:
So...I believe I've given you enough to consider for the time being at least.
</line><line>Susato:
Ah, do you have somewhere to go?
</line><line>Sholmes:
As it happens, the victim's writings in his <textEffects>diary</textEffects> have piqued my interest. The matter warrants further investigation, I believe. ...And if I am still too long, the seasickness takes hold.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, I suppose... ...you're thinking of investigating the cabin next door, which the ventilator connects to?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Great detectives are a curious breed. Our minds rebel at stagnation. We crave mental exaltation. So yes, I intend to investigate. Hence the truth will become clear soon enough.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you think perhaps...! That we could go with you?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm...no, that would be somewhat complicated.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? But why?

A simple glance at your wrists should reveal the answer.

<textEffects>(Oh...these...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
After all, you're the prime suspect in this matter...no?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's no point trying to turn it into a question. You're the one who decided I was the culprit in the first place.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Whatever do you mean? I have no recollection of naming you as the culprit at any point.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... You must be joking! You, you just said it! Only a moment ago!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Dear me, you are clearly misguided. I would have no cause to say such a thing.
</line><line>Susato:
Well actually, Mr Sholmes... I did hear you say that, too.
</line><line>Sholmes:
You're quite sure? ...Well, that's very strange. I wouldn't have said you had the face of a criminal, you know? ...Not...really.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So what, were you looking at my knees before? Some great detective you are...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well anyway. That was then and this is now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
What I mean, sir, is this: If you are the culprit, then you must play the part more convincingly! Roll over and accept your fate! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Now he's just being plain rude. And off he goes, having just laughed in my face... His sense of humour's as twisted as his name...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Naruhodo-san! What are you just standing there for?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm?
</line><line>Susato:
We must go and investigate the cabin next door as well!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Aren't you forgetting something? What about these? There's no way I can-
</line><line>Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA! After Kazuma-sama spent his dying moments struggling to leave us a clue, you're willing to give up?! You're just going to roll over and accept your fate?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh... <textEffects>(As if you gave me any choice in the rolling over part...)</textEffects> I think we still have some investigation to finish off in here first, don't we? Let's carry on examining what we can in this cabin while we wait for a chance to slip next door.
</line><line>Susato:
Good idea! 
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The situation doesn't look good for me, but there are still things I can do to help myself. And I owe it to Kazuma to do everything I can to find a way out of this...and bring the real culprit to justice!)</textEffects>

Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Whew, I'm finally out of that cabin...)</textEffects> I have to admit, this isn't quite what I was expecting. It's less spacious out here than I thought it would be. And this is the most luxurious accommodation...
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, indeed. Kazuma-sama was being sent on this study tour by the government. That's why he was being put up in <textEffects>a first-class cabin</textEffects>. Even still, this is about twice as large as my accommodation in steerage.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really? That must be awful. Oh! Look over there! That's another crewman keeping watch. And he looks enormous! Even if he is sitting down!

The door next to him leads to the second-class accommodation. I suppose he's making sure that no one comes in here who shouldn't.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I suppose... <textEffects>(Like people in handcuffs?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Naruhodo-san, you look like a little boy visiting a toy shop for the first time. I would have thought you'd be used to the ship by now. We've been at sea for two weeks already.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well yes, I know. But the thing is... ...I was inside Kazuma's trunk when I first came aboard. And ever since then I've been shut up inside that little wardrobe.
</line><line>Susato:
...It must have been a very trying time for you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Please, don't give me that pitying look.

I'm about to break the door down!

Mr Sholmes!

???:
Who, who are you?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(A Western gentleman? This man looks <span style="color:#E16935">Russian</textEffects> to me.)</span> We, we heard a woman scream.
</line><line>???:
A woman? Don't be absurd! As you can see...there's nobody but me in this cabin.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(True. This old man does appear to be the only person in here. But in that case...who just screamed?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Old Man:
Get out! All of you! Now!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Please excuse the intrusion, but... You're Mr Grimesby Roylott, I believe?
</line><line>Roylott:
Yes, that's me. And you are...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I am the one and only - the actual Herlock Sholmes! You've heard of me, no doubt.
</line><line>Roylott:
No.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I am a great detective among great detectives! One who adorns the covers of popular magazines, no less! So I assure you, you may trust me completely!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The man uses that magazine like a business card.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Roylott:
A detective? Hm, I do not trust detectives.
</line><line>Sholmes:
We distinctly heard <textEffects>a scream</textEffects> emanating from within these walls. But there wouldn't appear to be a lady concealing herself within the wardrobe this time... ...so might I be so bold as to ask you to open that small travelling case?
</line><line>Roylott:
Wha...? Don't be stupid! How could anyone fit in a small trunk like that?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well it's quite fashionable these days, is it not? Travelling inside one's trunk.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Don't look at me.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my- Did, did you see that, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! <textEffects>(The case just <span style="color:#E16935">shook</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Roylott:
Leave! Now! Otherwise I'll call the steward!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So this is Kazuma's neighbour... Mr Grimesby Roylott. There's no doubt about it... This strange Russian man is hiding something!)</textEffects>

I couldn't agree more. Let's see if we can find some clues before that burly sailor returns!

<line>Ryunosuke:
Um...do you have a moment, please, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
You need only address me as Sholmes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That's...what I just did, isn't it?)</textEffects> Well, um, Mr Sholmes...what were you doing in there?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why, I was resting, of course.
</line><line>Susato:
Resting?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. I was contemplating our sea voyage from the confines of the wardrobe whilst waiting. Waiting for the inevitable time...that you would need to call my great powers of detection into service.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! 
</line><line>Sholmes:
And it would seem that the hour is upon us now. The time has come! Am I mistaken?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, um... <textEffects>(No, actually. You're spot on...for once.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Observe closely... Our Russian host in this cabin, Mr Roylott, is clearly trying to hide something. And do you know what is the most effective weapon to use against a Russian <textEffects>hiding a secret</textEffects>? Why, <textEffects>the truth</textEffects>, of course! Though it should be pointed out that such methods are not exclusively for the Russians.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Riiight...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Can you imagine how the Russian will react when the secret he guards so closely is exposed? Would you like to witness it?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, yes! Please!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well then... What you are about to see may well astound you. For I am about to apply my great detective's greatly admired <textEffects>great deduction</textEffects> to the case!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sholmes:
Could this man BE a more hackneyed portrayal of a dubious Russian, I ask you?
</line><line>Roylott:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
From time to time, it occurs to me... ...is the fellow dubious on account of his Russianness, or Russian on account of his dubiousness?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I, I really don't think either of those things should be occurring to you...or anyone.
</line><line>Susato:
That's right. And Mr Sholmes... I know this man's beard and dark glasses are hard to ignore, especially on first meeting, but I once read: 'It is a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.'
</line><line>Sholmes:
Shh! I must have complete silence! .........
</line><line>Roylott:
Wh-What are you doing? Why are you peering at my face like that?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, just as I thought. Yes, I have quite made up my mind now.
</line><line>Roylott:
Hm?
</line><line>Sholmes:
There can be no other explanation that accommodates all the facts. Mr Roylott... I have reached <textEffects>two</textEffects> incontrovertible conclusions.
</line><line>Roylott:
What, what do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Number one! Your <textEffects>true identity</textEffects>...is that of <textEffects>a villain</textEffects>! Using those shears, you are about to end the existence of something most dear. ...Are you not?
</line><line>Roylott:
Huh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And number two! The other conclusion I have drawn... You are...at this very moment no less, in the midst of committing a most grievous <textEffects>crime</textEffects>! Beneath that beard, your mouth quivers with nervous tension as you realise you have been discovered! ...Does it not?
</line><line>Roylott:
Agh!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Naruhodo-san! I never imagined I would witness one of Mr Sholmes's <textEffects>great deductions</textEffects> with my own eyes!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That...was a great deduction?
</line><line>Susato:
Nothing can deceive Mr Sholmes! In a single glance, he can <textEffects>deduce all there is to know</textEffects> about a person!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? <textEffects>(What ineffable twaddle!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, I've read about it countless times in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. ...And now I've experienced the astonishing impact of his great deduction firsthand! This is like a dream come true!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I can hardly believe it, but...all the colour has drained from Mr Roylott's face! It looks like somehow, both of Mr Sholmes's conclusions... were <span style="color:#E16935">right</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Roylott:
How...? How could you...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
'How could I possibly know such things?' you wish to say? Very well then, I shall elucidate. I shall explain how it was that I arrived at this pair of conclusions. So do I cordially invite you upon a journey of logical discovery! Let us board the train of reasoning! ...Put plainly, let us work through my deductions together.

<b>The Great Deduction</b>The game is afoot!</center>
<line><b>Topic 1</b>
Old Man's Identity
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, the dubious-looking Russian, Mr Roylott... Obviously, what catches the eye in the first place... ...is the enormous pair of <textEffects>shears</textEffects> in your hand! Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the <textEffects><b>copious beard</b></textEffects>  you sport! Now, moving on... The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of this magnificent beard, Mr Roylott? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.
</line><line>Roylott:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Regard, if you will, this morning's <textEffects>newspaper</textEffects>. In particular, the fascinating front-page article. Which, it would appear, you have read also, Mr Roylott. I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <textEffects><b>article about the revolutionary</b></textEffects>! In translation, the headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. As you cannot fail to observe, the subject of the article possesses an extremely copious beard. Having noted the article yourself, you decided to remove your incriminating facial hair before it gave you away. In short, your <textEffects>true identity</textEffects> is beyond doubt. You are the fearsome Russian revolutionary himself, <textEffects>Vilen Borshevik</textEffects>! ...Not that I've heard of you myself, you understand.
</line><line><b>Topic 1</b>

</line><line><b>Conclusion</b>

</line><line>
<b>Topic 2</b>

</line><line>Sholmes:
Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.
</line><line>Roylott:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And <textEffects>the proof</textEffects> of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Mr Roylott... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.
</line><line>Roylott:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that <textEffects><b>travelling case</b></textEffects>! It is time, I think, that the case be opened and its contents laid bare.
</line><line>Roylott:
No! I refuse!
</line><line>Sholmes:
What could you possibly be concealing inside, we ask? By my estimation... ...<textEffects>a young lady</textEffects>, perhaps. One slight enough to fit therein.
</line><line>Roylott:
D-Don't be absurd!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And what, pray, would be the identity of this young lady in the travelling case? Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find <textEffects>the answer</textEffects>. Yes, the reason you refuse to open your travelling case can equally be found in the pages of this <textEffects><b>newspaper</b></textEffects>. For there is another, most stimulating article... ...if we turn from the fleeing revolutionary... to <textEffects>the back page</textEffects>! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' Such a headline can lead us to but one conclusion. Your crime...is that of <textEffects>abduction</textEffects>! And according to the article, the young lady's name is Nikolina Pavlova. 
</line><line><b>Topic 2</b>

</line><line><b>Conclusion</b>
Kidnapping of a young ballerina
</line><line>Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's <textEffects>great deduction</textEffects>...of this Russian enigma! ...Elementski!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
......... Susato-san... That wasn't one of <textEffects>the great deductions</textEffects> I've been hearing so much about...was it?
</line><line>Susato:
Well, um...the stories are full of Mr Sholmes's brilliant deductions, you know. But that...did seem <textEffects>a little different</textEffects> somehow...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Excuse me, Mr Sholmes! Could you come over here a moment?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Pray, what can I do for you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's about your deductions. Would you mind?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Not at all. Go on.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, to start with, there's the newspaper article. I think we had the same discussion before, but... ...these two men look nothing like each other!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah yes, I recall our discussion earlier. And at the time, I believe I told you... ...that the man is a revolutionary. Well able to revolutionise his own appearance.
</line><line>Susato:
In fairness to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott does look more like this man than you do.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's...not the point. And another thing! The part about him abducting the ballerina...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. A truly startling revelation. At first glance, the case would appear too small to accommodate a young woman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Not just at first glance! It IS too small! Clearly! You'd be lucky to fit a <textEffects>five-year-old</textEffects> child into that case! Even if you pushed really hard!
</line><line>Susato:
I don't suppose the missing ballerina is a five-year-old child, is she?
</line><line>Sholmes:
You mean you don't know? No, the young lady is <textEffects>fifteen</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, I didn't know. How could I?
</line><line>Susato:
Hm... Well, if she's fifteen, then ten years' worth of her would be poking out from the case...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Some years ago, I read something pertinent, I believe. A troupe of men consuming vinegar daily in order to promote a certain litheness in their bodies.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Vinegar?
</line><line>Sholmes:
For such a sour bunch, it would surely be simplicity itself to contort oneself into the confines of that small case.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear. You might be thinking of contortionists in the circus, Mr Sholmes...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh, this whole thing is turning into a circus...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, something's occurred to me about Mr Sholmes's deductions just now... I think his powers of observation are, well...magical! His eyes cut to <textEffects>the heart of a matter</textEffects> almost instantly. It's just...where he directs his <textEffects>attention</textEffects> and his <textEffects>logic</textEffects> that seem a little...off.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Your idea of 'a little' may be a little off itself, Miss Susato.
</line><line>Susato:
It's just one or two <textEffects>key words</textEffects> in his deductions that seem to let him down. So I was wondering if we might perhaps tactfully <textEffects>switch</textEffects> them for alternatives. What do you think?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm... Switch some <textEffects>key words</textEffects> in his deductions...
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, but very tactfully. I feel sure if we could do that... ...we'd unlock the true genius of Mr Sholmes's great deduction!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely the thought that was going through my own mind.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This man is a lot of work...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
At times, I wonder how anyone puts up with me! Ah ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It's not that funny...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, and you, my good fellow...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Take a moment to look at your wrists.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My wrists?
</line><line>Susato:
Ah! Wh-Where are your handcuffs?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Huh?! How, how did...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I felt they may hinder your ability to follow me in our... dance of deduction.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I don't believe it!
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes, you are a marvel!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And don't worry. I shall restore the shackles to your wrists when we are finished.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm not worried. In fact, I'd rather stay like this...

</line><line>Susato:
Hm, I'm not sure... Would you really use shears like that to cut off a beard?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I doubt that's something I'll ever have to worry about. It doesn't quite sit right with me, though.
</line><line>Susato:
It doesn't seem to be sitting right with Mr Roylott, either.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Which means, I suppose, that the deduction is <span style="color:#E16935">wrong</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
Let's try to <textEffects>switch</textEffects> a key word here, Naruhodo-san, and see if it helps matters.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright. But how?
</line><line>Susato:
I think we should start by taking a long, hard look at Mr Roylott.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I wonder if it's really his beard that he intended to use those shears on...
</line><line>Susato:
Exactly. If we do manage to find something that seems to fit the sense of Mr Sholmes's deduction better...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then what?
</line><line>Susato:
Then I'll leave the rest in your capable hands, Naruhodo-san!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Why am I the one to do something about this...?)</textEffects> Well anyway, let's see if there's anything we could even use to switch around in that last sentence. What exactly was Mr Roylott really going to use those enormous shears for?
</line>




<line>
</line>




<line>You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the <textEffects><b>copious beard</b></textEffects> you sport!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What was this bearded Russian planning to cut off with those enormous shears?
</line><line>Susato:
If we look carefully enough, perhaps we'll notice something that will give us a clue. We need to approach this from every angle. We must consider all possibilities!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's easy to say, but alright, let's see if we can work it out. If it wasn't his beard, what WAS the man thinking of cutting?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the <textEffects><b>golden locks</b></textEffects> you sport!
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Indeed. You have identified the precise detail I was intending to expose. Such lush, golden hair certainly does not befit an old man.
</line><line>Roylott:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You're not a man at all! You're <textEffects>a woman</textEffects>! And judging from the length and sheen of your hair...
</line><line>Sholmes:
...One still very much in her youth!
</line><line>Roylott:
Oh no... If only I had managed to cut off my hair, no one would have suspected.
</line><line>Sholmes:
The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of these magnificent locks? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> to shed light on the matter.
</line><line>Roylott:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <textEffects><b>article about the revolutionary</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, that was a shock! I had no idea that old man was really a young woman in disguise! Did you?
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? Why are you staring at me like that?
</line><line>Susato:
...Yes, it was a surprise. Naruhodo-san... You're enjoying this, aren't you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Susato:
You look like you're in your element as you dance around the room deducing the facts with Mr Sholmes.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I'm just doing what we agreed. I'm, I'm not having fun or anything! This is strictly business! Not strictly come-
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, yes, I understand. Say no more.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, let's focus on this next part of Mr Sholmes's deduction, shall we? <textEffects>The evidence</textEffects> that he's picked out doesn't fit the facts at all.
</line><line>Susato:
No, that's true, given that Mr Roylott is actually a woman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly. He - or rather she - can't possibly be this <textEffects>merciless revolutionary</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
I suppose it's because the deduction as a whole has taken a different direction now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...
</line><line>Susato:
Let's switch the evidence for something else. Something that fits the facts as we now understand them.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(For some reason, this <span style="color:#E16935">woman</textEffects> needed to try to hide her true identity. I feel as though I've either read or heard about <textEffects>a young woman</textEffects> in a situation like that recently...)</span> Alright, I'll do my best!
</line>



<line>The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <textEffects><b>article about the revolutionary</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Roylott isn't a merciless revolutionary at all.
</line><line>Susato:
No. He isn't even a 'mister'. Under that disguise, 'he' is a young woman.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And I do feel like we have some evidence here somewhere that might reveal who she really is.
</line><line>Susato:
Let's have another look through all the evidence we've gathered so far and see if we can find it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
The evidence that reveals your true identity is of course...<textEffects><b>the article about the ballerina</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
That's right. You've hit the nail on the head! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' It would appear we are finally able to address you by your true name.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, because your true identity is that of the Novavich Ballet's prima ballerina...
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Miss Nikolina Pavlova!
</line><line>Roylott:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! .........

Mr Sholmes's observational skills are beyond question, Naruhodo-san. Miss Pavlova definitely let her eyes stray to something. And that something will explain everything. We must look around very carefully, and try to work out what she was looking at.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll investigate the area more thoroughly. I agree that there must be something here that will prove what this woman is really guilty of.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
The proof of your crime...is surely this <textEffects><b>tiara</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I believe this tiara is worn on stage by dancers in the Novavich Ballet, is it not? Indeed, it would appear to be identical to the tiara pictured here in this newspaper article. And if the reporting is to be believed, it's an item worth <textEffects>twenty thousand roubles</textEffects>. In summary...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...The crime you have committed...is <textEffects>theft</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, you left your ballet troupe, unlawfully taking their precious tiara with you!
</line><line>Pavlova:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... I have no one. No family. No friends. I am all alone. And...I need money! But I did not steal the tiara. It was a present from... How do you say? An earl? ...Of Prussia. It belongs to me!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This girl is only fifteen years old. And she's <span style="color:#E16935">run away</textEffects> all by herself. She must have been extremely lonely.)</span>
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... Alright, I will tell you everything... There is no point to hiding it now.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Come come, let us not be hasty!
</line><line>Pavlova:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
There remains one unsolved <textEffects>mystery</textEffects> about you.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Mystery? Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
You have staunchly <textEffects>refused</textEffects> to open this travelling case of yours in our presence. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that there exists <textEffects>some reason</textEffects> why you wish it to remain closed. Is that not so...Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Um...
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear girl, there is no sense in playing games with me. Nothing escapes my attention. Indeed, I have a very good idea of <textEffects>the contents</textEffects> of your case, even before I have ever laid eyes on them. Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the <textEffects><b>books on the shelf</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He's completely changed tack with his deduction now!
</line><line>Susato:
I think Mr Sholmes is adapting his logic to the changing circumstances, don't you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Maybe, but why has he suddenly brought the bookshelf into all this? It's just a wild guess, surely!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh... Do you think so?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, it doesn't seem likely that the reason why this young woman doesn't want to open her case... ...would have been written in a book that doesn't even belong to her!
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, that's true. But still... Miss Pavlova certainly did cast her eyes in that direction. I noticed it myself.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then there has to be another reason why she won't open her case. And it must be somewhere in the same area, if that's where her <textEffects>gaze</textEffects> was involuntarily drawn.
</line><line>Susato:
I agree. That's the only answer.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Whatever she has hidden inside that case... ...should be revealed by following her gaze in the direction of the bookcase!)</textEffects>
</line>




<line>
</line>




<line>Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the <textEffects><b>books on the shelf</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
Surely the reason that Miss Pavlova doesn't want to open her travelling case... ...is because there's something inside that she doesn't want us to see.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, it must be what's inside... <textEffects>(Come to think of it... ...we saw the case moving before, didn't we?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I can't imagine what's in there. What could it be?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(What has Miss Pavlova got inside her case? Whatever it is that she is glancing at will probably give us the answer...!)</textEffects> 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the <textEffects><b>Rules of Passage</b></textEffects>! 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
</line><line>Sholmes:
Inside that case of yours, is something <textEffects>forbidden</textEffects> from carriage on this vessel. That is the real reason why you refuse to open it, thus revealing its contents.
</line><line>Pavlova:
I...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As we've seen, the trunk wobbles from time to time. But no weapon or other dangerous item would move of its own accord.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Which leaves but one possibility, Miss Pavlova... Inside your travelling case... ...is the last item listed as forbidden in the vessel's Rules of Passage: <textEffects>a pet</textEffects>!
</line><line>Pavlova:

<line>Ryunosuke:
So clearly, you aren't who you said you were.
</line><line>Pavlova:
No. I am not <textEffects>Grimesby Roylott</textEffects>. My real name is <textEffects>Nikolina Pavlova</textEffects>. Everything you said was correct.
</line><line>Sholmes:
You absconded during one of your ballet company's performances in order to escape your homeland. Later that same night, you stole aboard this vessel.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Which couldn't have been easy. The Burya is a huge steamship with a vast crew. Could she really have snuck on board without being noticed?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
In order to obscure your true identity, you somewhat recklessly took the guise of an old gentleman. And you intended to sever all links with your past by severing your long hair.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yet to a woman, hair is no trifling matter. My personal recommendation is to leave well alone.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So...if it was just you, about to cut off your own hair... ...who was it that let out <textEffects>the scream</textEffects> we heard from outside the cabin?
</line><line>Sholmes:
That veritable tinkling of a bell? Why, none other than this young lady, naturally.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(More like a full set of pipes, if you ask me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pavlova:
I was so scared when I ran away in Shanghai. I was sure they would come looking for me. That's why I decided to... How do you say? Disgust myself? So no one would recognise me.
</line><line>Susato:
As a result, you transformed yourself into that questionable old man? I see...
</line><line>Pavlova:
I put on the fur hat and...fake beard? Then, just before you came in here, I saw in the newspaper. Right on the page...there was a picture of me. I was so frightened. I couldn't stop from screaming. I knew that if I didn't change my appearances completely, they would find me. So I decided to cut all my hair as fastly as possible. I picked up the scissors in my hand, and...
</line><line>Sholmes:
...At that precise moment, we walked in through the annoyingly unlocked cabin door.
</line><line>Susato:
......... Things happen like that sometimes, don't they?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Things do indeed happen like that from time to time.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Are those two even talking about the same thing?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
There's just one more thing I'd like to know... What exactly do you have inside your travelling case?
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... You were right. It is my <textEffects>dear friend</textEffects> inside. My only friend in the whole world. Please...don't tell anyone! If the captain finds out... If you say to any of the crew...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Your secret is safe with us, I assure you. But in return... ...you must tell us, in as much detail as you can muster, about the events of last night.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...Yes, alright. I will tell you.
</line><line>Susato:
Well, Mr Naruhodo...? Wasn't it something, Mr Sholmes's great deduction?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was certainly something, yes. I'm just not entirely sure what... But at least Miss Pavlova has agreed to tell us what she knows. That's incredible!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed! It IS incredible! Ah, and one more thing...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes? What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Observe your wrists.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My...?
</line><line>Susato:
Ah! Your hands...are cuffed again!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
WHAT?! But, but how...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
True to my word, I have restored your shackles.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Grrr... <textEffects>(When? And why?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
There is still a shadow of guilt cast over you, Mr Naruhodo. I'm sorry to say...it can't be helped at the moment.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Haah... <textEffects>(Can't it? Really?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Anyway, let's listen to what Miss Pavlova has to say. I can't go on not knowing... I have to find out what the 'speckled band' that Kazuma-sama wrote about in his diary really was!

Yes, please don't worry yourself, Mr Roylott.

GET OUT!!!

The passenger said, 'OUT'! Or you want me to throw you out?!

Mr Sholmes... ...you seemed to be examining something before we interrupted you.

Ah, yes. That. I was immersed in study of <textEffects>the ship's log</textEffects>, as penned by the stockily-built crewman who's usually on guard here.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, the ship's log.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And did you find out anything useful from it?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, after 2 a.m. this morning, the majority of the entries are <textEffects>blank</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which means that there was nothing to report. Nothing of note happened, so-
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are a student from the Land of the Rising Sun! You've been utterly blinded by it! Ah ha ha!

Sorry?

Your logic, my boys, is inverted.
</line><line>Susato:
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Observe the other pages, and all shall become clear. It would seem the same crewman oft stands sentry in this first-class passageway. And he has an almost religious practice of recording '<textEffects>Nothing to report</textEffects>' every half hour.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, he writes that in every thirty minutes?
</line><line>Susato:
Nothing to report...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely! Put simply, the seaman writes 'Nothing to report' when there is just that. And yet...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...The ship's log from last night is largely <textEffects>blank</textEffects>. He didn't even write 'Nothing to report'...
</line><line>Susato:
Do you mean...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes. There were circumstances afoot last night, which led to the seaman being absent from his post.
</line><line>Susato:
What kind of circumstances? What happened?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
That remains a mystery for now. But we can be sure something significant took place. So significant, that it caused the seaman to forget his regular habit of scribing 'Nothing to report' in the log. These are important details. I would stake my life on it! You must log the ship's log in your mental file!
</line><line><textEffects>The ship's log has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>

There is cell below deck. Throw him in! Tomorrow we dock in Hong Kong. Then we give you straight to police!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! A cell...?
</line><line>Susato:
Please, Inspector Hosonaga! Is there nothing you can do?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
This is a Russian vessel. I really have no jurisdiction here. After my last effort to appeal to the captain's good nature, I think I'm out of options.
</line><line>Susato:
This is terrible...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(This is a real crisis. I've got to find a solution! Immediately!)</textEffects>

<line>Ryunosuke:
What the...? What are you doing up there...? ...MR SHOLMES?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Naturally, I was analysing what a weight of twenty thousand roubles feels like on one's head. Have I not told you that as a detective, it is my business to know what other people do not? This isn't mere tomfoolery, my boy! Oh no no!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, well...why were you hanging from that hook before then?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Isn't it obvious? To properly assess the weight of the twenty thousand roubles, naturally. I wished to determine if it would bend that conceited-looking hook on the wall, so full of brag and bounce!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Agh, I never know whether to take this man seriously or not!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah, you again! The 'great detective'!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, Inspector! I confess I've been looking for you. I have something to report to you most urgently.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Well, you might try looking for me somewhere other than a hook on the wall next time.
</line><line>Strogenov:
What is to report? Speak!
</line><line>Sholmes:
An urgent report from a great detective can mean but one thing... Yes... The case of the curious murder that took place last night, here on this vessel, the Steamship Burya... ...has been <textEffects>solved</textEffects>! By me, naturally.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
</line><line>Susato:
Really?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, I have eliminated all other possibilities. No other explanations exist! So, allow me to illuminate all your minds! For I am about to reveal my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Hah! You have solved it? Even hedgehog understands this case! We all knew who was responsible for killing student boy this morning, when we found kriminal in wardrobe! It is this stowaway! And he has handcuffs to prove it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I didn't do it!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
The trouble is, there doesn't appear to be anyone else who could have killed the victim. Because, as everyone knows, the cabin door was bolted shut from the inside. That means the culprit must be someone who was inside the cabin.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, it's what's called <textEffects>a locked room mystery</textEffects> in detective stories.
</line><line>Strogenov:
Da! Locked room! That is point!
</line><line>Pavlova:
The room...was locked...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well I can't deny that. There's no way the bolt could have been drawn across from outside the cabin.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
You are all quite mistaken. The cabin next door is not a so-called 'locked room' at all.
</line><line>Susato:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh yes. There is another <textEffects>entrance</textEffects>. <textEffects>An entrance</textEffects> used last night by the culprit in order to gain access to the cabin despite the bolted door.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What <textEffects>other entrance</textEffects>? We never discovered one!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why, it gapes open-mouthed at you even as we speak! ...<textEffects>The ventilator</textEffects>, man!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>The ventilator</textEffects>?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Gah ha ha ha hah! You think this is funny?! I cannot even put my arm through that hole!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That's...because your arms are as thick as tree trunks.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
You're suggesting that the culprit entered and left the victim's cabin through that tiny opening? It's not possible!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, but it is. And last night, the victim even <textEffects>witnessed</textEffects> the intruder in the act of passing through the ventilator.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes, do you mean...? Are you referring to the words Kazuma-sama wrote in his diary? '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint <textEffects>whistling</textEffects> sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of <textEffects>speckled band</textEffects> is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely, my dear madam.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But what does it mean? What is this 'speckled band'?
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>The answer</textEffects> to that particular conundrum... is in this very cabin.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes? What are you doing?
</line><line>Sholmes:
There is a distinct element of danger. But fear not; I am ready! What I am about to expose for you all to see will shock you to your cores! Behold!
</line>
<center>KYAAAAAAGH!AAAAAAGH! Wha-What the...?</center>
<line>
Strogenov:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
Allow me to introduce you all... ...to the band! <textEffects>The speckled band</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>A snake</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indubitably.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Erm, Mr Sholmes... Just...one thing...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Pray, what troubles you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, that snake...isn't really '<textEffects>speckled</textEffects>', is it? It looks more...<textEffects>stripy</textEffects>...wouldn't you say?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, you're right. I think in this case, you'd have to call it... ...<textEffects>the striped band</textEffects>...wouldn't you?
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... Heh heh heh... You both see, and observe. With distinction! However... ...do you not think that is precisely <textEffects>the trap</textEffects> into which the culprit wishes you to fall?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh my goodness, really? It's, it's a trap?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(How exactly...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
I think perhaps it is time I explained the intricacies of my train of thought. Are you ready...Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
I'm sorry for the young man who died. But that is all. His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!
</line><line>Sholmes:
There are two conclusions I have drawn from the facts. Number one... Last night, your 'friend' infiltrated the victim's cabin!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And number two... That same <textEffects>friend</textEffects> was responsible for the victim losing his life!
</line><line>Pavlova:
No...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(She's turned as white as a bowl of rice again... Sholmes must be right! He's <span style="color:#E16935">hit the nail on the head</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
This young woman's 'friend'...? Killed Mr Asogi...?
</line><line>Strogenov:
.........! .........? .........!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It looks like he can't speak with that snake coiled around his head.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
I would advise as little moment as possible, Seaman. You wouldn't want the fangs of that long friend in your neck. So, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his '<textEffects>Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</textEffects>'!

<b>The Great Deduction</b>The game is afoot!</center>
<line><b>Topic 1</b>
Intruder's Identity
</line><line>Sholmes:
Miss Pavlova, moments ago you claimed the following: 'His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!' Yet you cannot deceive yourself! Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your <textEffects><b>aching heart</b></textEffects> smarts with pain! And it is that very pain...that <textEffects>evidences</textEffects> your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the '<textEffects>friend</textEffects>' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale <textEffects>glance</textEffects>. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the <textEffects><b>writhing serpent</b></textEffects> we see before us! And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of '<textEffects>a speckled band</textEffects>'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
</line><line>Pavlova:
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the <textEffects><b>snake's sloughed skin</b></textEffects>! Evidently, after the subtle and horrible crime, this most deadly friend of yours... ...<textEffects>shed its original skin</textEffects>. No?
</line><line>Pavlova:
I, I don't know what you are talking about!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Last night, through the ventilator visible in this cabin, your then speckled friend slithered next door. Using the bell cord on the other side as a bridge, the serpent silently descended into the victim's quarters. In the dim light, it appeared to the young gentleman who was about to lose his life as a speckled band.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
In summary, the nature of this '<textEffects>friend</textEffects>' of yours, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a rare breed of snake whose markings change each time it sloughs its skin! A snake so dreadful, we can only imagine it would be found in the deepest depths of India.
</line><line><b>Topic 1</b>

<b>Topic 2</b>
How Mr Asogi Died
</line><line>Sholmes:
Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a <textEffects><b>terrible venom</b></textEffects>! Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no! Could there be...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes! An examination of the <textEffects><b>deceased's body</b></textEffects> will prove the cause of death conclusively! The almost - but not quite - imperceptible puncture wounds left by <textEffects>the venomous fangs</textEffects> will seal the truth. Yes, <textEffects>the vestiges</textEffects> of the snakebite delivered by your terrifying friend.
</line><line>Pavlova:
This, this makes no sense!
</line><line>Sholmes:
There is no point feigning ignorance, Miss Pavlova. ...After the incident, you endeavoured to hide everything, didn't you? But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <textEffects><b>travelling case</b></textEffects>! When we first met in this cabin, it came to my attention that your case moved periodically. Your serpent assassin was restless inside, no doubt.
</line><line>Pavlova:
You, you don't...
</line><line>Sholmes:
It is telling that the victim made note of a low <textEffects>whistling</textEffects> sound that he heard minutes before his end. That was your <textEffects>signal</textEffects>, was it not? The sound you had used to train your serpent friend.
</line><line>Pavlova:
To...train...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed, you'd put the serpent through this ventilator and wait. After a period, you'd summon it back with a whistle. You couldn't know if the animal had done its duty, so you would listen for signs of life next door. If the victim appeared not to have been dispatched, you'd release the snake once more. Do you deny this snake has undergone such training?
</line><line>Pavlova:
It's not true!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Having slithered through the ventilator and down the bell cord, the creature needed only to sink its fangs in once... ...and its venom would course through the victim's veins, ending his existence forever. That is <textEffects>the true nature</textEffects> of <textEffects>the speckled band</textEffects> that took the poor young man's life! There can be no doubt! My logic is infallible!

Death by a venomous snake's bite
</line><line>Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's <textEffects>great deduction</textEffects> of the speckled band!
</line>
<hr />
<center>.........</center>
<line>
Sholmes:
Miss Pavlova has trained her pet snake as <textEffects>a killing machine</textEffects>. There on the floor, you will observe a saucer of milk. The promise of food is the key to training any creature.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In-Incredible! You've <textEffects>solved</textEffects> the mystery!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Amazing! Your <textEffects>great deduction</textEffects> really lives up to its name! I see now why Herlock Sholmes has become such a household name!
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear man... It was nothing remarkable. As the Russians say, 'I could have done it with one left hand.'
</line><line>Susato:
......... Um... Could I venture an opinion, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
But of course. What's on your mind?
</line><line>Susato:
It's just, about your deductions before... Some things don't quite make sense to me.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I welcome questions as to my method. And will answer both loudly and proudly!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh. Well, good. First of all... ...snakes are egg-laying creatures. Part of the <textEffects>reptile</textEffects> family.
</line><line>Sholmes:
You are well informed, madam.
</line><line>Susato:
And reptiles, um...<textEffects>don't drink</textEffects> milk.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah.
</line><line>Susato:
It's really only mammals that like to drink milk, you see. So...I'm not sure it would be possible to train a snake using milk as a reward.
</line><line>Sholmes:
No matter! No doubt Miss Pavlova used some other treat to encourage her pet to do her bidding. Milk was merely an example. The logic holds.
</line><line>Susato:
Well, there is something else. Snakes have no <textEffects>ears</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, so I'm not sure it would really be possible to signal to a snake by whistling...
</line><line>Sholmes:
But madam! What of the tales from Arabia? Have you not heard of the snakes that dance to the sounds of a flute?
</line><line>Susato:
I think perhaps the performers play their music in time with the snakes' natural movements...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh. I see. No hands, no feet, no EARS?! These creatures are so inept as to be practically useless!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Don't take it out on the snakes, Mr Sholmes!
</line><line>Susato:
Um...there is one other thing....
</line><line>Sholmes:
You have more?!
</line><line>Susato:
Snakes use the scales on their bellies to propel themselves. So...I'm not really sure that a snake could manage to climb up a flat bell cord like the ones in these cabins.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Then it should try harder!
</line><line>Susato:
Please, don't be angry with me, Mr Sholmes. The point is... ...even if the snake had gone through the ventilator to the next-door cabin, it couldn't have come back without help. What I'm trying to say... ...is that there are a number of reasons why it's <textEffects>difficult</textEffects> to imagine the snake could have had a part in this.
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
I think... ...we need to step in and help again, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh no, you don't mean...?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes. We need to modify Mr Sholmes's latest deductions, and turn them into the great ones they ought to be!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I had a feeling that was coming.)</textEffects> Alright...let's give it a try!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Just what I was waiting for, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes... Right!
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, cast your eyes down to your wrists again.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? You've done it again!
</line><line>Susato:
Your handcuffs are gone!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Where did they go?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Fear not. I shall see they're restored after our work is done.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I really wish you'd leave them off...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
She does have a pained expression on her face.

Yes, that's true. She looks as though Kazuma-sama's death is weighing heavily on her mind.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But you're not sure Mr Sholmes has read her quite correctly, is that it? <textEffects>(Could there be some other way to <span style="color:#E16935">interpret</textEffects> her expression, then?)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
Let's take a moment... ...and <textEffects>really look</textEffects> very closely at Miss Pavlova.
</line>




<line>
</line>



<line>Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your <textEffects><b>aching heart</b></textEffects> smarts with pain! 
</line><line>Susato:
If that expression on her face is to be believed...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...She really is feeling genuine pain. <textEffects>(But what's really the cause of it...?)</textEffects>

Let's have another good look at her, and see if we can make sense of it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, when you recall those horrid events, that <textEffects><b>claw scratch</b></textEffects> smarts with pain!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed! And simple observation reveals...that the wound is fresh.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, did you in fact receive that scratch... ...sometime last night?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah! ......... When I think about the young man who died next door, I feel so sad. And when I am sad...the pain from this wound is worse.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And it is that very pain...that <textEffects>evidences</textEffects> your inextricable link to the victim's death.

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It seems likely that <textEffects>the scratch mark</textEffects> on the back of Miss Pavlova's hand... ...was made by this 'friend' of hers, doesn't it? Except... ...snakes don't have claws, do they?
</line><line>Susato:
No, they don't. They don't even have hands or feet on which claws might grow.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well then... ...if that snake isn't her pet, what is? What's <textEffects>the true identity</textEffects> of this friend of hers?
</line><line>Susato:
We should follow her gaze, Naruhodo-san. That's where we'll find the answer!

<line>Without doubt, your 'friend' is the <textEffects><b>writhing serpent</b></textEffects> we see before us!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
We can be reasonably sure that Miss Pavlova's furtive glance was aimed at her friend.
</line><line>Susato:
And that same friend is probably responsible for the scratch on the back of her hand. We also know that whatever it is, this friend must be small enough to pass through the ventilator.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That really ought to narrow it down. <textEffects>(Let me scout around again in the direction she looked.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Without doubt, your 'friend' is the <textEffects><b>little kitten</b></textEffects> we see before us!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes! <textEffects>The scratch</textEffects> on the back of your hand makes that abundantly clear.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The whereabouts of this black kitten isn't clear. But what is clear... ...is that you brought the animal with you when you ran away, didn't you?
</line><line>Pavlova:
AAAGH! ......... Darka is my best friend. I couldn't leave her behind.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, Darka would appear to be a Russian Blue. And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
</line><line>Pavlova:
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the <textEffects><b>snake's sloughed skin</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
Did you see that? She just took something out of her pocket and hid it behind her back!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If she'd just left it in her pocket, no one would ever have known.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, <textEffects>ploys</textEffects> like that are Mr Sholmes's speciality! He's ever so cleverly forced her to reveal something!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I thought deduction was his speciality. ...Or maybe making me believe that was a ploy, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Anyway... ...I find it hard to believe that's the skin of a snake.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(In which case... ...just what is Miss Pavlova hiding behind her back?)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
</line>



<line>Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the <textEffects><b>snake's sloughed skin</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What exactly is Miss Pavlova trying to hide, I wonder?
</line><line>Susato:
I don't think there's any room for doubt.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, in a sense, there isn't. She's clearly concealing whatever it is behind her back.
</line><line>Susato:
The question we need to ask is whether it really is the shed skin of a snake or not.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I should probably look at it in more detail...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! The thing you are trying - but failing - to conceal, is, um...a <textEffects><b>cat's toy</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely! And <textEffects>the true nature</textEffects> of the now infamous <textEffects>speckled band</textEffects>!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And it was this toy that you dangled through the ventilator. You waved it around, I presume? Naturally, the victim could not fail to notice it.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But why? For what reason?
</line><line>Sholmes:
My dear boy, there can be only one answer to that. After her <textEffects>feline friend</textEffects> disappeared through the ventilator into the neighbouring cabin... ...Miss Pavlova attempted to use the speckled cat's toy to incite the creature to <textEffects>return</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah...
</line><line>Sholmes:
In summary, the nature of this '<textEffects>friend</textEffects>' of Miss Pavlova's, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a blithesome Russian Blue breed of cat by the name of Darka!
</line><line>Pavlova:
KYAAAAAAGH!!!
</line><line>Sholmes:
A truly troublesome feline, young Darka is proving to be. She must be caged once found. You will forgive us for borrowing the photograph of your pet, Miss Pavlova.
</line><line><textEffects>The photograph of Miss Pavlova and Darka has been entered into the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Pavlova:
...It was after I gave her her food last night. That's when it happened. She scratched the back of my hand, and then ran up <textEffects>the bell cord</textEffects>. Before I could do anything, she had disappeared... through <textEffects>the ventilator</textEffects>. Darka... She is so naughty...

That's right. But Mr Sholmes seems to be unaware of one very important detail. <textEffects>(Kazuma wasn't <span style="color:#E16935">poisoned</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, it would seem so. Let's give him the information he's missing now!
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by the <textEffects><b>post-mortem report</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, yes! I knew it was one or the other!
</line><line>Pavlova:
...! His neck was...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. The breaking of the cervical vertebrae is fatal. Only that goliath would be strong enough to survive that!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov isn't some immortal freak, you know...
</line><line>Sholmes:
The jury is out. Anyway, we have on good authority that the victim's neck was broken. Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no! Could there be...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes! An examination of the <textEffects><b>deceased's body</b></textEffects> will prove the cause of death conclusively!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Kazuma died because his neck was broken. In other words, he was probably struck by something... or someone.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, that's a distinct possibility. As of yet, no weapon has been found, though.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Presumably Darka didn't silently creep up behind Kazuma and deal him a fatal blow...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
I suppose... ...it's possible that he had <textEffects>a fall</textEffects> and hit the ground awkwardly. It could have been a terrible act of misfortune that he broke his neck completely by accident.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. <textEffects>(A bad <span style="color:#E16935">fall</textEffects> could explain it...)</span>
</line><line>Susato:
It's rather hard to believe of Kazuma-sama, though. He wasn't a clumsy man.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm... Well, we need to fix this deduction somehow. Is there anything from the scene that could explain what happened?
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! An examination of the <textEffects><b>mark on the floor</b></textEffects> will prove the cause of death conclusively!
</line><line>Sholmes:
This particular mark, so prominently visible next to the victim's body, is a deposit of <textEffects>shoe polish</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Shoe polish?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed. Positively identified by a little analysis device I constructed, which I carry now as a matter of course. Beeswax, tallow and dye were my results. The undeniable ingredients of shoe polish.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And the colour of the polish is a perfect match to the colour of Mr Asogi's <textEffects>laced leather shoes</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Looking at this mark, it's not hard to imagine what happened. For some reason... ...Mr Asogi must have caught his foot at that point on the floor and <textEffects>tripped</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Please no...
</line><line>Sholmes:
And, by a dreadful turn of misfortune, caught his neck against some immovable object as he fell to the floor. Suffering a fatal blow to the spine, the victim's vertebrae shattered, and in that instant...he lost his life.
</line><line>Pavlova:
NOOOOOOOOO!!! ......... I don't know... I don't know anything about this!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Is that really true, Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What about <textEffects>the evidence</textEffects> left at the scene where Mr Asogi lost his life?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, the facts are as clear as day to me! You did all you could to conceal the incriminating evidence. But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <textEffects><b>travelling case</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama merely tripped over and...and now he's no more? It can't be true! I refuse to accept it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.
</line><line>Susato:
But...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And if this part of Mr Sholmes's deduction is right... ...Miss Pavlova is trying to hide some <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that would prove it. Here in this cabin...somewhere in the direction that she just cast her eyes.
</line><line>Susato:
Where, I wonder?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Let's have a good look around. The answer must be here somewhere!
</line>



<line>
</line>




<line>That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <textEffects><b>travelling case</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
I still can't bring myself to believe it. It just seems so unlike Kazuma-sama to stumble carelessly and then...fall to his death.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.
</line><line>Susato:
But...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I have a feeling there's something here in this cabin that links Miss Pavlova to that mark. And I suspect we'll find it in the direction that she guiltily cast her eyes before!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <textEffects><b>wastepaper basket</b></textEffects>!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Here we have a fragment of some intricate glass object, it would seem. ...One that has a familiar air, in fact.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Precisely! We found <textEffects>another piece of broken glass</textEffects> on the floor in Mr Asogi's cabin. And, as you can see...the two pieces fit together perfectly!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no...
</line><line>Sholmes:
So, Miss Pavlova, shall we consider what this tells us? Why would it be, that part of this glass object, which was evidently broken at the scene of the victim's death... ...should be found in the wastepaper basket in your cabin?
</line><line>Pavlova:
KYAAAAAAAAAH!!!
</line><line>Sholmes:
You're well acquainted with this glass bell, are you not?
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... I... I don't...
</line><line>Sholmes:
'I don't know' in that hushed Russian accent of yours won't save you this time, dear girl. ...Why? Because we have conclusive <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> linking you to the bell in question.
</line><line>Pavlova:
What?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Take it away, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm... Yes... <textEffects>The evidence linking Miss Pavlova and the little glass bell... That would be...</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
If you look at this photograph, you can clearly see... ...hanging from Darka's collar... ...the very glass bell in question!
</line><line>Pavlova:
I...
</line><line>Sholmes:
The truth has caught up with you, Miss Pavlova. The young man who lost his life last night did so after a truly inauspicious fall.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And the cause of that fateful stumble?
</line><line>Your absent feline friend...Darka!
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... ......... I couldn't... I couldn't tell anyone... ...I'm...sorry...

<center><textEffects><b>Solved</b></textEffects>

</line>
<b>Deduction Complete</b>Elementary!</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Why don't you tell us now, Miss Pavlova? Tell us exactly what happened last night.
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... It was...a little after one in the morning. It was so late, but I hadn't had time to feed Darka. So I gave her some food. And then, all of a sudden, she scratched me and jumped out of my hands.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
People do say that cats become very anxious and nervous in new environments.
</line><line>Pavlova:
She was so fast. She disappeared through the ventilator before I could stop her.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And that is how you <textEffects>acquired the rather nasty wound</textEffects> on the back of your hand, I take it?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Yes. And I had read the, um...rules on the wall. I knew that I was not allowed Darka with me.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, modern science suggests that animals can carry infectious diseases. It's a precaution really.
</line><line>Pavlova:
So I listened and listened, trying to hear if there was some noise in the next cabin. It was very quiet. I was sure, if someone was there, he must be sleeping.
</line><line>Sholmes:
So at that point, you thought it safe to try to lure the kitten back again? By dangling the end of the toy through the ventilator and into the adjourning cabin.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Darka always loves this toy. But it didn't work. Nothing worked. I tried using her favourite toy, I tried whistling to her softly, but nothing... She didn't return.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So the '<span style="color:#E16935">faint whistling</textEffects>' sound Kazuma wrote about in his diary was Miss Pavlova, trying to <textEffects>retrieve her pet</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Cats have a propensity to remain hidden in the shadows when frightened.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Yes. So there was nothing else I could do. I just had to wait until she had calmed down. But then...
</line>
<hr />
<center>MIAOOOOOW!
*Thud*</center>
<hr />
<line>Pavlova:
I, I nearly passed out with shock. I heard her cry out, and then... Oh, it was such a dreadful bang! Then afterwards, nothing. It was totally silent.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Kazuma was...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... From the appearance of the brown mark on the floor... ...it seems likely that what you heard was the victim stepping on the glass <textEffects>bell</textEffects> and tripping up. The SS Burya is a large vessel, but even she can pitch and roll violently without warning. If Mr Asogi was already off balance as a result of the ship lurching when the kitten got under his feet... ...the combination of unfortunate factors could easily have caused him to <textEffects>fall over</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But what became of the kitten afterwards?
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... In the end, I managed to get her to come back through the ventilator.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yet Darka is nowhere to be seen.
</line><line>Pavlova:
I...must have forgotten to lock my case. And now she's disappeared again.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Gracious, that cat is as insufferably restless as I am!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well, he knows something about himself, at least...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pavlova:
When I woke this morning, I heard that a young man in the cabin next to mine had died. But I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone what had happened. I was too scared. Scared that they would send me back.
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Hold on a minute... What about <textEffects>the snake</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
You're right! Where is it?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If the snake isn't your friend, Miss Pavlova, then whose is it, and where did it come from? What on earth is such a dangerous creature doing on board this ship?!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Oh. I didn't say? Snake is my friend. His name is <textEffects>Pirozhko</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm...?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Wha...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
WHAAAT?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That snake belongs to you?
</line><line>Strogenov:
He escaped from cage when emergency alarm sounded. I was looking for him. I did not expect to find him in here!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, how did that snake get into this cabin?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But... ...animals are not permitted on board!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Hah! We are at sea for ONE YEAR! You want to be so long without close friend? Without someone who understands?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(...Couldn't you find someone a little more...human who understands you better?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
But my dear burly fellow... ...a gargantuan venomous snake?! Surely you can appreciate the danger you're putting everyone in?
</line><line>Strogenov:
No venom.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Pirozhko does not have venom. He is harmless! Very long, but very gentle! He is adorable, like Granny!
</line><line>Sholmes:
It's...venomless?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Yes. Now he is hungry, so he is in bad mood. But once I feed him, you will see big smile!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And...you feed him...what? Milk, I suppose?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Hah! Like they say they milk chickens? ...Ridiculous! Snakes that drink milk are only in stupid stories! Pirozhko eats mouses! Big, fat, round mouses!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah... Oh, so... ...is that what <textEffects>the mousetrap</textEffects> in the passageway out there is for?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Of course. How else can I catch my friend's favourite food?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Nothing says 'top of the food chain' like the look in their eyes right now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... It refuses to drink milk, it can't hear a whistle, it can't climb up a bell cord and it's not even venomous... How the deuce did <textEffects>something so inept</textEffects> land a starring role?!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Is not my fault! I do not make up stories! My Pirozhko is nothing to do with this incident!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(So that's what happened... That's the truth behind my best friend's tragic death...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
......... Miss Pavlova...
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
I understand the difficult situation you've found yourself in. And I do sympathise. But please remember this: A young man lost his life. If you're going to attempt to cover up your <textEffects>guilt</textEffects> with lies, then... ...then no matter what the circumstances, I cannot forgive you!
</line><line>Pavlova:
But...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What are you talking about, Miss Mikotoba? What lies? Miss Pavlova just confessed everything! It was just a series of unfortunate events. <textEffects>An accident</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
I'm no great detective like Mr Sholmes. I don't have a gift for knowing the truth. But even I can see...<textEffects>that was not the truth</textEffects>! Don't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... <textEffects>(To be perfectly honest, yes. There's <span style="color:#E16935">a discrepancy</textEffects> in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure of it. I just can't quite put my finger on it.)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... I confess... ...I was intending to let Scotland Yard deal with any outstanding issues on this matter.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I am only present here for a very specific reason. The truth is, you, Mr Naruhodo, are simply <textEffects>a distraction</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A distraction?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I do hope you've not been finding your <textEffects>shackles</textEffects> too uncomfortable.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! <textEffects>(Not again! When did he do that?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Especially as they're on your wrists as a result of my intervention. I was rather hoping I could resolve matters before we made our next port call.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You were, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, but I overlooked one important detail. The deceased young man was a very close <textEffects>companion</textEffects> of yours... ...was he not?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Yes. Kazuma was my closest friend. I owed him my freedom, even.
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
In that case, we must follow this to its conclusion. No further <textEffects>distractions</textEffects>. You must uncover the REAL truth here, Mr Naruhodo!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes... Whatever that may be... <textEffects>(The key to this is <span style="color:#E16935">the discrepancy</textEffects> in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure. If I can <textEffects>chase that down</textEffects>, maybe the truth will become clear. The truth about how you really died. About how that <textEffects>scene</textEffects> in your cabin really came to be...!)</span> Alright. I'll see what I can do.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Excellent.
</line><line>Susato:
Thank you, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
So then, shall we begin?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
What we should ponder first... ...is <textEffects>the victim</textEffects> who lost his life in a cabin that was bolted shut from the inside. Was this truly an unfortunate <textEffects>accident</textEffects>? Or was it in fact no <textEffects>accident</textEffects> at all? That is what we must establish in the first instance.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But we've already established it, haven't we? The man tripped over the kitten that had climbed into his cabin via the ventilator. Tragic, yes. But still <textEffects>an accident</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wait! Let's just take a step back. It doesn't make sense if that's really what happened, does it?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I'm going to have to ask you to spell it out for me, I'm afraid.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects> between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.)</span> <textEffects>The evidence</textEffects> is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable! His death couldn't possibly have been a mere <textEffects>accident</textEffects>!
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
R-Really?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Let us show our hand, Mr Naruhodo! Time to present <textEffects>the evidence</textEffects>! <textEffects>The evidence that proves unequivocally that the victim's death was no mere accident!</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
This! This <textEffects>piece of broken glass</textEffects> next to the mark on the floor!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But that's the glass <textEffects>bell</textEffects> the kitten had around its neck. We already know all about that. It was broken in half when the victim <textEffects>tripped</textEffects> over the cat and fell. So we already have a satisfactory explanation. Where's the flaw in that logic?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, there is a very big flaw. <textEffects>A fatal flaw</textEffects>!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
If that's really what happened... ...then how did one half of <textEffects>the bell</textEffects> end up back here in <textEffects>this cabin</textEffects>?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah!
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, remember that we found the other half of the glass bell in that <textEffects>wastepaper basket</textEffects>. Would you care to explain that...Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no...
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Both these pieces of evidence clearly point to the same conclusion..."
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>


<line>Ryunosuke:
The truth is clearly <textEffects>recorded</textEffects> in this photographic print! There's <textEffects>no way</textEffects> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That script... It's <textEffects>Russian</textEffects>, isn't it?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed it is. The word written means '<textEffects>wardrobe</textEffects>'.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. <textEffects>Japanese</textEffects> in this case.
</line><line>Pavlova:
But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(That doesn't seem likely.)</textEffects> That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Sorry? What do you mean?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Exactly what I said before: There is <textEffects>no way</textEffects> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...<textEffects>Instant death</textEffects>.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........!
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Both these pieces of evidence clearly point to the same conclusion..."

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Ryunosuke:
Both these pieces of <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> clearly point to the same conclusion... That when Mr Asogi died last night in his cabin... ...there was <textEffects>someone else</textEffects> in the room!
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And that same person...deliberately <textEffects>arranged the scene</textEffects> to disguise the truth... ...in order to cover up their own <textEffects>guilt</textEffects>!

Yes, there was someone else <textEffects>present</textEffects> in Mr Asogi's-

You are wasting time!
</line><line>Strogenov:
<textEffects>Someone else</textEffects> was there? Da! Of course! We know this!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Bulkhead was bolted shut from inside. There was <textEffects>no way in or out</textEffects>!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Oh yes...
</line><line>Strogenov:
And only other person in cabin when young student died...was <textEffects>you</textEffects>!

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's true, I was in the cabin when it happened.
</line><line>Sholmes:
You were <textEffects>shut inside the cabin's wardrobe</textEffects>, to be precise about the details.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But I don't know Russian! There's no way I would have left that message!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Not '<textEffects>would have</textEffects>'... There's no way you <textEffects>could have</textEffects> left that message...to be precise about the details.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Would you mind?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Forgive me, my dear fellow!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
As I was saying... The person in question wrote the word '<textEffects>wardrobe</textEffects>' in Russian on the floor... ...in an attempt to incriminate me for the crime, even though I had been asleep in there the entire time.
</line><line>Susato:
And then, the same person picked up the broken glass <textEffects>bell</textEffects> that had fallen to the floor... ...for fear of it becoming <textEffects>evidence</textEffects> that would show how Mr Asogi really died.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But why wouldn't this person have taken all the pieces of the bell away? Leaving <textEffects>half</textEffects> behind was always going to raise questions.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, well, um...
</line><line>Sholmes:
It was past <textEffects>one o'clock in the early hours</textEffects> of the morning. The cabin would have been quite <textEffects>dark</textEffects>. The single, small lamp suspended from the ceiling would barely have cast any light onto the floor there. Little wonder then, that the culprit <textEffects>failed to notice</textEffects> a fragment of the tiny item.
</line><line>Pavlova:
You all suspect me...don't you?

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
S-Seaman Strogenov!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Nina is woman of sea! She is daughter of strong sailor. Two years ago, they noticed her dancing skills and she went away to join ballet company. But before...she was dancer on this ship. A member of ship's band. You do not accuse ship's angel of being kriminal!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, so that's it...
</line><line>Strogenov:
You say that when young student died, Nina <textEffects>was there</textEffects> in his cabin. But that is not possible! I give my tooth!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm, well... This is all most interesting... And why would you 'give your tooth', pray? How can you be so sure?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Hmph! You are <textEffects>great detective</textEffects>! You should know! Look truth in eyes! Cabin bulkhead was bolted shut <textEffects>from inside</textEffects>! Nobody could go into cabin. Not Nina, not anyone! Or you want to tell me that killer can walk through locked doors? ...Nyet! It's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects>!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh! <textEffects>(He's right...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
But wait! I've read about this in detective stories. People often tie thread around door latches so they can open and close them from the outside!
</line><line>Strogenov:
<textEffects>Thread</textEffects>? Are you stupid? These bulkheads are not barn doors!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Certainly not. These are watertight doors, as one would expect to find on any modern steamship. Constructed of heavy steel, with not a gap in sight. No threads or needles or magnets could have been used.
</line><line>Susato:
No... No, of course not. I thought so, too. But Mr Naruhodo suggested it earlier, so...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Susato-san! How could you shift it onto me like that?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
So Seaman Strogenov has a valid point. The cabin door couldn't have been bolted shut from the outside.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Not necessarily...
</line><line>Strogenov:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I put it to you that I could bolt this cabin door... ...without laying a finger on it.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And in this very cabin... ...we can see <textEffects>the traces</textEffects> of the method I have in mind having been used before!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I don't believe it!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, Mr Naruhodo? I believe you know what I mean, don't you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(A way to shut the bolt of the cabin door from <span style="color:#E16935">the outside</textEffects>?)</span> One way does spring to mind, yes.
</line><line>Susato:
Do you really know what Mr Sholmes means, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. And so should you. Because we've <textEffects>seen</textEffects> it happen!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed we have! So, would you care to do the honours, Mr Naruhodo? <textEffects>Point out the telling signs of the method that was used to slide the cabin door bolt across from the outside!</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Look at <textEffects>the bookcase</textEffects> there. See how all the books and things on it have toppled over?
</line><line>Susato:
That must have happened when the ship made its <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects> before.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, that's right. It's a very powerful vessel, after all. When the engines are thrown into reverse, a violent jolt goes across the entire ship. Any small objects that aren't fastened down are bound to fall over.
</line><line>Susato:
I believe... Yes, it's what's known as the force of '<textEffects>inertia</textEffects>' acting on the objects.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Is there nothing Susato-san doesn't know...?! Or that isn't in her book, at least?)</textEffects> Well, whatever it's called, the same force that pushed over those books on the bookcase... ...also made something else in this cabin <textEffects>move</textEffects>. <textEffects>The bolt</textEffects> on the cabin door.
</line><line>Susato:
Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It was very obvious just after <textEffects>the emergency stop</textEffects> that the ship made earlier. We had come into this cabin not long before, and we hadn't bolted the door. But then...
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, that sounds like...
</line><line>Susato:
...Inspector Hosonaga.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Susato:
Oh yes! That's it! When the ship stopped suddenly, the bolt flew across and locked the door!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's made of metal, but it's small and light enough to be moved by the ship's sudden change of speed. ...Or the force of '<textEffects>ineptia</textEffects>', if you want to call it that.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Are, are you trying to say that last night... After Mr Asogi was killed... ...the SS Burya made another <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
When I woke up this morning and looked around the cabin, I thought it looked a little odd. All the books on the shelves had toppled over. And all the ornaments. It was almost as if someone had run their hand across the shelves and deliberately knocked everything over.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, I remember that! And I stood them all up again, didn't I?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Then when we came into this cabin, we were surprised to see the same thing in here. All the books and everything had toppled over, just like in Mr Asogi's cabin.
</line><line>Susato:
...Oh my!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you have anything to say about this, Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Strogenov:
Are you out of your mind? You say Burya made <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
It does seem a little far-fetched. How could that possibly have happened? Unless you're saying that the culprit is actually someone from the engine room?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh, it is simple enough.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Hm?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Are you forgetting <textEffects>the button</textEffects> in the passageway outside, used to trigger <textEffects>the emergency alarm</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh yes, of course... There was a notice, wasn't there? Telling you only to press the button in times of emergency.
</line><line>Sholmes:
On dark nights when the fog is dense, the captain cannot afford to rely on the eyes of his lookout alone. Hence the placement of a number of <textEffects>buttons</textEffects> around the vessel to allow any crewman to raise the alarm. The sort of button one is almost compelled to press to satisfy one's curiosity...
</line><line>Strogenov:
......... Wait! It, it was you?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
When <textEffects>the button</textEffects> is pressed, two things happen in the interests of safety: The emergency alarm bell rings, and the vessel comes to a complete stop. ...As indeed it did a little earlier today.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
.........
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes... Surely it wasn't you who...
</line><line>Sholmes:
As I always say, <textEffects>a button</textEffects> has but one purpose in life. To be <textEffects>pressed</textEffects>! Whatever the occasion!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He sounds almost proud of himself!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Strogenov:
How dare you mess with ship?! I report you to captain! You are in much trouble now!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Now now, I'm sure all that can wait until later. Let us not overlook the fact that we have now learnt a valuable lesson. When the vessel makes <textEffects>an emergency stop</textEffects>, the bolts on the cabin doors slide closed. So...what we must now consider...
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, it all comes down to one thing now. Last night, <textEffects>after</textEffects> what happened to Mr Asogi... ...did this ship make <textEffects>an emergency stop</textEffects>...or did it not?
</line><line>Strogenov:
You are idiots! Burya is huge ship with many passengers. If we make <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects>, even in middle of night... ...there would be <textEffects>chaos</textEffects> everywhere!
</line><line>Sholmes:
What are your thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Well... ...it's certainly possible that some kind of <textEffects>emergency</textEffects> happened last night. We have evidence to support that idea.
</line><line>Susato:
Really?! What <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Fascinating! Do show us, my good man! <textEffects>What evidence promotes the theory that some emergency gripped this vessel last night?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov... ...it's your duty to patrol the first-class area of the ship, isn't that right?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Da! That is correct. ...Why?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
And <textEffects>the ship's log</textEffects> here... This would be where you <textEffects>record</textEffects> the details of your duties?
</line><line>Strogenov:
What are you doing with that?! That is mine!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, you rather carelessly <textEffects>left it</textEffects> atop the little makeshift bureau in the passageway out there. But as responsible passengers, we took it into our care with a mind to return it to you later.
</line><line>Strogenov:
I <textEffects>left it</textEffects> there <textEffects>on purpose</textEffects>! That is where I put it always!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The point is, looking at what you usually <textEffects>record</textEffects>... ...it's clear that under normal circumstances, you write the phrase '<textEffects>Nothing to report</textEffects>' every thirty minutes. But from two o'clock last night until first light this morning...nothing was <textEffects>recorded</textEffects> at all.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Nothing <textEffects>recorded</textEffects> in the log?!
</line><line>Strogenov:
That is... Da! Because nothing happened!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But if nothing happened, you would normally write '<textEffects>Nothing to report</textEffects>', wouldn't you?
</line><line>Strogenov:
...*Gulp*
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed so. Which tells us that shortly after 2 a.m... ...<textEffects>something</textEffects> happened here aboard the SS Burya.
</line><line>Strogenov:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Something sufficiently significant to make you forget to fill in <textEffects>the ship's log</textEffects>, in fact.
</line><line>Susato:
Are you suggesting... ...that the ship really did make <textEffects>an emergency stop</textEffects> in the middle of the night?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Stop talking RUBBISH!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... If I'm perfectly honest... ...I find that a little hard to believe myself.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh? Why?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Well, because if something as major as <textEffects>an emergency stop</textEffects> really had happened... ...surely all of us would have noticed?
</line><line>Susato:
That's very true. Thanks to <textEffects>the emergency stop</textEffects> we experienced earlier, we all know what it feels like now. The ship <textEffects>lurched</textEffects> so violently. And <textEffects>the alarm bell</textEffects> was so loud... I can't imagine that anybody would sleep through that, even if it happened in the dead of night.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, no... That's, that's a good point...
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... What of...the throbbing?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Sorry? What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Your head, man. The throbbing of your head since this morning. We have all suffered with it.
</line><line>Susato:
Ah!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Oh, yes... I have had a headache, you're right. In fact, I haven't been feeling myself since I woke up today.
</line><line>Susato:
Nor have I! My head has been feeling heavy ever since dawn.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, you've all been afflicted, haven't you? Just as I suspected.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He's right! My head's been throbbing today, too! And since eating dinner yesterday evening, everything has felt sort of hazy. I can't really remember anything that happened after I climbed back inside the wardrobe... Then the first thing I noticed this morning was the throbbing pain in my head. I had already been dragged out of the wardrobe... ...and had those handcuffs put on me by that point... Why didn't I wake up when all that was happening to me?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Tell me, Mr Naruhodo... ...you boarded this vessel as <textEffects>a stowaway</textEffects>, didn't you?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... Well yes. ...Sorry.
</line><line>Sholmes:
The stowaway class of accommodation doesn't usually include meals. ...What did you survive on?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, well, Kazuma looked after me. He was always happy to share his meals.
</line><line>Sholmes:
So you enjoyed some of the whole roast chicken dish that was served yesterday evening, I take it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! In fact... ...I had all of that. Kazuma wasn't fond of chicken.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh really? So the victim <textEffects>didn't eat</textEffects> any of the chicken at all?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's right. He didn't touch it. ...Is that relevant?
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... My dear fellow, does that not strike you?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean to say... ...that there was <textEffects>something wrong</textEffects> with the chicken?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
...I do.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! <textEffects>(Really? Is that really true?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
The meal prepared for the passengers last night had been <textEffects>tampered</textEffects> with. <textEffects>Tampered</textEffects> with by the addition of a soporific, designed to induce a very deep slumber in those who consumed it.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
...<textEffects>A sleeping drug</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you mean...? ...whoever did this laced every meal with <textEffects>a sleeping drug</textEffects> so no one would notice the ship's <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects>?!
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! Of course that's not what Mr Sholmes means. What a far-fetched idea!
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Precisely. Lacing every meal of every passenger on board with <textEffects>a soporific drug</textEffects> would certainly be impossible. ...Unless, that is, every single member of the crew was <textEffects>a conspirator</textEffects>!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What?!
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
...Well, Seaman?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Eh...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm sorry to say that any more deception in this matter will get you nowhere.
</line><line>Strogenov:
.........
</line><line>Sholmes:
If you refuse to talk, there would have to be an inquiry made through the shipping company, of course. And were that to happen, every member of the crew, and the captain himself, would be hauled over the coals. ...For aiding and abetting <textEffects>a renegade</textEffects>.
</line><line>Strogenov:
...! .........
</line><line>Pavlova:
Please...no more. I will tell everything.
</line><line>Strogenov:
Eh?!
</line><line>Pavlova:
I cannot make problems like this for everyone any more...
</line><line>Sholmes:
These crewmen are your former <textEffects>comrades</textEffects>, I believe.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Yes. So when I decided to...run away... I asked them to help me.
</line><line>Strogenov:
We all agreed to help. Everyone together. She threw away everything. Her fame in the ballet... Mother Russia... We wanted to help our angel.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I don't believe it...
</line><line>Strogenov:
You are right. We put <textEffects>sleeping drug</textEffects> in chicken last night.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember now. I did notice chewing on a lump of something strange and bitter at one point...
</line><line>Strogenov:
Da. We could not make all <textEffects>drug</textEffects>... How do you say? ...Dissolve?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Ugh... Talk about heavy seasoning...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Strogenov:
...At midnight, in waters near Shanghai, we brought our angel on board. She was helped by comrade on shore with small fishing boat.
</line><line>Sholmes:
While all the passengers of the SS Burya slept soundly... ...thanks to the almost magical effects of the slumber-inducing <textEffects>potion</textEffects> their evening meals had contained.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So, if that's what happened... ...the only people <textEffects>awake</textEffects> on the ship last night... ...were the crew, people who dislike chicken and... ...the newly boarded passenger, Miss Pavlova.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...And that means it would have been <textEffects>possible</textEffects> for you. You could have used the emergency stop <textEffects>trick</textEffects> to lock Kazuma's cabin door!
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But how does that make sense? Surely every cabin door would have ended up locked in that case, and there would have been complete chaos.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh, I wouldn't say so.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course! Just like us, all the other passengers would have eaten their evening meal of chicken in their cabins. After which they would have been overwhelmed by tiredness because of the sleeping drug.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Quite. And accordingly, all passengers were already in their cabins for the night.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes!
</line><line>Sholmes:
The overwhelming majority of passengers would habitually sleep with their cabin doors bolted anyway. And so not one of them would have found it remarkable to find the door locked in the morning. In summary... In order to fasten the bolt of a single cabin door on the ship... ...the culprit brought the entire vessel to <textEffects>an emergency stop</textEffects> in the early hours of the morning!
</line><line>Susato:
...!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
...!
</line><line>Strogenov:
......... You have talked long time and said many things. What is point?
</line><line>Sholmes:
The point is what I said earlier. There was <textEffects>somebody else</textEffects> present on the scene when the victim lost his life last night. Someone who left a message in Russian on the floor in an attempt to incriminate another. Someone who tried desperately to hide the broken fragments of glass that would reveal the culprit's identity. And someone who abused the ship's <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects> procedure in order to lock a door. ...All told, a busy night.
</line><line>Pavlova:
But...but... I...I don't know about any of this! I am just a little girl!
</line><line>Strogenov:
You like to speak with your long English words and explain your clever ideas. But I am sailor. And sailors don't listen to long, boring stories. We don't believe. Sailors like me, we trust only what we see with our own eyes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
......... A laudable trait.
</line><line>Strogenov:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I am quite of the same disposition, my good man. Observation to me is everything. Mr Naruhodo...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Do you hear it? That accusatory cry of guilt on the wind?
</line><line>Susato:
What 'accusatory cry of guilt'...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
S-Sorry, you've... You've lost me.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Proof of involvement, man. But you can't <textEffects>hear</textEffects> such a call with your ears. No, you must hear it with your <textEffects>eyes</textEffects>! For observation is the basis of all deduction!
</line><line>Strogenov:
What are you TALKING ABOUT?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
I believe the time has come... ...for one final '<textEffects>Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</textEffects>' to expose the truth! So, Mr Naruhodo, your assistance, if you please!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
With what exactly, Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
With <textEffects>observation</textEffects>, my dear fellow! Just as I said. Of these two prevaricators.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Observation...?
</line><line>Susato:
If you remember, Mr Naruhodo, we know that somebody tried to fabricate evidence, don't we? By <textEffects>tampering</textEffects> with the scene of Mr Asogi's death. What we're looking for is some <textEffects>trace of evidence</textEffects> that one of these two was there when it happened.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Precisely! You are delightfully quick to grasp my meaning!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll see what I can see! So we're looking for <textEffects>a trace</textEffects> of evidence that shows <textEffects>someone else</textEffects> was there last night when Kazuma died...
</line>



<line>
</line>




<line>Ryunosuke:
How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?
</line><line>Susato:
I can think of two possible ways: Either we find a trace of something that the person in question left behind at the scene... ...or, if that's not possible...
</line><line>Sholmes:
...A trace of something that the person took away from the scene, be that accidentally or deliberately.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(A trace of something someone took away...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
If you observe closely enough, I believe you will find examples of both. Give them a long, hard and uncompromising stare from all sides, that's my advice!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov... ...You seem to have quite a large purple <textEffects>stain</textEffects> on the back of your white uniform there.
</line><line>Strogenov:
Eh? Ah, yes, I, um... I don't know where the dirt comes from...
</line><line>Sholmes:
So nothing in particular comes to mind about <textEffects>the stain</textEffects>?
</line><line>Strogenov:
What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Sholmes:
It would appear that <textEffects>the significance</textEffects> of this stain has escaped your attention, Seaman. Allow us to make it plain!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
It's a very large purple <textEffects>stain</textEffects> on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform.
</line><line>Susato:
And I think <textEffects>what made it</textEffects> is clear.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed it is. So, Mr Naruhodo, present <textEffects>the evidence</textEffects> that proves it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
My pleasure! Alright then. The evidence that proves what that <textEffects>stain</textEffects> on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform really is...
</line>


<line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! It's this photograph, and <textEffects>the ink</textEffects> it shows! That's what caused the stain on your uniform!
</line><line>Strogenov:
Ink?
</line><line>Sholmes:
A rather unusual colour of ink, purple.
</line><line>Strogenov:
Agh!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah, the penny drops...at last. Now you see <textEffects>the significance</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The Russian word on the floor next to the victim's body was written in purple <textEffects>ink</textEffects>. And the stain on the back of your uniform...is <textEffects>ink</textEffects> of exactly the same colour!
</line><line>Sholmes:
If the ink had been dry, it couldn't possibly have stained your uniform in that way. Which means... ...you must have been present in the cabin in the moments <textEffects>immediately after</textEffects> the ink was spilt!
</line><line>Strogenov:
......... Alright, yes. It was me. I did it. ...Everything.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Strogenov:
I <textEffects>arranged everything</textEffects> in dead student's cabin to make it look like wardrobe man did it. Then I pressed button to make Burya do <textEffects>emergency stop</textEffects>, and bolt cabin door shut. ...I did everything so no one would suspect our angel.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Bif, please...
</line><line>Strogenov:
Don't worry, angel. Let me do talking. It was after one in the morning. I was on duty, patrolling passageway. Then our angel came to me. She was white like sheet.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Pavlova:
'Bif! Please! You must help me!'
</line>
<hr />
<line>Strogenov:
I went with her. The door to cabin number one was open. When I looked inside...I saw student boy on floor.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Strogenov:
</line>
<center>'Wha-What happened here?!'</center>
<line>
Pavlova:
</line>
<center>'......... Please...don't tell anyone... ...My little one... My little furry <textEffects>friend</textEffects>...'</center>
<hr />
<line>Strogenov:
Everything that happened in cabin is like angel told you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The kitten escaped through the ventilator into Mr Asogi's cabin... Then he <textEffects>tripped</textEffects> over it and broke his neck when he fell to the floor?
</line><line>Strogenov:
...Yes. That is right.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
So after <textEffects>the incident</textEffects> when the cat ran away, Miss Pavlova then visited the cabin next to hers?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Only to find its occupant lying <textEffects>lifeless</textEffects> on the floor.
</line><line>Strogenov:
She said she was worried when she heard sound of something falling on floor. That's when she went to look. ...No, angel?
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Strogenov:
The door was not locked. So she opened to look, and...you already know what happened after.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Susato:
There's just one thing...if you wouldn't mind?
</line><line>Strogenov:
What?
</line><line>Susato:
When you went to Mr Asogi's cabin, Miss Pavlova... ...was he...already dead?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Why...?
</line><line>Strogenov:
I already told you! When Nina opened door of student's cabin and looked inside-
</line><line>Susato:
I was asking Miss Pavlova.
</line><line>Strogenov:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... ...<textEffects>Дa</textEffects>...
</line><line>Susato:
Oh...
</line><line>Pavlova:
Yes...that is right. I saw him... It was dark, and he was wearing black, but... He was on the floor. ...Not moving... I was scared... .........
</line><line>Susato:
......... I understand. And...I believe you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So is that finally it now? Have we discovered <span style="color:#E16935">the real truth</textEffects> about Kazuma's death at last?)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Ah! Something very nearly slipped my mind!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Mr Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
This photograph... Yes, I took this myself, you know. The cause of death was a broken neck. Therefore, the victim died instantly. And the unfortunate incident that precipitated these events? A kitten, on which the victim <textEffects>stumbled</textEffects>. ...However, if those are the facts, there is one particular area in this photograph... ...that seems to me somewhat <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects>.
</line><line>Strogenov:
What do you mean, '<textEffects>unnatural</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Sholmes:
What are your thoughts on the matter, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...Oh! Well... <textEffects>(If Kazuma <span style="color:#E16935">tripped</textEffects> and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck... ...which part of this photographic print seems <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects>?)</span>
</line>



<line>Ryunosuke:
Alright, if he really fell due to an unfortunate accident... ...then this <textEffects>fist</textEffects> just doesn't seem quite right.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...The exact same thought occurred to me. In a fall, one's instinct is to <textEffects>open the palms</textEffects> flat. Yet here we see the victim with his left hand tightly balled into a fist. Almost, you might say... ...as though he were <textEffects>gripping</textEffects> something.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Strogenov:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Simply that I took the liberty... ...of investigating the victim's <textEffects>fist</textEffects> a short while ago.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You did?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And what, pray, do you imagine I found there... my dear fellow?
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes... Show us! Please!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Why of course, my dear madam. Would I keep you in suspense? This is what I found.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, <textEffects>a crescent moon</textEffects> with a little gemstone in the middle?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Yes, you're right. A crescent moon. It's very pretty, but what does it tell us?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Hmph. It tells us nothing!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I'm not so sure. That <span style="color:#E16935">crescent moon</textEffects> looks... It looks familiar somehow. I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>Observation</textEffects>, Mr Naruhodo. That is the key.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Sholmes:
<textEffects>The truth</textEffects> is now tantalisingly close.
</line><line>Susato:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(How did that <span style="color:#E16935">crescent moon</textEffects> come to be in Kazuma's clenched fist...?)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
This is the final clue. The last piece of the puzzle! Ask yourself, what does this little crescent moon mean? What significance has it? And observe! Find the answer with your own eyes!
</line>




<line>
</line>





<line>Sholmes:
My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong. It's too late for words of advice!
</line><line>Susato:
The crescent moon is the last clue that Kazuma-sama left for us. And I believe it tells us everything!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(So all that remains is for me to find out how. The answer must be here somewhere! I just need to look at this from all angles...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Sholmes:
Now, the missing <textEffects>crescent moon</textEffects> was found in the victim's <textEffects>clenched fist</textEffects>. ...Clearly there is only one logical conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes. Miss Pavlova... Mr Asogi must have <textEffects>grasped</textEffects> that <textEffects>crescent moon</textEffects> and pulled it from your <textEffects>ear</textEffects>. Perhaps just <textEffects>moments before</textEffects> he fell to the floor.
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...last night, in Mr Asogi's cabin, you <textEffects>witnessed</textEffects> the moment when the victim fell with your own eyes. In fact, you were quite literally at arm's length from him.
</line><line>Strogenov:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But then the question is, why did Mr Asogi do that? Why did he pull your <textEffects>earring</textEffects> from your ear, and hold it in his clenched fist during his final moments?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no...
</line><line>Strogenov:
Angel...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No one can <textEffects>protect</textEffects> you now. Please, Miss Pavlova, tell us the truth. Last night... ...WHAT did you do to Kazuma?!
</line><line>Pavlova:
Agh!
</line>
<center>Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeт!</center>
<line>
</line>
<center>When I think about everything that happened yesterday... It, it was too much. Running away...the fishing boat in the middle of the night...trying to climb onto this huge ship... And then... ...when I was at last in this cabin and I could relax after this horrible, long day...
<hr />
<line>MIAOOOOOW!!!
</line><line>Darka! Wait!
</line><line>......... I couldn't believe it when she disappeared through the...the ventilator. I tried to call her with...a little whistle... I, I tried waving her favourite toy... But nothing worked. Darka would not come back.
</line><line>*Knock knock*
.........
*Clunk*
</line>
What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?</center>
<line>
Kazuma:
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
</line>
<hr />
<center>The young man from your country, he was very polite. And kind. He helped me to find Darka. And...he promised not to tell anyone. But then...when I had my friend in my arms again and I was going to leave the man's cabin...</center>
<hr />
<center>Just a moment! Sorry, but...</center>
<line>
Pavlova:
Oh... Yes?
</line><line>Kazuma:
I'm sure I know your face. I've seen you somewhere before...
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Ah, of course! You're <textEffects>Nikolina Pavlova</textEffects>, aren't you? The Russian ballerina.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Huh? N-No! I, I don't know that name.
</line>
<hr />
<center>My heart nearly stopped when he said that. He knew who I was! How could this man from a land in the faraway East know a Russian ballerina?!</center>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
Yes, I saw your performance in Japan. The beauty of the ballet made a deep impression on me. But...what are you doing on this ship? I'm sure I read that your ballet company was performing in Shanghai at the moment.
</line>
<hr />
<center>'...I can't fool him. ...I have to tell him the truth, and hope he doesn't tell anyone. I have no other choice.'</center>
<hr />
<line>Kazuma:
Hm, I see... So you've <textEffects>run away</textEffects>...
</line><line>Pavlova:
Please! Please keep my secret! Don't tell anyone!
</line><line>Kazuma:
Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...
</line>
<hr />
<center>'...He's going to pull that cord! He's going to tell the captain! Why did I think I could trust him?!' Then it happened... Everything at once... It was only a second, but...it felt like forever... 'Wait!' I shouted. And then...
<hr />
<line>MIAOOOOOW!!!
</line>
<hr />
Darka jumped out of my arms and down to the young man's feet. And... ...as he turned around to look at me... ...I, I pushed him! I don't even know why! I don't know why I did it! I, I was just so scared! And... ...I had to stop him from telling anyone about me.</center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
......... And that's when you went to fetch help? From Seaman Strogenov, who was on duty out in the passageway.
</line><line>Strogenov:
I heard Nina cry out, and thud on floor. So I ran to her. She was standing at cabin door, shaking like leaf. She looked at me and said:
</line>
<hr />
<center>Help me, Bif! If they find out, I will be... Please! I have nowhere to go!</center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
So you decided to help. And that's when you <textEffects>arranged things</textEffects> in Kazuma's cabin to make it look like I did it... ...so that no one would suspect <textEffects>the passenger</textEffects> in the cabin next door?
</line><line>Strogenov:
...Yes. I went into cabin and I looked around...to make sure there was nothing to show Nina was there. And then I found <textEffects>stowaway</textEffects>. In wardrobe. Still sleeping.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Right. That's when he found me.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
So you worked out a plan. To lay the blame on <textEffects>the stowaway</textEffects>.
</line><line>Strogenov:
......... I closed wardrobe doors and put back strange paper <textEffects>sign</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Luckily for me. That's the only reason Susato-san <span style="color:#E16935">started to believe me</textEffects> when I said I was innocent.)</span>
</line><line>Strogenov:
I dragged young man's body to good place, and used ink that was spilling to write on floor. I wrote '<textEffects>ГАРДЕРОБ</textEffects>' so that person who found him would look inside <textEffects>wardrobe</textEffects> and find stowaway.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And tell me, what of the glass bell?
</line><line>Pavlova:
It was by my feet, so I picked it up.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I see.
</line><line>Pavlova:
But it was dark in the cabin. I didn't notice the other half.
</line><line>Strogenov:
Then angel went back to her cabin, and I finished job.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
By pressing the emergency alarm <textEffects>button</textEffects> in the passageway?
</line><line>Strogenov:
...Yes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Accordingly, the SS Burya did indeed come to <textEffects>an emergency halt</textEffects> at a little after 2 a.m. Thus enticing the bolt on the cabin door to slide shut, creating the <textEffects>locked room</textEffects> mystery.
</line><line>Strogenov:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's still one thing I don't understand, Miss Pavlova.
</line><line>Pavlova:
What?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, you said that you told Kazuma about the fact that you'd <textEffects>run away</textEffects> from your homeland. And it's because you were worried he was going to tell the captain that you pushed him. ...Isn't that right?
</line><line>Pavlova:
Yes...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But even if he had pulled the bell cord and called for the captain of the ship... ...aren't you <textEffects>friends</textEffects> with every member of the crew? Why would that have been a problem?
</line><line>Pavlova:
......... It was what he said first. That made me scared.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What he said first?
</line>
<hr />
<center>What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?</center>
<line>
Kazuma:
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Pavlova:
He said <textEffects>an inspector</textEffects>...was <textEffects>his friend</textEffects>...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Ah! Yes, meaning me... ...who was supposed to be acting as <textEffects>his bodyguard</textEffects>...
</line><line>Pavlova:
I thought that if <textEffects>police</textEffects> knew about me...they would arrest me. ......... So before he could pull the bell cord, I, I...
</line><line>Susato:
May I stop you a moment, please, Miss Pavlova?
</line><line>Pavlova:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
It just...<textEffects>doesn't seem to make sense</textEffects>. I mean, was Mr Asogi really going to pull the bell cord? I don't know...
</line><line>Pavlova:
Wha...?
</line><line>Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Well, I'm not Kazuma, so I can't know for certain. But... ...he was a man of his word. If he told you he wouldn't give your secret away, then he wouldn't have done.
</line><line>Pavlova:
No! He, he was walking over to it! He was going to pull the cord! He was going to make them send me back...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, Mr Naruhodo... ...the day's work is not yet done, it seems. There is one more <textEffects>deduction</textEffects> to make.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? Another <textEffects>deduction</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes. What action was the victim really about to take at that moment? Can we determine whither the young man's <textEffects>gaze</textEffects> was directed? First, consider the victim's location within his cabin.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
That's easy. I remember every detail of that room. I mean, yes, I spent quite a lot of time in the wardrobe, but still... ...that cabin has been my home for this entire <textEffects>voyage</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
So this is how the cabin looked last night, when Miss Pavlova visited Kazuma-sama?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's exactly how it was.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Are you ready then, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! <textEffects>(If there's one thing I've learnt today... ...it's that a simple gaze can reveal all manner of <span style="color:#E16935">truths</textEffects>. And not only that. In order to draw the right conclusion... ...you can't afford to be out by even a little bit when you're following the gaze to <textEffects>where it lands</textEffects>.)</span> So, when he turned away from Miss Pavlova, <textEffects>what exactly was Kazuma looking at</textEffects>?
</line>



<line>
</line>



<line>Sholmes:
No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I knew him well. At the very least, I'm convinced of one thing: Kazuma wouldn't have just called a crewman or the captain in that situation.
</line><line>Susato:
According to Miss Pavlova, Kazuma's exact words were: 'I could use another opinion here.'
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Whose opinion was he hoping for? I feel sure I ought to know...)</textEffects> 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
Considering everything that had happened last night... ...certainly it may have looked as though Kazuma was going to ring <textEffects>the bell cord</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes. However... ...what is directly beside the bell cord? <textEffects>The wardrobe</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pavlova:
The...<textEffects>wardrobe</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Sholmes:
And, more importantly, what was inside the wardrobe? The man's great <textEffects>friend</textEffects>. Sleeping soundly.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Ah!
</line><line>Susato:
Miss Pavlova, please, think back very carefully. What were Mr Asogi's exact words last night?
</line>
<hr />
<center>Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...</center>
<hr />
<line>Pavlova:
'<textEffects>Another opinion</textEffects>'...
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yes, but not from a member of the crew. No, Mr Asogi intended to consult his close friend on the matter. To see if, between them, they might be able to help in some way, no doubt.
</line><line>Pavlova:
Oh no...
</line><line>Susato:
Sadly, we can't know the truth for certain now. It's too late for that. But I wish you had made sure of what Mr Asogi was looking at. Things may have ended very differently if you had.
</line><line>Pavlova:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova... I want to thank you for finally admitting the truth. But, unfortunately... ...<textEffects>the truth</textEffects> is, a man lost his life because of what you did. And that will never change. I hope you'll never forget that.
</line><line>Pavlova:
I'm sorry... Really... I'm so, so sorry... What have I done...
</line>
<center>And so, at long last... ...the mystery surrounding the tragic accident on the SS Burya... ...was finally laid to rest.</center>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>9th January, 7:14 p.m.
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin Passageway</textEffects></center>
<line>
Ryunosuke:
What will happen to Miss Pavlova now then?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Once we reach Great Britain, she'll be handed over to the British police at Scotland Yard.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What about the fact that she <textEffects>ran away</textEffects> from Russia? Won't the Russians try to repatriate her?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Apparently the English detective can speak to the immigration office and sort all that out.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Mr Sholmes can do that...?)</textEffects> So she won't be going back to Russia, then?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
No, I don't think so. Even if she wanted to return in the future, I doubt she would be able to. She ran away, so now she's <textEffects>an exile</textEffects> for life.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I see...
</line><line>Strogenov:
I'm sorry...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov?
</line><line>Strogenov:
I wanted to help our angel. No matter what. But...I didn't think about you. About how you lost good friend. I will go with Nina. I will give myself to British police.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That's kind of you. In the meantime...thank you for letting me <textEffects>go free</textEffects> again. Kazuma's death...feels like such a waste. But... Well...do what you can for Miss Pavlova, won't you?
</line><line>Strogenov:
Da.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Well, I'm afraid you need to pack now. We're due to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. As much as it pains me... ...I'm going to have to hand you over to the consul to arrange your <textEffects>passage back to Japan</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes. <textEffects>(I did <span style="color:#E16935">stow away</textEffects>, after all. I couldn't really expect any different.)</span>
</line><line>Hosonaga:
So, you should get back to your cabin now.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(It looks like my study tour to Great Britain is over before it's even begun, then. To think that only days ago, Kazuma and I were laughing together about how we'd tear up the streets of London... That seems like a distant memory now.)</textEffects> ......... Oh...what's that? <textEffects>(Is it...someone weeping?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Susato-san?
</line><line>Susato:
...! Naruhodo-san! I, I didn't know you had returned.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, erm, well...I haven't been back long. Inspector Hosonaga just told me I should pack. You know...ready to leave the ship tomorrow and all that.
</line><line>Susato:
......... ......... I still...can't believe this has happened. I can't believe someone's life can be over, just like that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Susato-san...
</line><line>Susato:
He had such grand ideas for this visit to Great Britain. So many dreams. And now they've been cruelly <textEffects>taken away</textEffects>. ...Just as he has. I thought I could never forgive the person responsible. But now... ...now we know the truth. That it was just <textEffects>an accident</textEffects>. Just a silly series of <textEffects>mishaps</textEffects>. It's too much, Naruhodo-san. It's just too much...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, I know.
</line><line>???:
I wish there was something...I could say...
</line><line>Susato:
Inspector...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
My duty was to see Asogi-san safely to Great Britain. But I failed. And caused his two closest friends great pain and suffering as a result. I've let everyone down. And I will do ANYTHING to make up for my terrible blunder!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Nobody blames you, Inspector. And I'm <textEffects>free</textEffects> again now, at leas- Huh?
</line><line>Sholmes:
</line>
<center>Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</center>
<line>Surprised, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What...is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh, a trifling matter. Simply that in my head, I think I shall always picture you <textEffects>wearing those shackles</textEffects>. Without them, the balance seems all wrong. It's...<textEffects>distracting</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Sholmes:
So I decided to restore them. For old times' sake, shall we say? You are <textEffects>a stowaway</textEffects>, after all. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(He thinks this is funny?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes... We do appreciate all your assistance. I'd like to thank you...from the bottom of my heart.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Not at all, not at all. And though it's a little late, may I offer my sincere condolences? The loss of your companion is truly heartrending. I hope that you will be able to fulfil some of his aspirations in his honour.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I'm afraid that won't be possible. We shall be disembarking at the next port. In Hong Kong. We have to return to Japan and make a full report about everything that's happened.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? Wait a minute! It's just me that has to go back, isn't it? I mean, I was <textEffects>the stowaway</textEffects>!
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>The terms</textEffects> of this study tour were negotiated by the Department of Justice in both Great Britain and Japan. It was to be one lawyer and one assistant.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
'Was to be'?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
In the light of Mr Asogi's unfortunate death... ...I'm afraid the study tour can no longer go ahead.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Oh no. I don't care for me, but... ...poor Susato-san.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
My dear fellows, the majority of problems have an extremely simple solution, you know!
</line><line>Sholmes:
All you require is one <textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>, and the study tour can continue, surely?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Susato:
But there is no one else with the necessary qualifications, Mr Sholmes. We know of no other <textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Qualifications, you say? Any qualifications obtained in your own country will be of little value in Great Britain, I'm afraid.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, but...
</line><line>Sholmes:
But anyway, the voyage to London still promises a good month of time. Ample opportunity, I would say, to find yourselves another suitable <textEffects>lawyer</textEffects>.
</line><line>Susato:
...Yes...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
......... Um...Miss Susato?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Do you think perhaps...I might be able to do it?
</line><line>Susato:
Ah!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But you're not a lawyer, Mr Naruhodo. Oh, unless... Are you studying law?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, I'm not, but-
</line><line>Hosonaga:
I'm sorry. In that case, I don't think there's even a chance it could work.
</line><line>Sholmes:
But as I said, there is still more than a month before we reach England's shores. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I have a month in which to study! To learn what I must to become a lawyer in Great Britain.
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
</line><line>Hosonaga:
That's ridiculous! Are you seriously suggesting anybody could learn all of that in just forty days?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
There's only one way to find out! I would work my fingers to the bone, Inspector. Every single day. ...Will you let me try? And if, by the time we reach Great Britain, I haven't learnt enough to be recognised as a lawyer... ...I'll take whatever punishment is deemed appropriate.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
But...why put yourself in such a difficult position?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
For Kazuma. He said that there was something he had to do in Great Britain. And that he would sacrifice anything to make it happen.
</line><line>Susato:
...!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
He was <textEffects>passionate</textEffects> about it. I can't let all that passion just come to nothing. And anyway, it's for my own benefit, too. I will become <textEffects>a lawyer</textEffects>. I have to. ...What do you say, Miss Susato?
</line><line>Susato:
......... ...I think it's a wonderful idea.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Thank you...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
So...what does our bespectacled inspector friend say?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
Are you serious?
</line><line>Sholmes:
One lawyer and one assistant. The numbers are indisputable.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
No no no! It's madness!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Yet fascinating, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
'<textEffects>Fascinating</textEffects>'?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Duty and rules are the dull routine of existence that we all abhor. Give us <textEffects>interest</textEffects>! Give us <textEffects>fascination</textEffects>!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
<textEffects>Speak for yourself</textEffects>!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Besides... ...qualifications are no measure of a man. What matters is his character...no?
</line><line>Hosonaga:
...!
</line><line>Sholmes:
And you've witnessed ample evidence of this man's exemplary character today with your own eyes. From the early hours of this morning until this very moment now. Despite contending with the passing of his close companion, and despite the accusation of guilt... ...this man has shown resourcefulness, intelligence and above all, courage.
</line><line>Hosonaga:
......... Very well. I'll think of a clever way to word my report to the Department of Justice.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
After all, I did just make a promise, didn't I? I said that I'd do anything at all to make up for my shortcomings here.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, thank you, Inspector!
</line><line>Hosonaga:
If you'll excuse me, I must pay a visit to the captain's quarters, I think. I need to discuss what to do next, and how best to make my report.
</line><line>Susato:
Are you really prepared to attempt this, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm going to try. I wonder... ...would you consider teaching me what I need to know? Everything about being <textEffects>a lawyer</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:
......... I would be delighted to help you! I AM a judicial assistant, after all!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Thank you!
</line><line>Susato:
And...Mr Naruhodo... ...I'd like you to take charge of this.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What? Me?! ...Are you sure?
</line><line>Susato:
I'm sure it's what Kazuma-sama would have wanted. Its name is 'Karuma'. It's a great sword, that's been in the Asogi clan for generations.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Very well, I accept. I'll treasure it always. So then, Miss Susato... ...it seems we'll be working together for some time to come yet!
</line><line>Susato:
It will be an honour, Mr Naruhodo. And for the next forty days, I shan't grant you a single minute of freedom. We shall fill every spare moment with study!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's exactly what I need!
</line><line>Susato:
But...before we begin... I have an earnest favour to ask of you, too.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Goodness. ...What is it?
</line><line>Susato:
......... Please throw me to the ground. Three times!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
</line><line>Susato:
I should never have doubted you. You were Kazuma-sama's closest friend. Of course you would never have done anything to hurt him. That should have been obvious to me from the start. But I allowed suspicion to get the better of me. And no matter how upset I was feeling...it was completely unforgivable behaviour.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No! No, you were in shock. You'd just found out about me <textEffects>stowing away</textEffects>. And the cabin door was locked from the inside-
</line><line>Susato:
No! I won't let you make excuses for me! Whatever the circumstances, I should never have thrown you! And not just once, but FIVE times!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Haah... <textEffects>(That number keeps creeping up, doesn't it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
Please, you must! Just take hold of me and throw me! Do it! Don't even think about it!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No no no! I don't even know how! I've never thrown anyone in my life!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Very wise, Mr Naruhodo. It isn't a skill one acquires without considerable training.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes...
</line><line>Sholmes:
I observed your throwing technique several times with great interest. I confess I was most impressed.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(When did he see that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
I presume that would be a form of Japanese wrestling?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, well...in a way. It's not wrestling, but my own interpretation of an ancient jujutsu technique.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Apparently it's called the Susato Takedown. It leaves your head swimming, believe me.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hm... How beguiling... I am a practitioner of the combative arts myself. I am a somewhat accomplished <textEffects>boxer</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(There he goes, dancing around again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
I wonder if you'd be so kind as to instruct me on the technique of your arresting <textEffects>throw</textEffects>?
</line><line>Susato:
......... Yes! I'd be honoured!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Then let us not dally! Demonstrate, my dear madam!
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! Of, of course! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
</line><line>Susato:
Haiiiiii-YA! ...As you can see, you throw from the abdomen.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Oh yes, arresting indeed! And that is what you term <textEffects>the Susato Takedown</textEffects>, is it?
</line><line>Susato:
Actually, no. That was <textEffects>a Susato Squash</textEffects>!
</line>
<center><textEffects>(In my groggy state of consciousness... ...<span style="color:#E16935">a scene</textEffects> from an evening recently spent with Kazuma flickered into my mind...)</span></center>
<hr />
<line>Ryunosuke:
...'<textEffects>Karuma</textEffects>'...?
</line><line>Kazuma:
That's right. It's a prized sword that's been passed down through generations of the Asogi clan.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I can't believe you managed to get permission to bring it with you! I mean, taking a katana on a study tour is more than a little irregular, surely?
</line><line>Kazuma:
A Japanese man's sword is his soul, Ryunosuke. I can't be parted from my katana. Karuma guides me. I truly believe that.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
So its name compels its wielder to <textEffects>slice evil in two</textEffects>? Not that you would need much compelling...
</line><line>Kazuma:
On that subject... ...there's something very important that I have to do in Great Britain. And I'll sacrifice anything to make it happen. I'd appreciate you seeing it through with me.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Of, of course I will. Whatever it is, I'll see it through to the end with you.
</line><line>Kazuma:
...I knew you wouldn't let me down.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>(That <span style="color:#E16935">important thing</textEffects> he had to do... I still don't know what that was. But I'm going to see the place for myself and work it out. In Great Britain's capital...London.)</span></center>
