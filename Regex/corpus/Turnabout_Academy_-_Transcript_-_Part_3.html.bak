Athena:
...Sorry, Boss. I couldn't do it. You know, that little bit of advice you gave me? "The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles"? I don't know exactly what you meant... ...but there was no way I could force a smile in that courtroom today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm just glad you remembered that. But now how about relaxing a little--
</line><line>Athena:
R-Relax?! Not gonna happen!
</line><line>Phoenix:
.........
</line><line>Athena:
Junie... she asked me to defend her because she believes in me. But I... I... felt completely helpless. If it weren't for their confessions, I'd...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(No, I can't lose it all! Not now!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
You okay, Athena? You're turning kind of pale.
</line><line>Athena:
...I can't just stand around here! I'm going to finish the investigation!
</line><line>Trucy:
Can't it wait? I just took a batch of freshly baked cookies out of my magic panties!
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks, but I'd better get going! Save me one for when I get back. Apollo, you wait here! I need to see Junie at the Detention Center first right away!
</line><line>Apollo:
No, wait! I'm going with you! Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'd better go too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No problem. You two be careful.

Athena:
<textEffects>(There's so much I need to ask Junie. What happened in court today... Where we go from here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Well, now! Fancy meeting you here.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Prof. Means. What brings you here?
</line><line>Woods:
I asked him to come. He arrived just a little before you. I wanted to ask him something. But first, Athena... I want to apologize for my sudden confession after you worked so hard to defend me.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(She was calling me "Thena" until just now...)</textEffects> No, I should be the one apologizing. The whole thing spiraled out of my control.
</line><line>Woods:
Athena, I--
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry! I'll really bring it tomorrow! I'll find something to prove your innocence!
</line><line>Woods:
About that............ Athena... I've been thinking of asking Prof. Means to defend me.
</line><line>Athena:
...Huh?
</line><line>Means:
I myself only just heard of this a moment ago.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Oh... So, she thinks Prof. Means would be... No! I can't let this happen! Not with the way he wants to do things!)</textEffects> J-Junie!
</line><line>Woods:
I know, Athena, but will you please hear me out?

<line>Athena:
Is there anything else you noticed on the night of the murder?
</line><line>Woods:
...Well, I don't know if this will help, but... That evening, I went back to my dressing room to get something I'd forgotten there. It was well after the last bell rang... I'd say, maybe around 8:30.
</line><line>Athena:
Around 8:30, huh? That's over an hour after when the crime supposedly took place.
</line><line>Woods:
That's when I noticed that both stage statues were finished. They were quite large, and they were each covered with a white sheet, but I could tell. It made me happy to think that after all that hard work, they were finally finished.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, right... The statues that Robin made. So they were covered in white sheets...?
</line><line>Woods:
...*cough*... *cough* *cough*
</line><line>Athena:
J-Junie! Are you okay?
</line><line>Woods:
*cough* Sorry. I'm a little tired, that's all.
</line><line>Apollo:
Athena, I think this meeting is over. Prof. Means?
</line><line>Means:
I will use any means possible to get the result I want in Juniper's case. But it will require considerable preparation, so I must be off.
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
Junie! ...And Prof. Means! I have a proposal!
</line><line>Woods:
...A proposal?
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, this isn't another one of your crazy--
</line><line>Athena:
By sundown today...!
</line><line>Woods:
Yes...?
</line><line>Athena:
I, Athena Cykes, along with Apollo Justice...!
</line><line>Apollo:
W-Wait a second. Don't drag my name into--
</line><line>Athena:
We're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery!
</line><line>Woods:
......What?!
</line><line>Athena:
And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is!
</line><line>Means:
I see... So, it has come to this, has it?
</line><line>Athena:
If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.
</line><line>Woods:
.........
</line><line>Athena:
Then, you shouldn't need anyone else to defend you except me. Have we got a deal? ...I trust that's okay with you too, Prof. Means?
</line><line>Means:
I have no objections, as long as Juniper is satisfied with this arrangement.
</line><line>Woods:
............Okay. But only if it's the real truth. I'm sorry to put you through this, Thena. But thank you. I've been thinking only of myself this whole time.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie, it's way too early to thank me. But you can thank me all you want once I get to the bottom of this!
</line><line>Means:
...Very well, I will see you back here at sundown.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sorry for all the trouble, professor. It's just, she's new to the agency, so...
</line><line>Means:
Don't be silly. I find it all rather thrilling. Now, let us meet here again later!
</line><line>Woods:
If you'll excuse me, I'd better go.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, see you later!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Argh! This is no time to be thinking about that! I've got an investigation to do. I WILL find the truth by sundown, no matter what!)</textEffects>

???:
Ah!
</line><line>Athena:
Is it my imagination or did something just move?
</line><line>Klavier:
Afternoon, you two.
</line><line>Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin. What are you doing here? Don't you think sneaking onto campus like this... is just slightly suspicious?
</line><line>Klavier:
I'll have you know I'm continuing my investigation, in the strictest of confidence.
</line><line>Athena:
I don't want to be caught napping again at tomorrow's trial. And that means a thorough investigation today. Think you can lend us a hand?
</line><line>Klavier:
I'm not one to refuse a damsel in distress. But you needn't have asked, Fr√§ulein. I'd intended to help from the start.
</line><line>Athena:
You're the best, Prosecutor Gavin! <textEffects>(Okay, time for a thorough investigation. I bet we missed lots of stuff yesteday!)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
The more we learn, the deeper the rabbit hole goes.
</line><line>Klavier:
At least we're moving in the right direction. Let's keep searching the stage for clues.
</line><line>Athena:
I've been wondering about something this whole time. You know that pole at the edge of the stage?
</line><line>Apollo:
You mean this? It has a wire that goes off and connects to something somewhere.
</line>

<line>Athena:
Whew! That was a whole lot of poking around in such a short time.
</line><line>Apollo:
Does that mean you're satisfied?
</line><line>Athena:
Actually, there was one more thing I wanted to check out. See that metal fence back there? There's just that one segment, so it seems out of place.
</line><line>Klavier:
It looks like they were in the process of removing them after the stage was set up. But they were never able to finish on account of the murder.
</line><line>Apollo:
We should take a look if you think it could be important.
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... This track looks man-made.
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, you're right. And it looks like it starts from behind the backdrop.
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe a big muddy pro wrestler was hiding back there.
</line><line>Apollo:
.........Well, that was totally random, but we'll never know until we take a look.
</line><line>Athena:
Looks like something was being dragged through here, and this is where it started.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but whatever it was, it's long gone.
</line><line>Klavier:
Must've been pretty heavy. Perhaps it was used in setting up the school festival.
</line><line>Athena:
Aww, then I guess it wasn't a pro wrestler. Still, this could be something important.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Well, that's about it for the stage.
</line><line>Athena:
Right. I think we'd better search the art room next.
</line><line>Klavier:
I think I'll hang around here for a while. But make sure to tell me once you find it, ja?
</line><line>Apollo:
Find what?
</line><line>Klavier:
What else? The Gavinners banner that disappeared from the stage. You never know -- it just might be connected to the case at hand.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Really? Or does he just want his banner back?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Sss, sss, sss. Don't tell me... So, in short, that's...
</line><line>Athena:
Hm? Hey...
</line><line>Apollo:
That box... It just took off running.
</line><line>Athena:
I have a pretty good idea who that is, as I suspect you do, too. Come on! We can't afford to have any weird articles written about us!
</line><line>Apollo:
The maintenance area's over in that direction. After that box!

Athena:
...Myriam, you're liable to get tossed in the garbage truck if you hang around here.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
I'm just an empty box. And that's what you do with them -- you throw them away.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, did you change boxes? I like the new look.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
What does it matter anymore?! I was a complete failure in court today! My work, my pride, my dream -- everything I've worked so hard for... Gone!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Sorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
A f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Come to think of it, calling her a failure as a reporter might've been a bit extreme.
</line><line>Athena:
Nngh...
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Scold me! Despise me! Pack me away where I'll never see the light of day! I've been cast aside to waste away into a big pile of mushy paper mache!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I kind of feel responsible for this, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Now's our chance to prod her for information while she's vulnerable! I bet that's what you were just thinking.
</line><line>Athena:
What kind of a person do you think I am? <textEffects>(He read me like a book...)</textEffects>

<line>Scuttlebutt:
...Kahk-kahk-kahk. My laptop won't turn on. Never thought my life would end so soon. A mere seventeen years...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Now I really feel bad.)</textEffects> Oh, I know! Myriam, we have a laptop at the office. We'd be happy to lend it to you.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Huh? Y-You have a laptop I could use?!
</line><line>Athena:
Sure, but on one condition. I want you to ask Junie, Hugh, and Robin if you can hang out with them.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
What?! Like I could ever do that!
</line><line>Athena:
Sorry, but that's the deal if you want to borrow our laptop.
</line><line>Apollo:
You scare me sometimes, Athena. You're like good cop, bad cop all rolled into one.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk. Fine! I'll do it! If that's all you want!
</line><line>Athena:
Yay! I'll be by later to bring you the laptop!
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
W-Wait! It's not like I owe you anything, but here.
</line><line>Athena:
Th-Thanks. Oh, it's a set of pictures.
</line><line>Apollo:
Looks like they're setting up the stage.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Yeah, I took them when they were putting the stage's backdrop into place.
</line><line>Athena:
Wow, you sure have an eye for photography! <textEffects>(...From what I can make out, anyway.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
There are the last two photos that didn't get deleted. They're all yours.

</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss! Well, see you around, Scary Lawyer Lady!
</line><line>Apollo:
That was really impressive, Athena. What's next?
</line><line>Athena:
Well... I'd like to talk to Hugh or Robin if possible.
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay, let's walk around and see if we can find them!

Stop right there! This is an active crime scene! No unauthorized personnel allowed!

What? Can't you make an exception? You won't even notice we're--

If it was Mr. Wright, then sure, but you two? Meh...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I knew it. There's a hint of discord in Hugh's voice.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
You're not getting off that easy. After all, you're a possible suspect, plus you actually confessed in court.

Whatever. So, what do you want from me? But make it brief. I don't have a lot of time, and I assume you don't either.

He doesn't care about her anymore? Why would he say that?
</line><line>Apollo:
That didn't go so well. I guess we'll just have to pin our hopes on his testimony tomorrow. Athena, what do you say we head over to the art room. Might be a nice change of pace. Hopefully, the police have completed their investigation.

Thanks again for lowering that school banner for us earlier.

Don't mention it. Helping those in need is what my brand of justice is all about!
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... So, this art room was where the murder actually occurred?
</line><line>Fulbright:
That's right. You can't see it with the naked eye, but there's blood on the floor! That area roped off in the middle of the room marks the spot. The police investigation is done, so if you want to look around, knock yourselves out!

<line>Athena:
I know what this moon really is. And if you look at this photo, you'll know too. This shows where that moon in the photo came from and the truth of Junie's testimony.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Wh-Wha-What?! Where?! Where does it show that?!
</line><line>Athena:
If you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!
</line>


<line>Athena:
They were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet. This photo shows them in the process of moving the backdrop into position.
</line><line>Apollo:
I can see that. That's the big board hanging here. The size matches, too.
</line><line>Fulbright:
But there's no picture. That's a crucial detail.
</line><line>Athena:
It is, but I believe what we're seeing in this photo is the back of the board.
</line><line>Fulbright:
The back of the...?
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. And at around 6:00 PM when this was taken... ...a photo of that same board was being taken from the front.
</line><line>Fulbright:
What do you mean the front? The front is against the wall!
</line><line>Athena:
That's where you're wrong. What about the window? Remember how we said the moon shouldn't even exist in this photo? Take a good look.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Are you suggesting the moon is the one on the backdrop?!
</line><line>Athena:
Exactly! In short, this photo was taken while the backdrop was being moved! And as you can see here, it was around 6:00 when the backdrop was being set in place. So, the art room clock was running fast at least as far back as the day of the murder.
</line><line>Fulbright:
How-ow-ow... How can I ever face Prosecutor Blackquill now?!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Yes! I just blew a hole in a piece of the prosecution's evidence!)</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
Well, I think we've examined pretty much everything we can. By the way, did Prosecutor Blackquill happen to tell you anything about tomorrow's trial?
</line><line>Fulbright:
In justice we trust! It's no use trying to pry more information out of me! Having just learned that the clock had been one hour fast... ...means we're back to square one concerning the suspect's actions that day.
</line><line>Athena:
Hmm... I wonder what the main argument will be about now.
</line><line>Fulbright:
How the body was moved would be my guess, but Prosecutor Blackquill's got his own plans.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh? Does he now...?
</line><line>Athena:
Um, Detective Fulbright--
</line><line>Fulbright:
Try as you might, I won't say another word about the investigation!
</line><line>Athena:
No, I wasn't going to ask about that. I was just wondering if you'd seen Robin.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Oh, you mean Ms. Robin Newman? She was just here a moment ago! And she mumbled something about watching videos in the <textEffects>Lecture Hall</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Video? What video?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Thanks, Detective. ...Athena, I think we should stop by the Lecture Hall.

Right, let's go!

Oh, Athena, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
What are you watching there?
</line><line>Newman:
Heh heh... Oh, it just so happens to be a video of the mock trial. I had to use a bit of coercion to get it, but the end justifies the means, right?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(There it is again. Prof. Means sure has a lot of influence around here.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
Care to look into the true connection between the murder and the mock trial with me?
</line><line>Athena:
Sounds great, but do you mind if we ask you some questions first?
</line><line>Newman:
Eh heh heh. Sure, I'll tell you anything you W-A-N-T.

<line>Apollo:
Well, I think that about covers it.
</line><line>Newman:
Okay, then how about watching the mock trial video with me? What do you say?
</line><line>Athena:
Sure, sounds good to me. Er, so, how do you wanna watch it?
</line><line>Newman:
Eh heh heh. All classroom desks at this school have their own built-in computer, you know.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wow, this place is definitely a lot cushier than I thought!
</line><line>Newman:
I know you guys are in a hurry, so I'll just fast-forward to the important parts. Let's start with the professor's pre-trial speech.
</line><line><textEffects>"Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking you for coming here today."</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, that sounds like Prof. Means.
</line><line><textEffects>"The mock trial, the crown-jewel event of the school festival will begin shortly!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Is the camera like this the whole time?
</line><line>Newman:
Yeah, it's in a fixed position in front of the stage.
</line><line><textEffects>"When I was a student, I, too, could hardly wait for this day to come."</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
How come teachers' speeches always make me so sleepy?
</line><line>Newman:
Eh heh he. Let's just skip to the end of his speech.
</line><line><textEffects>"Now, let the mock trial begin!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?
</line><line>Apollo:
Looks to me like she cut right in front of the camera.
</line><line>Newman:
Eh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the <textEffects>audio</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Even though she was already playing a part in the mock trial itself?
</line><line>Newman:
She had to do it to keep the script details secret. She was all over the place that day. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.
</line><line>Athena:
Ooh, so this is what the Lecture Hall looks like.
</line><line>Apollo:
Looks like there's a judge's bench back by the screen, and a witness stand up front. What about those balconies with the professors' names on them?
</line><line>Newman:
Those are the faculty seats. Prof. Means and Prof. Courte were in charge of scoring the mock trial.
</line><line><textEffects>Lecture Hall Diagram added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
Okay, let's fast forward this a bit.
</line><line><textEffects>"...And that's why the defendant is... DEFINITELY GUILTYYYYYY!!!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
Ah, that was me! Could you tell?
</line><line><textEffects>"Objection! A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so."</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
You read that line in the mock mock trial, Apollo, but you made it sound kind of weird.
</line><line>Apollo:
Cut me some slack. It was my first time reading that script.
</line><line>Newman:
I think Juniper's going to speak next.
</line><line><textEffects>"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Wow, what an emotional performance. She'd put a real actress to shame.
</line><line>Athena:
Wait. Could you go back and play that scene again?
</line><line>Apollo:
You really think that's necessary?
</line><line><textEffects>"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Stop! Did you hear that?!
</line><line>Apollo:
I think you're on to something! Let's play that last part again!
</line><line>Newman:
I don't follow. What are you guys so excited about?
</line><line>Athena:
I think this piece of evidence should explain it. <textEffects>(Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
I'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat. I'll play it for you.
</line><line><textEffects>"...You're a goner!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
The voices and performance do sound similar, but... I can't believe this is happening!
</line><line>Athena:
It's just a possibility, but if the voice on this tape is really a recording... ...one made from the mock trial video, then that means this evidence was fabricated.
</line><line>Apollo:
They didn't get to do a voiceprint analysis in time for court today. That's why the gender of the voice became so important. And if the real killer had foreseen that gender would become key in today's trial...
</line><line>Athena:
...He would've tried to deflect attention away from himself by making the suspect female. So basically, the only one with something to gain from doing this is our <textEffects>sole male suspect</textEffects>.
</line><line>Newman:
Wait a second! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
Prof. Means's credo is "The end justifies the means." So it makes perfect sense that a student who took those words to heart... ...would fabricate evidence. We need to get that tape analyzed as soon as possible!
</line><line><textEffects>Tape Recorder updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
......Allow me to assist you with that.
</line><line>Athena:
Prosecutor Gavin! At least make some kind of noise so we know you're there!
</line><line>Klavier:
It's go big or go home with rock star entrances, Fr√§ulein. Timing is everything. Let me make a copy of that tape right now, and I'll get you the results as soon as I can. I trust that would be all right?
</line><line>Athena:
Very much so! Thanks!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Athena? It's almost sundown. Isn't it about time we head over to the Detention Center?
</line><line>Athena:
I think Junie will agree that this is something that could prove her innocence. But... <textEffects>(Will her heart really be open to accepting it? She had to have known this was what I'd find!)</textEffects>

Athena:
...And that about covers the main gist of our investigation.
</line><line>Means:
I see. Very interesting. You've been quite the busy beaver today.
</line><line>Woods:
Thank you for all your hard work, Athena. Well, my time's about up. And it will be getting dark soon, so...
</line><line>Athena:
Junie!
</line><line>Woods:
You must be tired after being on your feet all day. You should go home and--
</line><line>Athena:
No, wait! You have to listen to me!
</line><line>Woods:
I don't... I don't want to hear any more. I know what you're going to say, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie, you promised.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
We're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery! And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is! If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.
</line><line>Woods:
............Okay. But only if it's the real truth.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
So please. Please just listen to what I have to say. Once you've heard me out, I'll let you decide what to do.
</line><line>Woods:
.........

<line>Apollo:
Juniper, you start coughing when you're under stress. You can't hide it from me no matter how hard you try. When you said, "and never causes trouble," a cough escaped and made your scarf flutter. As for why you were stressed, it's because you were lying.
</line><line>Woods:
.........
</line><line>Athena:
Junie, you're trying to hide Hugh's connection to this case, aren't you? And I believe that also ties into a secret about yourself.
</line><line>Woods:
A-A secret? About me? I don't understand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
I already told Juniper. so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.
</line><line>Athena:
What? Why?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Juniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(He ended their friendship after he found out about Junie's secret, which means... Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
You were Prof. Courte's <textEffects>snitch</textEffects>, weren't you?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Newman:
There's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
And while fulfilling that role, you learned something about Hugh you'd rather forget.
</line><line>Woods:
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
</line><line>Athena:
Junie, please. Stop hiding things from me. I hate having to force things out of you like this.
</line><line>Woods:
.........
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. Time to review the evidence and see if I can't prove my hypothesis. I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
Right here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, "Routine Report." I believe this is meant to mean when the snitch would report in to Prof. Courte. I also believe Prof. Courte planned to meet Hugh in private based on the snitch's info. And from their meeting, Hugh must've put two and two together, and figured out your secret. So you see, it all makes sense only if you're the snitch, Junie.
</line><line>Woods:
*sniffle* ...Aaah...! Forgive me... Forgive me, Thena. I... I... *sob* I've been lying to you this whole time! The truth is, I... I suspected Hugh from the start!
</line><line>Athena:
You did? <textEffects>(Now this is surprising...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Woods:
I'm so sorry. I've talked about friendship so much, but I've been a terrible friend.
</line><line>Apollo:
Juniper, I don't have that special kind of hearing that Athena does... ...but I don't need it to sense the pain you're feeling inside. And its intensity is directly proportional to how you feel about your friend. Am I right?
</line><line>Woods:
*sob* Apollo...!
</line><line>Athena:
Please, Junie, tell me why you suspected Hugh. I have a feeling that will be the key to getting to the bottom of this whole case.
</line>



<line>Athena:
We found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it. I didn't know what the number meant at the time, but now that I'm hearing about bribes...
</line><line>Apollo:
...it must mean that a bribe of 120 grand was to be paid in October.
</line><line>Athena:
What's more, take a look at this mark. The same mark is on the pages of Prof. Courte's planner.
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, you're right!
</line><line>Woods:
W-Wait... But would Prof. Courte have that kind of information in her planner? You don't really think the person who was taking the bribe money was--
</line><line>Athena:
It's just a possibility at this point, but it may indeed have been Prof. Courte.
</line><line>Woods:
B-B-But...!
</line><line>Means:
Th-That is impossible! She'd be the last person I'd ever suspect of accepting bribes!
</line><line>Athena:
Like I said, it's just a possibility. <textEffects>(But a rather good one. Maybe their private talk had to do with the possibility of the bribery being exposed. And what started out as a little argument soon got out of hand.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
It's not your fault, Junie. Anybody would've suspected Hugh if they knew what you knew.
</line><line>Woods:
No, I don't believe that alone would've driven him to murder. There's another reason why I suspected Hugh.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(You've got to be kidding me. There's another reason?)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Athena:
Junie... It must've been terrible holding all of that in. But it's going to be okay. I'll get to the bottom of this. And that's my promise from one good friend to another. I'll be defending Juniper tomorrow. If that's okay with you, Prof. Means.
</line><line>Means:
My main concern is whether you can defeat that prosecutor. ...But I won't try to stop you. I will be watching from the gallery. And shall look forward to seeing what sort of results your methods can produce. Good luck tomorrow. Now, if you would excuse me.
</line><line>Woods:
Thena... I'm sorry. I really mean it. I wish I had trusted you from the start. You have to uncover the truth tomorrow. I know you can do it.
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't worry. We already know that the prosecution's key piece of evidence is a fake. And thanks to you, we figured out the motive, too. Let's give this our best shot, Athena. Let tomorrow be the day Juniper walks free!
</line><line>Athena:
I wouldn't have it any other way! <textEffects>(We should be all ready now. What could possibly go wrong this time?! Still... There's this strange, uneasy feeling I can't shake... I'd better be imagining it.)</textEffects>
