<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...)</textEffects> So, is this a bloodstain?
</line><line>Ema:
Uhhhh... It's so... ugh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema, you're shaking.
</line><line>Ema:
It's just... this is my first time seeing real blood!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Scientific investigation in action...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
O-okay, well, we definitely know that this is a bloodstain. But, doesn't something strike you as odd? Scientifically speaking, of course?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's odd about this... scientifically?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
I definitely think so! I mean... Look at all the blood on the sole of the victim's shoe!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's strange! If they fought here, there'd have to be more bloodstains than this.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Uh, h-hey, Mr. Wright! See how I'm marking up <textEffects>the floor plans</textEffects> when we find a blood stain? See... I'm pretty handy to have around, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. That's very... useful information to have.
</line><line>Ema:
I saved up my allowance to buy this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Luminol Testing Fluid information received from Ema.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
We can't be sure that the police will reveal all their evidence in court. Sometimes they fail to mention evidence that doesn't fit with their view of the case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And we'll drag that "<textEffects>hidden evidence</textEffects>" out into the light of day!
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah! It feels like we're really investigating a crime now, doesn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This luminol stuff is going to come in handy.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Hah!
</line><line>Angel:
I wonder how that fluid of yours would react to a nice Deli Box?
</line><line>Ema:
Ms. Starr!
</line><line>Angel:
You only trust your own eyes, hm? Not bad,&#160;you two... This day-old Deli Box is on the house...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, it's just, that kind of lead in doesn't really get my mouth watering.

Yes, but the same detective was also killed at the same time in the Prosecutor's lot.

Ugh... It makes my head hurt.

Well, first things first. I want to check out the crime scene here.

According to the pamphlet, this is the guard station for the evidence room.

It's those cacti! They're so prickly... so imposing! It's hard to think straight.

<textEffects>(If you can't handle the cacti, stay out of the desert...)</textEffects> What I want to know is, if this is a guard station, where is the guard?

I was just wondering what happened to him? A long time ago, when he was helping my sister do cases, he was so nice. He got along so well with my sister, it made me jealous. And... he was nice to me too, back then.

It's the biggest scandal to hit the station in ages! Everything's topsy-turvy.

Listen, pal, all I know is I need me a steak lunch, pronto! Standing around here talking isn't going to fill my belly!

W-wait! Don't leave!

If you want to know more, head on down to the detention center, pal. Questioning should be over, so I figure he's down there having a good cry. Later!

Here, in this blood on the detective's evidence locker.

Let's use the secret weapon we just borrowed!
</line><line>Ema:
Right. Let's get started! First... choose a finger.

A finger...?

Each finger leaves behind a slightly different imprint. So let's choose the finger that will have left behind the clearest print!

Quit procrastinating and choose a finger!

<line>Ema:
Okay. Now it's time to check for prints! Let me show you how it's done.

First, we sprinkle the aluminum powder around.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? How do you do that?
</line><line>Ema:
Just touch the screen... See?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah... it looks like that did the trick.
</line><line>Ema:
The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? How do I do that?
</line><line>Ema:
You just blow With your breath. Imagine you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. See?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wow... that looks like fun! <textEffects>(It might take some getting used to though...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
It's fine! It won't go up your nose or anything. You just pour the powder on thick, and blow away the extra! Those are the basics of fingerprinting, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess I'd better give it a try...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
Aha! You did it! You found one!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... this looks nothing like a fingerprint.
</line><line>Ema:
Hmm... now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What does it mean?
</line><line>Ema:
It think it means... we're out of luck.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Out of luck...?
</line><line>Ema:
The person who left this handprint must have worn <textEffects>gloves</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Don't tell me we've been wasting out time here!
</line><line>Ema:
Hey, calm down. That's just the way it goes sometimes with scientific investigations. But... it does seem a shame. While we're at it, why don't we look for other prints?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Other prints...?
</line><line>Ema:
Looking at the locker door again closely...
</line><line>Ema:
it seems like there are fingerprints outside the bloody handprint as well. Let's see if we can find a clear print!

Huh? How am I supposed to know who it was?
</line><line>Ema:
I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?
</line>


<line>Ema:
Ah hah! So these prints belonged to Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Ema:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You gave me this "so what?" look.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess that's probably because I was thinking "so what?"
</line><line>Ema:
Okay, so we came up with nothing this time, but there's always next time! Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss! You gotta roll with the punches, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks for the sympathy. <textEffects>(Wait... If I remember correctly... there was <span style="color:#E16935">one other handprint</textEffects> in this room. Let's check it out!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Okay, let's check for prints!
</line><line>Ema:
That's the spirit! Oh! But I have to warn you about something first.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Ema:
The area with the blood was wiped away, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We only ended up finding it using chemical means.
</line><line>Ema:
Any prints in that area will have been wiped away too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... right. So... that means <textEffects>no prints</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ema:
Would you say the probability of your hypothesis is high?
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-don't ask me!
</line><line>Ema:
Anyway... We must try to find prints that weren't wiped away.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Prints other than the ones left by the bloody hand...)</textEffects>

Hey, these fingerprints, they...
</line><line>Ema:
Whose are they? Whose!? Is it someone I know?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's Officer Marshall!!!
</line><line>Ema:
Huh? O-Officer Jake Marshall!?
</line><line><textEffects>Marshall's Fingerprints added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Th-that's got to be a coincidence! He's not involved in the crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema. This<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> are decidedly different from Detective Gumshoe's prints.
</line><line>Ema:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:<textEffects>The luminol reaction</textEffects>. The blood and the fingerprints are in the same place.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh... Oh!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So, we have <span style="color:#E16935">Jake Marshall's fingerprints</textEffects>... on a wiped bloodstain!)</span>
</line><line>Ema:
But why would Officer Marshall...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like our investigation is finally turning up some results!
</line><line>Ema:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess this is what you'd call "<textEffects>decisive evidence</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Ema:
I... I don't believe it!
