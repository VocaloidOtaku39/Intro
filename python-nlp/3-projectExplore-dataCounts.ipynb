He said I looked like \\na smart young man. \"So is it a deal?\" \\nI enquired. Two hours later he was gone, \\nwith 60 of my dollars. But I have the \\nmiracle cream...\\nAnd the nominees for Best Actor are: \\nSir Lawrence...... in The Merchant Of \\nVenus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini \\nParty Summer, the Soda Machine Robot \\nin Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in \\nHow Beige Was My Jacket and, instead \\nof the fifth guy - Calculon, for his \\npowerhouse performance in The Magnificent \\nThree.\\nGood evening ladies and germs.  That \\nwasn\\'t a joke, I was talking to Dean \\nStreptococcus.  Now I\\'m not saying Professor \\nFarnsworth is old, but if you consider \\nhis age he\\'s likely to die soon!  Hey \\nRingo, that was the joke. Oh, it\\'s showtime \\nat the Apollo all over again.\\nSo, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That\\'s \\nmore like it! Who\\'s intimidating who \\nnow, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan \\nBank. Deny my credit card application, \\nwill you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theatre. \\nBoo me off stage on open-mike night, \\nhuh? I\\'ll show you!\\nQuiet, please. I\\'ve called you all here \\nto the parlour to watch as I gradually \\nsolve the crime. One of the people in \\nthis room ... is a big murderer!  You \\nsee, the killer left one fatal clue: \\nThis boot print on the Professor\\'s lab \\ncoat.\\nExcuse me, if I might be so bold, I\\'m \\nwilling to offer my services as a bait \\ncritic.  These sardines for example \\nare bland and tasteless.  And these \\ndry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy \\n...  ... very very juicy--\\nStrange.

They\\'re \\ngoing to deactivate all the robots! \\nI don\\'t hear any gasping.\\nLook! Coupons! I can get two oil changes \\nfor the price of one! Now if I could \\nonly afford the one ... and the car. \\nAh, the years! So many memories, so \\nmany strange fluids gushing out of patients\\' \\nbodies--\\nAnd that\\'s how I got my new shell. It \\nlooks just like the shell I threw out \\nyesterday and I found it in the same \\ndumpster, but this one had a live raccoon \\ninside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?\\nThis letter has to be very personal, \\nso I\\'m writing it in my own ink.  (writing; \\nthinking) Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings \\nfrom your long-lost nephew. Norm and \\nSam and Sadie\\'s boy, remember? ...\\nYes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. \\nAnd I did it with pride. For to express \\noneself with doing a thing is the very \\nessence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet \\nand all its wonderful people!\\nListen to me, Fry. Just because you \\nthink you\\'re a robot, doesn\\'t make you \\na robot. After all, I think I\\'m a doctor \\nbut that doesn\\'t make me a doctor. These \\nfancy clothes do!\\nYes biggie. I learned to feel things \\nI\\'d never felt before: Love, jealousy, \\npassion for disembowling. I owe it all \\nto you.  There! I pronounce the operation \\na success.\\nNo! Zoidberg\\'s brother is dead!  funny \\nstory. I just reverted to the age where \\nmy siblings budded from me and my brother \\nNorman split off and jumped in the fountain.\\nAlright, anteater number one, who are \\nyou protecting?  Is it anteater number \\ntwo?  Don\\'t stick your tongue out at \\nme. I need a name!  What? How do you \\nspell that?\\nMy next clue came at 4.15, when the \\nclock stopped. And another came two \\nhours later at 4.15, when I discovered \\nthe murdered body of Amy\\'s dead, deceased \\ncorpse.\\nNice try little boy. You might have \\nyour textbook knowledge and your real \\ndiploma but I have more skill in my \\nlittle claw than you have in your whole \\ncarapace.\\nI thought I understood this world. I \\nthought I was fitting in. But I guess \\nI don\\'t belong on here anymore than \\nI belong on our crappy home planet-- \\nOoh, sorry.\\nHuh? What\\'s this?  A card from my cousin \\nZoidfarb.  Instead of \"Claus\" he writes \\n\"Claws\"! Now that\\'s humorous. Today\\'s \\ncomedians could learn from this card. No one will ever want to mate \\nwith me, not with a puny claw like this. \\nDid you see those other guys? They looked \\nlike giant claws with bodies attached.\\nLook what arrived: My new shell catalogue. \\nSo let\\'s try some on already!  Ah! Muy \\nmacho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido \\nto ruin your drinking water! Dear \\nDr. Jerkberg, if you\\'re reading this, \\nI\\'m already dead. The person who killed \\nme was ... was--  My God! It can\\'t be! \\nThe murderer, it was--\\nEarth. What a planet. On Earth, you \\nenjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, \\nclams enjoy eating a tasty you.  Maybe \\nI\\'m not yelling loud enough. \\nAw, I\\'ll never recombobulate this ship! \\nWhen the Professor finds out, he\\'ll \\ntear me a new cloaca!  Wait! What would \\nthe robot do?  Frame someone.\\nI know that.  Surrender your mysteries \\nto Zoidberg!  Oh no! Professor will \\nhit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then \\nperhaps gifts!  Ow, what? Ohh!\\nNo, it\\'s the ceremony of Claw-Plach, \\nwhere my species fight to the death \\nover matters of honour. Also whether \\nabbreviations count in Scrabble. \\nQuestion: Do you have to have been cryogenically \\nfrozen to get the free -  You didn\\'t \\nlet me finish. I was going to say \"to \\nget the free food.\"\\nDon\\'t mind if I already did. By the \\nway, do you have anymore of this Dom \\nPerignon bubble bath? There was only \\nenough to fill the tub halfway.\\nFellows! Fellows! How about a film we \\ncan all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. \\nIt\\'s about an upside-down world where \\nlobster is slave to clam.\\nIn my experience boxes are usually empty. \\nOr maybe with a little cheese stuck \\nto the top. And one time pepperoni! \\nWhat a day that was!  \\nThat\\'s where I\\'m meeting Uncle Zoid \\nfor lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. \\nNext time you see me, don\\'t be surprised \\nif I\\'ve eaten. I can never repay him \\nhis ten dollars. So I must take the \\nonly honourable path. what the killing \\nmyself.  Here I go already.  Huh?\\nI saw a frilly cake in here you would \\nremember all your life. I know I will. \\nLate at night it haunts me with it\\'s \\nfrosted beauty. \\nAh. Thank you golf slave!  Bah! Rich \\npople wouldn\\'t waste their time on this \\nnonsense! Plus, these eggs are gritty \\nand tasteless!\\nEdna?! Edna, it\\'s me, Zoidberg. Remember? \\nFrom high school?  You used to laugh \\nat me because my face was covered with \\nbarnacles!\\nOne spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls \\nhelp you sleep, but three spoonfuls, \\nyou\\'ll go into a sleep and never wake \\nup! Never!\\nDon\\'t be so hard on yourself, Fry. You \\nlost the woman of your dreams, but you \\nstill have Zoidberg. You all still have \\nZoidberg.\\nOnly $14.99 for a two-record set. Two \\nrecords! Oh Zoidberg, at last you\\'re \\nbecoming a crafty consumer!  Hello? \\nI\\'ll take eight!\\nBender, if you want to sleep in the \\ntent tonight, you\\'re welcome to join \\nme and Hermes for a little \"just friends\" \\nspooning.\\nStop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate \\nthem all! We kept saying \"One more can\\'t \\nhurt\" and then they were gone. We\\'re \\nsorry! Fry you have \\nno nose! Your nose is gone! You have \\nno nose on your face! Where it is I \\ncan\\'t say but on your face it\\'s not!\\nAh, if only they appreciated freedom \\nthis much on my home planet. Wait a \\nsecond! They do! Because this is my \\nhome planet.\\nSo long. I\\'m off to toss this old shell \\nin the dumpster and maybe pick up those \\npotato chips Amy didn\\'t finish yesterday.\\nI\\'m confused, Fry. I\\'m feeling a strange \\nnew emotion. Is it love when you care \\nabout a female for reasons beyond mating?\\nWelcome one and all. I finally figured \\nout how money could make me happy! By \\nusing it to buy my hungry friends a \\nfeast!\\nPolice? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens \\nI have mail order degrees in Murderology \\nand Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot! ...Now I am the most important \\ndoctor at the delivery company where \\nI work. But, sadly, my life is bereft \\nof laughter.\\nThen consider the following lecture \\na bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. \\nBut on my planet, we have to suffer \\nfor it.\\nAha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy \\nportfolio pays off for the hungry investor! \\nOh! I\\'m ruined.  Why? Why?\\nWait! Everyone must know. I broke the \\nProfessor\\'s bottled ship.  And what \\nis worse, I framed my dearest friend \\nFry! \\nThey\\'re all like \"Stop spraying me with \\nink Zoidberg!\" \"Put on pants Zoidberg!\" \\n\"Don\\'t touch our fancy box Zoidberg!\"\\nThe female Leela\\'s problem is purely \\nmedical. Soon she will drop her eggs \\nand they will hatch and all will be \\nwell.\\nThen it was all on purpose. You\\'re lucky \\nto have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross \\nme, and I\\'ll turn on you like that.\\nI\\'m feeling less nuts, thank you, because \\ntomorrow I will be depositing my jelly \\nin the cloacal vents of a female. \\nLove? That word is unknown here. I\\'m \\nsimply looking for a female swollen \\nwith eggs to accept my genetic material.\\nWait! I\\'ll save us! By cutting the unbreakable \\ndiamond filament!  Well, at least I\\'ll \\ndie with my friends. Hello?\\nDeny my freedom, will you? Well we\\'ll \\ndo to you what we did to the Squash \\nMen of the Squash Planet! Squish them!\\nYoung lady, I\\'m an expert on humans. \\nNow pick a mouth, open it and say... \\nWhat? My mother was a saint! Get out!\\nWell it was nice of you to let me reattach \\nyour arm, Fry. Especially after I made \\na complete eel out of myself.\\nYou\\'re both very lucky. I\\'d pay anything \\nto end my miserable loneliness. If only \\nI weren\\'t so desperately poor.\\nStop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating \\ndance the male will become enraged and \\nmaul us with his fearsome gonad.\\nOh, it\\'s wonderful! I don\\'t know anything \\nabout it but they send me a bucket of \\nkrill for every patient I send.\\nWell, uh, editing is a long and expensive \\nprocess but we spent all the money on \\npies, so it\\'ll be ready Friday.\\nMmm, I haven\\'t eaten since Tuesday! \\nBird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry \\nwoven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?\\nYour student loans have been repaid? \\nThen how \\'bout lending your old pal \\nZoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!\\nBah! Your planet doesn\\'t deserve freedom \\nuntil it learns what it is to not have \\nfreedom. It\\'s a lesson, I say.\\nShe\\'s a hateful monster this Morgan. \\nShe scolded and hit me. I tell you she\\'s \\nrisking my friendship with her.\\nWonderful. And while you\\'re under the \\nknife, you could also get an ink pouch \\nto help you escape your enemies.\\nRelax, Fry. I\\'ll simply spin you in \\na high-speed centrifuge separating out \\nthe denser fluid of His Highness.\\nFry, it\\'s been years since medical school \\nso remind me: Disembowelling in your \\nspecies - Fatal or non-fatal?\\nWell, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now \\nthat\\'s a grand old flag!  I wonder what \\nthe Shroud of Turin tastes like.\\nYou? The successor? Over my empty shell! \\nThe Professor will pick me. Only I have \\nhis lobster-like tenacity!\\nFinally, I have a good claw. See?  Three \\nhuman females, a number and a king giving \\nhimself brain surgery.\\nBut comedy is in my valves. My Uncle \\nHarold was a big Hollywood star back \\nin the era of silent holograms.\\nThat\\'s why I love Earth! You can do \\nwhat you want, and no-one makes you \\nfeel guilty because no-one cares.\\nBah! Someday they\\'ll watch! From down \\nin the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg \\ncaresses their fancy box.\\nI used to hang out here as a larva. \\nIt looked so much bigger back then. \\nWho\\'s the tough guy now, Vinnie?\\nSo, it\\'s just as I suspected all along. \\nThe crime is unsolvable!  A letter from \\nBender, my good friend. \\nWhat? It\\'s not even scratch and sniff? \\nBut if rich people think it\\'s good, \\nI\\'ll buy it!  One art please!\\nNo, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody \\nbut you. I\\'m afraid your body was badly \\ndamaged in the crash.\\nThere you are, good as new. Except for \\nyour dorsal fin, I\\'m afraid I couldn\\'t \\nfind it after the crash.\\nWait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, \\nI\\'m desecrating a flag. But to preserve \\nthe freedom it represents!\\nBender, you look awful. I prescribe \\nmake-up. Here. It just so happens I \\nhave my Mary Kay sample case!\\nSo now I\\'m in the gutter? Surrounded \\nby bums who eat garbage. Money brought \\nme no happiness. Bupkiss!\\nIt was starting to get a little cramped \\nin there so I molted, why not? Ah, the \\nfresh air feels good! Yes you can. The beauty was \\nin your heart, not your hands.  The \\nmusic\\'s bad and you should feel bad.\\nGive it to me straight, Professor. Is \\nit fin rot? It\\'s fin rot, isn\\'t it? \\nTell me it\\'s not fin rot!\\nI\\'ve performed a few mercy killings. \\nSo, as long as I\\'m in town I was wondering \\nif maybe ... craw?\\nAnd the winner is... And the winner, \\ninstead of any of the nominees, is the \\nlegendary Harold Zoid!\\nTo induce vomitting, that was the solution! \\nEverywhere it went!  What a Valentine\\'s \\nDay that was!\\nCaptain, I don\\'t think we\\'re on Pluto \\nany longer. In fact, we may have left \\nspace as we know it.\\nIt\\'s funny. You live in the universe, \\nbut you never do these things til somebody \\ncomes to visit.\\nA complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! \\nI would have settled for a hard roll \\nwith ketchup inside! I didn\\'t have the \\nheart to tell him: It\\'s fin fungus. \\nHe\\'ll be floating upside-down by morning.\\nThat\\'s it over there.  Don\\'t worry, \\nI managed to keep your head alive with \\nsome quick surgery.\\nOh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! \\nHas it also appreciated in value?  Please \\noh please!\\nWell I have a lot of experience telling \\npatients bad news so, let me break it \\nto him gently.  \\nCheer up friend. When we get home a \\nhigh quality prosthesis will have you \\nlooking good as new.\\nUh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta \\nspring me. I\\'ll never survive in here; \\nI\\'m too pretty!\\nAmbassador Moivin, you and your staff \\nare so kind. I\\'m truly humbled.  What, \\nno marshmallows?\\nAin\\'t got no cash,\\n\\nAin\\'t got no style,\\n\\nLadies vomit when I smile,\\n\\nBut does Zoidberg worry?\\n\\n\\nI choose my own claws! I want the tactile \\npleasure of chopping him right here \\nin the gonads!\\nI don\\'t like the look of this doctor. \\nI bet I\\'ve lost more patients than he\\'s \\neven treated.\\nSo do you guys know about anything else \\ngoing on, because I\\'m totally still \\nready to party.\\nFor one beautiful night, I knew what \\nit was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, \\nyet honoured.\\nThat leave Best Soft-Drink Product Placement \\nand then Best Actor. We don\\'t have much \\ntime.\\nSo he\\'s not perfect. You don\\'t wanna \\nend up old and lonely like Zoidberg! \\nYou were saying?\\nNone of your beeswax, slave! You\\'ll \\nfind out soon enough. Just focus on \\nglobing that mud. \\nOh what a foolish squid I\\'ve been. I\\'m \\nnot rich! I can\\'t even buy one measley \\nmasterpiece!\\nGoodbye, friends. I\\'ll miss you.  Good \\nriddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the \\npopular one!\\nThis company\\'s circling the drain I \\ntell you. I\\'d sell my stock right now \\nfor a sangwich!\\nNow open your mouth and let\\'s have a \\nlook at that brain.  No no no no no \\nnot that mouth!\\nNot bad for a city boy, huh?  By the \\nway, I took the liberty of fertilising \\nyour caviar.\\nThank you. These\\'ll come in handy for \\nmy new hair.  Finally I look as pretty \\nas I feel!\\nThen if you\\'ll excuse me I see some \\nravioli that only has two shoeprints \\non it.  Three.\\nIs it possible that all this slavery \\nand oppression is shmutzing up our freedom \\nlesson?\\nI ate garbage yesterday and it didn\\'t \\ncost me $300! I\\'m not paying.  Farewell \\ngood sir!\\nThe gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. \\nFor some reason I\\'m frisky as a squid \\non Tuesday.\\nYou know, Fry, I\\'ve got a little place \\njust outside town. You could come visit, \\nmaybe? Of all the slimy, \\ngross crab monsters on this planet, \\nyou are apparently the hottest.\\nMany people dream of a fresh, new look. \\nAnd Mary Kay can make those dreams come \\ntrue.\\nI\\'m all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet\\'s \\nembassy? They\\'re paid to not kill me! \\nA-yoop!\\nNothing, I\\'m leaving. But if you have \\nextra courage I\\'d haul it away for you \\nmaybe?\\nThey come to feast after the frenzy. \\nOnce my species passes on its genes, \\nit dies.\\nHurry up with the water, I\\'m steaming \\nin my own shell I am, it\\'s that hot \\nit is!\\nHe defended my freedom when no-one else \\nwould. He was a good and honourable \\nman.\\nI don\\'t know yet. But I shall attract \\none this afternoon with an erotic display.\\nIt\\'s all so complicated with the flowers \\nand the romance and the lies upon lies.\\nWell don\\'t look into it but I\\'m a respected \\ninternal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!\\nDon\\'t worry, Fry, we\\'ll have your body \\nall fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!\\nCasual hello, it\\'s me Zoidberg, act \\nnaturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! \\nStop!\\nI came as soon as I could.  It appears \\nto be a case of African Hydraulic Fever!\\nAlright, alright, spare me your life \\nstory.  Now what seems to be the trouble?\\n...and they walk up to the bar and then \\n- uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I\\'ve got more! \\n\\nAnd I\\'m the other guy. Courage. Not \\nenough of it. Need some from whatshisname.\\nOh, I don\\'t know, Fry. I think I\\'m too \\npoor to follow a band around in a van.\\nI ask for rich guy stuff and you give \\nme shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu!\\nSo what\\'s the problem? Just get down \\non your claws and do the apology dance.\\nWe crustaceans don\\'t like steam. I\\'m \\ngoing to go work out with the Nautilus!\\nI may not know from emotions but when \\nit comes to medicine, forget about it.\\nLeela, Fry, robot. No matter what it \\nis you\\'re doing tonight, I\\'m available.\\nShe\\'s right, I mean sure they got the \\nBraves but it\\'s a third-rate symphony.\\nSee, this is how it starts. First with \\nhe jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.\\nMaybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him \\nand asked for a few hundred pointers...\\nGracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where \\nwere you on the night of August 23rd?\\nNo. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won\\'t \\nbe responsible for. Zoidberg away!\\nGet ready, Fry. I\\'m going to rip your \\nswim bladder out and show it to you.\\nThis is where you live? I though you \\nwere a big-shot Hollywood movie star.\\nGlad you like them. I\\'ve been making \\nfine jewellery for years, apparently.\\nHmm. We\\'ll need to have a look inside \\nyou with this camera.  Guess again.\\nThe real Lucy Liu! The one you can see \\na movie of in the popcorn stadium! \\nOn Earth, everybody is always looking \\nfor a giant squid. On my planet -\\nPerforming? What? Please, if someone \\ncould spare me money to buy shoes -\\nLet\\'s face it, we\\'re in hot butter here. \\nWe should call Leela for help.\\nI\\'ll have a look, but I remind you, \\nI\\'m an expert on humans not robots.\\nBut she\\'s not. She\\'s merely the female \\nwith the largest clutch of eggs.\\nSure, humans are cute, but how else \\nare we supposed to test cosmetics?\\nThey\\'re tastier than an unguarded penguin \\nnest. What do you call them?\\nCaptain please, have some liquor. You \\nrobots need alcohol to function.\\nSay, this reminds me of that time I \\nate that other watch Kif gave you!\\nVroom vroom! And the winner of the big \\ncar race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!\\nIf only it\\'d worked. You could go back \\nand not waste your time on it.\\nWhat\\'s going on? Is this angry yelling \\nor busted hearing aid yelling?\\nI\\'ve got his scent! Over here where \\nthe water gets warmer. This way!\\nWhat? When did this happen? You\\'re joking, \\nright?  That\\'s not funny! Amy, take of \\nthese rubber bands and I\\'ll show you \\nhow normal I am!\\nI recommend the health cure on Spa 5, \\nthe sauna planet. Here, read.\\nThen it\\'s settled. Hermes will relax \\nand Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!\\nOh, right, right, with the bones! I \\nalways forget about the bones.\\nI\\'ll handle the snipping. Afterall I \\ndo have the proper equipment.\\nAll hail Zoidberg! The king with the \\nbox!  Now it\\'s my turn maybe?\\nGoose liver? Fish eggs?  Pah! Where\\'s \\nthe goose? Where\\'s the fish? You seem malnourished. Are \\nyou suffering from internal parasites?\\nThe frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience \\nin life and I missed it.\\nThe frenzy is over. How will I ever \\nget rid of my male jelly now?\\nQuick! We can escape through that nasal \\ncapillary into the sinus.\\nI can\\'t stop. When I eat too much dirt, \\nI get stuff in my throat.\\nCaptain Brannigan, you\\'re always welcome \\nhere at Rancho Zoidberg!\\nYum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, \\nI\\'m Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!\\nI\\'d love to, but first I have to perform \\nsurgery.  I kid, I kid!\\nDammit Fry! He may have done wrong, \\nbut he\\'s still your captain. Freedom, freedom, freedom, \\noy!\\n\\nFreedom, freedom, freedom, oy!\\n\\n\\nWell, gang, it looks like we have another \\nmystery on our hands.\\nBe careful with Adlai, Leela, he\\'s a \\ndoctor, they\\'re very poor.\\nMmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmellows! \\nOoo and a cherry!\\nUh sorry, I think there\\'s a problem \\nwith your upstairs toilet.\\nAmy, this is for you: A set of combs \\nfor your beautiful hair.\\nYou Latins are so hot-blooded!  This \\none\\'s like a summer guy!\\n...And a rich, respected doctor with \\nmany surviving patients. I\\'ve only been here a day and \\nalready I\\'m a Hollywood phoney.\\nA fortune it is! At last, Zoidberg will \\nlive like a rich man!\\nAlright, so you\\'re nonchalant. Quit \\nrubbing our noses in it.\\nZoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! \\nZoidy want go outside!\\nWhat are you talking about? Everybody \\nremembers Harold Zoid!\\nI\\'ll not only help you find it, I\\'ll \\nhelp you do more to it!\\nYou didn\\'t have to call attention to \\nhis speech impediment.\\nThe President is gagging on my gas bladder! \\nWhat an honour!\\nLook who\\'s here everyone! It\\'s Zoidberg, \\nthe lovable tramp!\\nAlright, alright. Let me have one of \\nyour young on a roll.\\nIt\\'s good cholesterol but it spreads \\nlike bad cholesterol!\\nWhy with all the crying?  So that\\'s \\nwhere I left my shell.\\nSo these three parasitic worms bore \\ninto a human\\'s head...\\nAnd Zoidberg picks up another piece, \\nthe crowd goes wild!!\\nAh, much better. You can take off these \\nrubber bands now.\\nSure, butter me up with candy. But it \\nwon\\'t work sonny!  \\nUncle Zoid, you\\'re looking young enough \\nto be throw back!\\nHmm, serious drama. Perhaps it is time \\nto give up comedy.\\nBoth good, the important thing is I\\'m \\nmeeting new people.\\nThey are mild. In fact, you\\'re soaking \\nin one right now. I\\'d like to propose a toast \\nto ... coat check number 84.\\nIs this what human mating looks like? \\nBecause I like it!\\nBy a scallop\\'s forelocks! What\\'s with \\nall the beer, Fry?\\nSo what are you guys doing tonight? \\nI\\'m up for whatever.\\nIs Bender still missing for a week? \\nWhere is he already?\\nAnd he talked non-stop, like a parrot \\nof the sea he was.\\nDo you have any that aren\\'t so tight \\naround the thorax?\\nReally? I\\'d better keep an eye out at \\nthe next meeting.\\nThe king crab is to die for! Look, a \\ntiny edible crown!\\nNot a day goes by I don\\'t ask myself \\nthe same question.\\nI\\'m no doctor but this machine guy could \\nuse a lozenge.\\nThat pig over there is wearing the same \\nsandals as me.\\nSay, robot, old buddy? Could you help \\nme move a couch?\\nMy whole life I worked on that act. \\nAnd they hated it. The president is dead. Congratulations, \\nMr. President.\\nThey sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory \\njob.  \\nThere\\'s nothing crazy about it. It\\'s \\njust Freedom Day!\\nFine! Just give me something crawling \\nwith parasites. I just wanna talk, it has \\nnothing to do with mating. \\nHow are you doing there, Fry?  Glad \\nto hear it.  Aha!\\nOh the hypochondriac\\'s back. So what \\nis it this time?\\nWhat I\\'m going to revrt through all \\nmy larval stages?\\nI\\'ve had it with this game! I\\'m going \\nfor a scuttle!\\nEnough with the questions. More weight! \\nMore!  More!\\nSuch a man. I\\'d follow him to hell and \\nback I would.\\nYou know, Fry, you could join a third \\nparty, maybe.\\nHmm, this \"love\" intrigues me. Teach \\nme to fake it.\\nCareful, Fry, I think that flag might \\nbe poisonous.\\nTo hell with your spoiled baby, I need \\nthose shoes!\\nBah, big shots. I say let the dice do \\nthe talking.\\nYippie-ki-yay! You\\'ll never guess where \\nI\\'ve been!\\nHost-man! Host-woman! I\\'m having a wonderful \\ntime! Oh Danny-boy! The pipes, the \\npipes are calling...!\\nUh excuse me? Which is the one people \\nlike to hug?\\nAh, I\\'ll just turn the wheel to maximum \\nfastness!\\nCall them what you want. I call them \\na free meal.\\nSo the clover is still in the hiding \\nplace maybe?\\nI hope we all have as much tomorrow \\nat my birth -\\nDid someone say something about a free \\nhot meal?\\nHooray! I\\'m useful! I\\'m having a wonderful \\ntime!\\nThere\\'s no part of that sentence I didn\\'t \\nlike. Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. \\nCashier\\'s cheque. \\nYou didn\\'t do anything. Don\\'t beat yourself \\nup.\\nA fancy dress gala! I\\'ll wear my formal \\nshell.\\nYo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up \\nthe rock!\\nAh, my old scuttling grounds! Let\\'s \\npull over.\\nFriends!

This oughta make me stand out. \\nCraw!\\nWell, I guess this is goodbye for me \\nas well.\\nI learned it from a decongestant commercial. \\n\\nA buffet! Oh if only I had my wallet \\nwith me.\\nAha! Now the rubber band\\'s on the other \\nclaw!\\nI only wish I could have removed the \\nstinger. You\\'re right, my stink gland \\nis weak. Smell! Of course I\\'m being irrational! \\nI\\'m in love!\\nThey said I probably shouldn\\'t be a \\nsurgeon.\\nCongratulations. I assume Amy is the \\nfather. I can\\'t believe everyone is \\njust ad-libbing!\\nEdna, I couldn\\'t stand it any longer. \\nI--   \\nWhen I was two there was a tidal wave \\nin - \"Soothing action, action, \\naction action...\"\\nThe Magnificent Three. Scene one, take \\none. It\\'s been an honour \\nto serve under you sir!\\nFry, look what you did, she won\\'t shut \\nup.\\nIf that\\'s his pizza, then I\\'m icy whatever! Did you \\nhear that? I\\'m going to Hollywood!\\nHooray! Finally you\\'re standing up to \\nhim.\\nHooray, people are paying attention \\nto me!\\nThat stench. That heavenly stench!  \\nMore! Alright, alright, third \\ntime\\'s the charm.\\nThe Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take \\n95.\\nNot if you\\'ve lived a life without regret.\\nTrust me two out of three doesn\\'t cut \\nit!\\nYou, a bobsledder? That I\\'d like to \\nsee!\\nMy slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!\\nHey don\\'t cut that! I need that to speak!\\nMoney doesn\\'t make good people, no siree!\\nI can\\'t spell anything with these cards.\\nI\\'ve heard of that, who said I haven\\'t?!\\nAmbassador Moivin, you killed my lawyer.\\nThe current, its too much already! Help!\\nI\\'m networking. Let me give you my card. Don\\'t wanna talk about anything \\nelse...\\nNo don\\'t hurt him! He\\'s my best friend!\\nOf course! Why didn\\'t I think of that!\\nSame place as your species: The beach.\\nBender, you said \"wink wink\" out loud.\\nDid you see me escaping? I was like \\n-\\nLife was bad but now its good forever!\\nHooray! I\\'m a teenage hearthrob again!\\nSo I guess everything worked out fine.\\nThe doctor is in!  The doctor is out.\\nOn margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!\\nUh, OK. How much do I have to invest? The captain\\'s table! What \\nan honour!\\nPlease sir, I love you like a father!\\nYou kept track of it all these years!\\nCan\\'t I have a scented bath in peace?\\nOh sure like you need all your blood.\\nUh-oh, I shouldn\\'t have had seconds.\\nReally? I though you were the robot. Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!\\nExcuse me, I believe I\\'m the doctor.\\nI\\'m sorry but we couldn\\'t remove it.\\nSorry, you must have been boring me.\\nNo, it\\'s a fabulous, crab-ulous day!\\nThat\\'s where I live. I have no home.\\nI should warn you: I\\'m a mean drunk.\\nI\\'d like a jumbo squid log, please.\\nHmm. Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be fine.  \\nWhat\\'s this? Two meals in one week?\\nHooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!\\nOh the guilt! The unbearable guilt!\\nI can\\'t see from down here I can\\'t.\\nWhat?
