Trucy:
This is it, the big day! Did you get any sleep?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, I went to bed at 1:00 AM or so.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh? What time did you wake up?
</line><line>Apollo:
...3:00 AM.
</line><line>Trucy:
That's only two hours, Apollo... But, at least you have me! ...And the Amazing Mr. Hat!
</line><line>Mr. Hat:
<textEffects>Here's looking at you, kid.</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Good luck today, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Th-That voice...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heya. Get any sleep?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was going out of my mind with boredom, so I signed myself out earlier today. Somehow, that place makes fake piano playing at the Indochine pasta joint seem almost fun.
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy! Do you know who Prosecutor Gavin's witness is today?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a guess!
</line><line>Trucy:
Hmm... How about Little Plum?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! That Sherman tank of a mom? Nope, guess again.
</line><line>Trucy:
That's too bad. You know, speaking of moms... You need to find me a new mommy one of these days, Daddy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's barely morning and you're at it already, Trucy! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(OK, see, this is why I don't buy their "father-daughter" relationship.)</textEffects> So, Mr. Wright! Do you know who the prosecution's witness is?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Alita Tiala. Your client's fiancée.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(She's going to be a witness!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
But that seems odd... Why would she testify against her own fiancé?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have to wonder what Gavin's up to.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Something's going down today, that much is clear!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, not to worry. I've got my panties back. If we can't find a killer, I'll pull one out of there!

<line>
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.
</line><line>Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Prosecution is warmed up, and it's a sold-out house.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, to recap... While yesterday's witness seemed more guilty than any other party...
</line><line>Trucy:
Guilty of panty-snatching!
</line><line>Judge:
We did find out one thing for certain. There were three people in the park at the time of the murder: The witness, the victim, and the defendant.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Correct, Herr Judge. And today, I'd like to do something a little new age. I'd like to look at this horrible crime... from the outside.
</line><line>Apollo:
The "outside"...?
</line><line>Klavier:
The acquisition of the murder weapon... The preparation for the act... Our poor defendant told all, you see. ...To his betrothed.
</line><line>Judge:
His... bee trove?
</line><line>Klavier:
...His fiancée, Herr Judge. His partner for life... with no chance for parole.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, you may show the erm... "lucky" lady to the stand.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
...Your name and occupation, Fräulein.
</line><line>Alita:
Alita Tiala. My occupation... is future wife.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, traditional values! I respect that. Too many brides these days can't even weave baskets blindfolded... underwater. Yet you're here today as a witness for the prosecution?
</line><line>Alita:
To be honest, I didn't want to testify at first. But... I couldn't hide the truth.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Honesty! Another admirable trait.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Fräulein, is it true that, on the day of the crime... ...the defendant, Wocky Kitaki confessed his plans? His plans... for murder?
</line><line>Alita:
...Yes.
</line><line>Judge:
The witness will please give her testimony to the court!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Wocky's Plan --</textEffects></center>
<line>Alita:
It was the day that the family health check-up results came back.
When Wocky found out that Dr. Meraktis had lied, he flew into a rage.
"I'll teach him!" he said. He took one of the Family's pistols...
...And, you already know what happened that night.
I... just don't see how anyone but Wocky could have done it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
So, the pistol did belong to the Kitaki Family, then...
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes. With regards to this, an investigation is underway at the Kitaki mansion... ...on charges of the possession of illegal firearms.
</line><line>Judge:
And the bullet that took the victim's life? Was it...
</line><line>Klavier:
...Fired from the pistol the defendant procured? Yes, this has been proven.
</line><line>Trucy:
How can you prove something like that?
</line><line>Apollo:
Bullets carry marks from the barrel that fired them, called "rifling marks".
</line><line>Trucy:
Rifling marks...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Think of them as being a gun's fingerprint, left on every bullet it fires.
</line><line>Apollo:
And when did you first hear about Wocky's plan?
</line><line>Alita:
It was the day of the murder. I... I should have stopped him! I just didn't think he would actually do it!
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. The defense may begin the cross-examination.

<line>Trucy:
Poor Ms. Tiala... I can't imagine what it would be like to be in her position!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...I'm a little more concerned for her fiancé. Why would she testify against him like this...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala.
</line><line>Alita:
...! M-Me...? But why...
</line><line>Apollo:
You were quite clear when you told the court: You heard about the pistol from the defendant on the day of the murder. In other words, you knew what he was planning.
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
Let me get this straight... You intend to tell us that this lady stole the pistol from her fiancé... ...and killed a man in cold blood on his behalf? I've heard of people doing strange things for love, but this...
</line><line>Judge:
It does seem a bit... unfathomable, to be sure. I'm all for romance, and for supporting your partner in life, to be sure. But I think I would hesitate at murder!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'd hope you'd do more than hesitate!)</textEffects> But what if a different connection could be proven? A <textEffects>connection</textEffects> between the witness and the victim? We might find that she had a <textEffects>personal motive</textEffects> beyond wanting to help her fiancé.
</line><line>Klavier:
Hmm, that would put things in a slightly different light. What possible connection are you suggesting here?
</line><line>Trucy:
You know what I'm starting to think? I'm starting to think that the police never looked inside that safe.
</line><line>Apollo:
I have evidence showing a connection between the witness Ms. Tiala and the victim!
</line>


<line>Judge:
That looks like... a medical chart?
</line><line>Apollo:
Found inside a safe at the Meraktis Clinic. I'd like to draw the court's attention to the names written on the chart.
</line><line>Judge:
...What!? Ms. Tiala! Whatever... Why is your name on this chart!?
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, care to explain the meaning of this, Ms. Tiala?
</line><line>Alita:
...... I'm not sure what you mean by "meaning", Mr. Justice!
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(Our warm little fiancée just froze over!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Alita:
I was on staff at that clinic until half a year ago. It was boring. So I quit. That's all. Is there a problem with that?
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Tiala! You testified that you had no connection to the victim!
</line><line>Alita:
And I don't. Now.
</line><line>Apollo:
"Now"...?
</line><line>Alita:
I quit half a year ago, didn't I? So there's no connection. Let me guess, you're the kind of guy... ...who can't rest until he knows every last detail of his girlfriend's past. Am I right?
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's not true at all! Why, I... I embrace the ones I love, past flaws and all, no matte--
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
"There's no connection now" doesn't fly in a court of law.
</line><line>Alita:
Doesn't... fly?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!)</textEffects> You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But these sandals prove that you remained connected!
</line><line>Alita:
Ah...! W-Well, who knows? I'm sure there are lots of people with those sandals...
</line><line>Klavier:
So sorry, Fräulein, but your act isn't working.
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Your moment of hesitation just now cost you.
</line><line>Alita:
Wh-What's with you? I thought you were on my side!
</line><line>Klavier:
I'm afraid there is no side but that which the evidence supports, Ms. Tiala.

<line>Apollo:
These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby. ...They're yours, aren't they?
</line><line>Alita:
Ah...! W-Well, who knows? I'm sure there are lots of people with those sandals...

<line>Alita:
... Well, now we see your true colors. I was wrong to cooperate with you from the beginning! I just wanted... I just wanted you to help get Wocky back on the straight and narrow.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... This court thinks you need to worry less about Wocky and more about yourself. It sounds as though we need to hear a bit more about your story.
</line><line>Apollo:
Your sandals were found in the entrance to the clinic... Which means you went there on the day of the murder!
</line><line>Alita:
Well, there's little point in denying it.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The witness will tell us about this visit. Why did you go to the Meraktis Clinic that day?
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Meraktis Clinic --</textEffects></center>
<line>Alita:
I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January.
I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol.
The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.
Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets.
I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
By "mistake", you mean... ...the mistake we heard about from the defendant? The botched operation?
</line><line>Alita:
He was a timid, small man... but I never wished him harm. I just thought I should let him know, you know?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That does make sense.
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes, but there is still one thing which does not.
</line><line>Judge:
What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
The sandals left in the lobby, of course. We can assume she wore these sandals to the clinic, ja? Then why did she not wear them home? If it were me, I would have worn them home.
</line><line>Judge:
I would have worn those sandals home, too.
</line><line>Klavier:
So, why were the sandals left behind?
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ack! He pointed out the contradiction before me!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...There's probably a good explanation for this. Right, Ms. Tiala? ...Say, for instance... There happened to be a similar pair of sandals there which you wore home by mistake?
</line><line>Alita:
... Actually, that's right. I'm impressed, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, it is nothing. There is, after all, no other possible explanation. Ja, Forehead?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Oh, what the...! No fair! He's filling the holes in her testimony...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The defense may begin the cross-examination.

</line>


<line>Alita:
<textEffects>Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant. The Kitakis are trying to get out of the business. The health check-up this month was their first ever... ...What did you think when you heard about this?
</line><line>Alita:
Eh? Oh, n-nothing. Why should I think anything?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh? I would think you were positively beside yourself. Because you were afraid. You knew what Wocky's chest X-ray would reveal!
</line><line>Alita:
...Urk!
</line><line>Apollo:
A full half year had passed since the operation. You thought you were home free... ...when the chart came back to haunt you!
</line><line>Alita:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
That's all, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
...... Wh-What just happened? Did... the witness just admit to lying?
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
I sensed it. There was a great "aura" emanating from Herr Forehead. ...Very cool. So, the lady was lying, it seems.
</line><line>Apollo:
That's correct. She said she had no connection to the Meraktis Clinic. But her connection was deep indeed... A bit too deep. If the Kitakis got a hold of this chart with her name... ...she'd be finished. Isn't that right, Ms. Tiala?
</line><line>Alita:
... You guessed it.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I-I did it! I broke her testimony!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Amazing, Apollo! I didn't see it at all! Daddy was right about you!
</line><line>Alita:
Wait!
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Tiala?
</line><line>Alita:
It's true, that chart was bad news for me. That's why I went to meet the doctor that day! But that's all! I told him about Wocky and went home!
</line><line>Klavier:
...It appears this cross-examination is far from over.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Klavier:
She hid the truth from us, this is clear, yet... It is not clear that this truth has anything to do with the case at hand!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The witness will add this to her testimony. And... we'll have a bit more cross-examination.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Grr! I was so close!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
You're still close! Keep on her, Apollo!

You say "nothing happened" in the doctor's office. I disagree. Take a look at this.
</line><line>Alita:
What's that? It looks like a squished-up ball of clay. Kind of like you, actually.
</line><line>Apollo:
This bullet was found in the Meraktis Clinic office. Something did "happen" in that office, Ms. Tiala!

</line><line>Apollo:
Ah, but this was stuck inside the doctor's safe.
</line><line>Klavier:
Inside the safe...?
</line><line>Trucy:
I guess the police didn't check that far.

</line><line>Klavier:
...But there is a problem. How can you say that bullet was fired on that day?

</line><line>Apollo:
Weren't you the one who explained <textEffects>rifling marks</textEffects> to us?
</line><line>Klavier:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
The pistol was taken from the Kitaki Mansion that day. If the marks on this bullet match the murder weapon... ...then that proves a firearm was discharged in that office on the day of the murder!
</line><line>Klavier:
... Not bad, Herr Forehead.
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Have this bullet analyzed immediately!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Thirty minutes later... A report arrives: "The rifling marks on both bullets are identical."
</line><line>Judge:
Well... It seems as though the bullet in the safe was fired from the murder weapon.
</line><line>Klavier:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps the defense would like to state their position?
</line><line>Apollo:
...The bullet in that safe proves one fact: A pistol was fired in that office on that day. And at the time of the firing, the safe was open. The safe which contained the top-secret chart.
</line><line>Judge:
Do you think someone was threatening Dr. Meraktis? In order to open the safe?
</line><line>Apollo:
Only one person was in a position to do such a thing. Our witness, Alita Tiala!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Justice! Where are you going with this? Are you accusing the witness!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Alita Tiala knew about Wocky Kitaki's botched operation! She got engaged to him without telling him about it! As long as that bullet remained in his chest, his days were numbered. What if she married him, and then the bullet finally reached its destination!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Klavier:
That reminds me. Apparently, the Kitakis have been asserting themselves in lawful business practices... They're making quite a great deal of money... a fortune, if you will.
</line><line>Judge:
Nefarious! So she planned to marry him just to get her hands on this fortune?

Yeah! You said... You said you'd... You'd... You'd abuse my Alita!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, I think you mean "<textEffects>accuse</textEffects>"...!
</line><line>Wocky:
Same difference! Well you can't have her! She's mine! It was me! I shot that doctor! Me! He left me to die, so I left him to die, too, there in that park!

</line><line>Wocky:
A... Alita-baby?
</line><line>Alita:
The signature on the chart, the engagement... I mean, come on! It's so obvious. Even for a brainless, spoiled brat such as yourself.
</line><line>Wocky:
Alita...
</line><line>Klavier:
Your honesty is like a breath of foul air, Fräulein.
</line><line>Alita:
Hey, I wasn't getting out of this clean, anyway.
</line><line>Apollo:
So... The Family fortune is what you're really after!
</line><line>Alita:
That's right. I wanted the money.
</line><line>Wocky:
No way! That's wack! I ain't trying to hear that!
</line><line>Alita:
Should have done the wedding earlier. Oh well. ...By the way, can I ask you a question?
</line><line>Apollo:
Who, me?
</line><line>Alita:
I believe you said you were going to abuse me?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Accuse.
</line><line>Alita:
Of what crime, might I ask?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Alita:
Oh, I'm a bad girl. Sure. I got close to that brat because I wanted his money. But he was the one with the pistol. He could've fired it into the safe after I'd already left the clinic.
</line><line>Apollo:
What...?
</line><line>Alita:
I would never do a thing like that. It was definitely that silly brat.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, but...
</line><line>Trucy:
What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Apollo:
T-Trucy...?
</line><line>Trucy:
You had the most to lose if that chart was found!
</line><line>Alita:
...But I didn't have a pistol, now did I?
</line><line>Trucy:
W-Well, you could have taken Wocky's!
</line><line>Alita:
You'd think he'd have mentioned that, no? All I've heard him say is, "It was me! I shot him!"
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
That's only because he's trying to protect you!
</line><line>Klavier:
Sorry to intrude in this lovely conversation...
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
But the two of you are forgetting one critical point.
</line><line>Trucy:
What... What point!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Certainly, the Fräulein wanted that chart. You assume she threatened the doctor into opening that safe. But then... ...wouldn't she have taken the chart?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh...
</line><line>Klavier:
You see? That chart wouldn't have been left in that safe!
</line><line>Trucy:
Ack!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(He... He's right!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Ms. Tiala.
</line><line>Alita:
...Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
It is clear to this court that you are not a very good fiancée.
</line><line>Alita:
Oh, I'm flattered.
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps it's time you told us the truth? Tell us about yourself, including your actions and whereabouts on that day.
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't forget! We've proven that you were at the Meraktis Clinic on the day of the crime!

<line>Alita:
Yes, I went to the clinic that day to speak to the doctor.
I wanted that chart, but I failed to get it. So I went back to the clinic later.
In any case, I didn't shoot him. You don't even have proof I stole that pistol, do you.
And that brat was spotted in the park at the moment of the crime!
Frankly, I don't think it matters if Dr. Meraktis was shot in the temple or not.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You went back "later"...?
</line><line>Alita:
That chart was dangerous, you understand. I needed to get rid of it, that's why I went that day...
</line><line>Klavier:
But you couldn't get the chart then, could you?
</line><line>Alita:
...And later that night, Dr. Meraktis was shot. I heard about the shooting, waited a day, but then I had to go back... ...No easy feat with the cops all over the place.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Ah! Th-That was you!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>*thump*
</line><line>Trucy:
......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Someone's in there!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
A break-in! They left through that window!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
So you were the burglar...
</line><line>Alita:
That was you two? If only I had one more minute... ...then I could have opened that safe and gotten the chart!
</line><line>Judge:
What!? That's trespassing! And brazen, at that!
</line><line>Alita:
Oh, is this a trial for trespassing now? Besides... You can't blame a girl for wanting to protect herself... They are gangsters, you know.
</line><line>Judge:
In any case, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination!

<hr />
<line>Apollo:
The doctor was shot in the right temple, yes?
</line><line>Alita:
So it seems.
</line><line>Klavier:
...Let's review the facts again, shall we? If the killer shot from this location... ...the bullet would've struck our victim square in the forehead. However! The entry wound... ...was in the right temple.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, we heard testimony on this yesterday. At the time of the shooting, the witness was standing here. Just before the gun was fired, he <textEffects>shouted</textEffects>. The victim turned his head to look... and was shot.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
But that testimony was proven to be a lie! Our egregious panty-snatcher, Mr. Stickler, did witness the crime... But he was standing to the <textEffects>north</textEffects>, next to the trash can where he tossed those panties! If Mr. Stickler shouted from this location, the bullet couldn't hit his right temple!
</line><line>Alita:
Silly, silly attorney...
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What...!?
</line><line>Alita:
Do you remember what you had for breakfast that morning?
</line><line>Apollo:
... Do you remember, Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
I always have a glass of milk for breakfast.
</line><line>Alita:
What matters is one thing: The doctor was shot in his right temple. If that's the case, there can only be one explanation! The panties guy was mistaken.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Klavier:
...Then why don't you show us, Herr Forehead?
</line><line>Apollo:
Show you... what?
</line><line>Klavier:
Must I explain everything? Very well, let's recap: If the witness, panties guy, was standing to the north... ...then <textEffects>where was the shooter standing</textEffects>? From what location did the killer shoot the victim?
</line><line>Judge:
But wait! If the witness was standing there... ...how could anyone shoot the victim in the right temple?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Ah ha ha ha ha! I merely laid out the facts for us. It is up to the one possessing the shiny forehead to show us. ...If you can, that is.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wocky Kitaki was standing at the "<span style="color:#E16935">Killer</textEffects>" mark... Wesley Stickler at the "<textEffects>Witness</textEffects>" mark... And of course Pal Meraktis was at the "<textEffects>Victim</textEffects>" mark...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Let's hear what the defense has to say. Where was the killer standing when they shot the victim?
</line>


<line>Klavier:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Apparently, you lack this promised evidence.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ugh... That wasn't it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
You'll never succeed if your base assumption is faulty. Perhaps you should rethink this from the top, ja?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Maybe he's right...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
In fact, you may want to rethink your choice of career.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hey, that was a bit uncalled for, don't you think!?)</textEffects> Your Honor, the defense would like to reconsider!

<line>Apollo:
As the facts stand now, we can't explain this crime... ...without contradicting ourselves at some point. But I know why. The real killer shot from an entirely different location!
</line><line>Alita:
What are you talking about!? I don't see any other place...
</line><line>Judge:
Apparently, Mr. Justice does. ...Let's hear it. Where in the park did the killer shoot the victim from?

It's time to raise the roof! ...And the stakes.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh?

Penalties are such frightening things, don't you think? But what if they were a bit more... terrifying? ...Like so.
</line><line>Judge:
D-Double penalty?
</line><line>Klavier:
Herr Forehead wishes to take us in a new direction? Then he must be ready for the challenges ahead!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Challenge accepted. <textEffects>(It's Justice time!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
A-Are you sure, Apollo?

<textEffects>(The key is the witness, Mr. Stickler's testimony! If we believe that, and we know where he stood... ...and the victim turned when he shouted... ...there's only one place the killer could have been!)</textEffects> <textEffects>The killer shot the victim from... here!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude... ...to Ms. Alita Tiala.
</line><line>Alita:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Apollo:
Thanks to you, we had a chance to review the crime... ...and this time, we were prepared. We know that Wesley Stickler was telling the truth! We should have listened to him from the beginning. Wesley Stickler was standing next to the trash can when he saw the two men. ...He shouted, just as he told us in his testimony. ...And the victim turned to look in his direction. A shot was fired! The victim was hit in the <textEffects>right temple</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh no...
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh yes! Which direction was his right temple facing at that moment? That's right! Toward the noodle stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! S-So you're saying... ...the killer was <textEffects>inside the noodle stand</textEffects>!?

</line><line>Klavier:
...Let's think about this a bit more, shall we? You say the killer was "inside the noodle stand". Which would mean the victim, Dr. Meraktis came to the park... ...wheeling his own murderer in the cart behind him!

</line><line>Apollo:
That's... That's just dumb!
</line><line>Klavier:
One more thing. A noodle stand is typically cluttered with the tools of the noodle-making trade. There's no room for a person to ride in there!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... You have a point. Could someone have hidden in that stand?
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! I think I might be on to something!
</line><line>Apollo:
...?
</line><line>Trucy:
I think I've figured out one of our pieces of evidence! In order to make room in the stand, some things would have to be...
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have proof that someone could have hidden in the stand?
</line><line>Apollo:
I can prove one thing. Someone did <textEffects>scheme</textEffects> to clear space in that stand!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
This is a noodle bowl from the stolen Eldoon's Noodles noodle stand.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, and what about it?
</line><line>Apollo:
We discovered a large quantity of these bowls yesterday... ...in the lobby of the Meraktis Clinic!
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
A large quantity of noodle bowls in the victim's clinic?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon was very clear about those bowls.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Guy:
Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Yet the bowls were removed! That night, <textEffects>there was space</textEffects> inside that noodle stand! Space created at the Meraktis Clinic, no less. Right around the time that you were there, Ms. Alita Tiala!
</line><line>Alita:
Stooooooooooooop! I won't listen to any more of these wild fantasies! No... not fantasies... They're worse lies than that spoiled brat's pickup lines!
</line><line>Judge:
I would like to remind the witness of her current status. This court does not consider you entirely innocent.
</line><line>Alita:
Show me an innocent... I'll show you a fairy tale.
</line><line>Judge:
...In any case. The defense has, somehow, made its point. The witness had both a motive and an opportunity to kill Dr. Meraktis.
</line><line>Alita:
More fairy tales! This whole trial is a fairy tale!
</line><line>Judge:
Then please, pull us back down to reality, Ms. Tiala. I'm giving you one last chance to explain yourself.

That night, I went to ask Dr. Meraktis for the chart.
I had no intention of ever letting that chart fall into the Kitaki Family's hands.
But Dr. Meraktis didn't understand...
For some reason, he thought the Kitakis had sent me!
So I gave up and went home... All I did was talk to him!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
You knew about the botched operation... So you tried to get rid of the chart, to save yourself!
</line><line>Alita:
I won't make excuses. ...And I did warn the good doctor. I gave him a chance. I told him that brat got his health check-up report. ...And that he was coming to settle the score.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well. Mr. Justice, begin your cross-examination.

<line>Alita:
<textEffects>I had no intention of ever letting that chart fall into the Kitaki Family's hands.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Alita:
<textEffects>But Dr. Meraktis didn't understand...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Alita:
<textEffects>For some reason, he thought the Kitakis had sent me!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Alita:
<textEffects>So I gave up and went home... All I did was talk to him!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...This is my last chance!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo... any word from your bracelet?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, actually... <textEffects>(I felt it <span style="color:#E16935">respond</textEffects>...!)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
I couldn't see a thing! It's up to you, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Time to <span style="color:#E16935">perceive</textEffects> the truth! ...Here comes Justice!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
"All I did was talk"... and lie.
</line><line>Alita:
Wh-What? Show me proof!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'm pretty sure about this one... I think I'm getting the hang of this. A little slip in confidence, and they give it all away.)</textEffects> The proof... is you, Ms. Tiala.
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
"All I did was talk to him", you claim... Yet you can't hide your own nervous twitch when you say those words!
</line><line>Alita:
My "twitch"? What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Apollo:
You have a <textEffects>habit</textEffects> of scratching the area of your neck around the edge of your scarf.
</line><line>Alita:
Wha--! Wh-Wh-What!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(This is working better than I'd hoped! Her unconscious actions tell the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects> she won't say. <textEffects>Habits</textEffects> and <textEffects>lies</textEffects>... Two dots... Connect the dots and find the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Alita:
D-Don't look at me like that! I t-told you the tr-truth...
</line><line>Apollo:
It seems that when you recall what really happened in that office... ...you can't keep your hands off your neck, can you?
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hmm... It seems that <span style="color:#E16935">nervous habits</textEffects>... ...are <textEffects>unconscious reactions</textEffects> that manifest when someone is trying to hide something!)</span> You can't hide behind your scarf, Ms. Tiala! Something happened between you and the victim in the Meraktis Clinic office!
</line><line>Alita:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>And I've got proof that shows exactly what happened!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Alita:
Wh-What's that...?
</line><line>Apollo:
...You're touching your scarf again.
</line><line>Alita:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
...There's something unusual about this lamp. The bulb is broken... and there's a red splotch on the cord.
</line><line>Alita:
Eh...
</line><line>Apollo:
Seeing how you hide your neck... I think I can come up with a plausible explanation for the lamp's state.
</line><line>Alita:
Well spit it out! This talking in circles nonsense is killing me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Very well. The answer is very simple. Ms. Alita Tiala... Please remove your scarf!
</line><line>Alita:
! ........................ Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!

</line><line>Klavier:
This is a trial to determine what happened in that park. Yet we seem to have drifted off target.
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
We'll find out soon enough if we're drifting... As soon as the witness removes her scarf.
</line><line>Alita:
I... I won't do it! This is insane! I'm a... an unrelated third party! You can't order me to remove my clothing!
</line><line>Judge:
...Ms. Tiala. I'm afraid you've forgotten what's already been proven.
</line><line>Alita:
What...?
</line><line>Judge:
You're hardly "unrelated". ...Please remove your scarf.
</line><line>Alita:
No. Nooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Apollo:
...I knew it. So I was right, wasn't I, Ms. Alita Tiala!
</line><line>Judge:
Your neck... That isn't what I think it is!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Something did happen that night at the Meraktis Clinic! You needed to get that chart back, no matter what it took. Even if you had to steal your fiancé's pistol to do it!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But wait! Looking at this lamp, and the witness's neck... It looks like the very opposite happened!
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. The victim in the clinic that night... ...was this witness! Specifically... ...you tried to threaten Dr. Meraktis and he attacked you! <textEffects>That's what happened</textEffects> that night at the Meraktis Clinic!
</line><line>Alita:
Urk......!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek......................................................
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Will someone please tell me what really happened!?
</line><line>Alita:
I told you the truth already! I went to the clinic that night to warn Dr. Meraktis!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Alita:
...That gangster knows everything! He's coming for you!
</line><line>Meraktis:
...Looks like my clinic's seen its last patient.
</line><line>Alita:
We have to get rid of that chart! Quick, open your safe! Give it to me!
</line><line>Meraktis:
...So you can save your own skin?
</line><line>Alita:
What...?
</line><line>Meraktis:
I know what you're up to. You want in with the Family... And if they see that chart, you're finished.
</line><line>Alita:
......
</line><line>Meraktis:
...Leaving me holding the short straw. But if I'm going down... I'll want some company. You!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
And what happened next!?
</line><line>Alita:
He jumped at me, and knocked me to the floor! Then, he took that cord... ...Pal Meraktis was serious. Deadly serious. He really tried to strangle me. I... I must have blacked out.
</line><line>Judge:
So... you were the victim!
</line><line>Klavier:
And the <textEffects>red splotch</textEffects> on the cord... was your lipstick.
</line><line>Alita:
I... I didn't want to remember that night. That's why I didn't bring it up. There... Are you happy now?
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh...
</line><line>Alita:
I was out cold, almost killed! And you claim I then snuck into that noodle stand... But how could I!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Aaaaaaack!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, one thing is clear. We now know what really happened at the Meraktis Clinic. And it would seem that our victim was not entirely without blame himself!
</line><line>Alita:
I... I'm sorry. I get so nervous just thinking of it, it's hard to breathe. I've told you everything. Can I go home now?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... You bear some responsibility for events that day, true. Yet, if you were also a victim... ...this court would owe you some sympathy. ...Well, Mr. Justice? I believe this clears up the remaining questions for Ms. Tiala.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(When did this happen!? Suddenly, everyone's sympathizing with her!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
I don't know what to think anymore, Apollo... I mean, is that it? Do we know everything we need to know about Ms. Tiala?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well! This finishes the cross-examination of this...
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
Heh. Heh heh heh. Not so fast. This party's just getting started! Now, we rock!
</line><line>Apollo:
W-What!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Those spikes on your head are softer than they look... Or do you not have the stomach to go all the way?
</line><line>Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Pal Meraktis choked Alita Tiala... ...She fell unconscious. But what happened next?
</line><line>Trucy:
He's right! There is more we don't know!
</line><line>Apollo:
But... she was choked hard enough to leave that mark! She would have been out for a while!
</line><line>Trucy:
Even still, what if it was her in that noodle stand!
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(Alita Tiala, half-dead... Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand... And a bullet fired from inside the noodle stand...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
What if it's all true!? We might have already figured out <textEffects>what truly happened</textEffects> that night!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ms. Alita Tiala, as you can see... ...we're not through with you just yet.
</line><line>Alita:
...You really want to blame me for this murder, don't you? You, too, "Prosecutor" Gavin.
</line><line>Klavier:
Me? Fräulein, I only wish to know the truth.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, let's go back over what we've learned up till now. On the day of the murder, Wocky saw his check-up report. ...From which he learned about the bullet still inside him. So, he took a pistol from the Family stash... ...with the intent to give Dr. Meraktis some of "his own medicine".
</line><line>Trucy:
And Ms. Tiala heard about this from Wocky. So she went to the Meraktis Clinic ahead of him! ...In order to get rid of the chart with her signature!
</line><line>Apollo:
But then... something happened.
</line><line>Alita:
...Sounds like you've figured it all out. But remember, I was the victim! I was out cold.
</line><line>Apollo:
But, what about Dr. Meraktis?
</line><line>Klavier:
That does seem to be the problem... He had just strangled Alita Tiala, perhaps, he thought, to death. What did he do after his crime?
</line><line>Alita:
I was just knocked out! Not dead!
</line><line>Klavier:
From the state of his clinic, and the scene in the park... ...I think it's clear what the good doctor did next. Well, Herr Forehead? Care to guess?
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? What did Dr. Meraktis do!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Maybe he did think he killed Alita Tiala... Do I have evidence to show what he did next...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
...As his next move, Dr. Meraktis... ...stole Guy Eldoon's noodle stand!
</line><line>Alita:
What, "killing" me disturbed him that much? So much he randomly stole a noodle stand!?
</line><line>Apollo:
It wasn't so "random". Remember all the bowls in the clinic's foyer? Bowls that belonged inside that stand? I think it's pretty obvious, don't you? That stand was at the clinic. However, the question is why did he remove the bowls?
</line><line>Trucy:
Maybe... because the stand was heavy?
</line><line>Apollo:
Or he wanted to put something in the stand in their place...
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... Wait, you don't mean...!
</line><line>Apollo:
I do. Dr. Meraktis did replace those bowls with something... ...your "<textEffects>corpse</textEffects>", Ms. Tiala!
</line><line>Alita:
M-My "corpse"!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Dr. Meraktis panicked. He thought he'd killed you...
</line><line>Klavier:
...His next move would be to dispose of the body!
</line><line>Alita:
Th-That's crazy talk! You're all crazy!
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
Then let's think about it... logically. The doctor had a <textEffects>place</textEffects> to dispose of you in mind... ...But on the way there... ...who should he run into but the defendant, Wocky Kitaki!
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
...I question your "logic".
</line><line>Judge:
What's this, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
The park is a dead end. Why would he head in that direction to begin with?
</line><line>Alita:
That's right! He had no reason to go there! ...Oh, now I get it! It was a trick! That spoiled brat made him do it! He made the doctor steal the stand!
</line><line>Apollo:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Apollo:
Tell me... Why would someone go to a "dead end"? ...Unless the park was his <textEffects>destination</textEffects>!
</line><line>Alita:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Judge:
Apparently, the defense has an idea. Tell us <textEffects>where</textEffects> Dr. Meraktis was heading with the stand! Here, please show us on this diagram. <textEffects>To where exactly was the victim dragging that stand?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
There? That's a... a river!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. I scarcely need to explain why.
</line><line>Klavier:
...A perfect place to dispose of a body.
</line><line>Alita:
H-He was going to throw me into that river!?
</line><line>Klavier:
He didn't have many other options, Fräulein.
</line><line>Alita:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
I believe this clears up all of the remaining questions. The victim pulling the stand, and the defendant before him. ...And inside the stand, you, Ms. Alita Tiala.
</line><line>Alita:
Urk...
</line><line>Apollo:
And then, the denouement. Wesley Stickler, of panty-snatching fame, walks up. Seeing the two men, he shouts! In that instant...
</line><line>Alita:
So... I shot him?
</line><line>Apollo:
You were the only one who could have stolen Wocky's pistol. It had to be you!
</line><line>Judge:
...Well, Ms. Tiala?
</line><line>Alita:
...... Hmph. ...Nice work.
</line><line>Apollo:
...You mean, I'm right?
</line><line>Alita:
I mean you've done a fine job dreaming up a story... ...to get that spoiled brat off the hook!
</line><line>Trucy:
You're the one who's dreaming! Apollo's backed up everything he's said with facts! If you're so sure he's making it up, give us another reason! Why was Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand through the park!?
</line><line>Alita:
Who knows? But there's one gaping hole in your logic. I think Mr. Gavin knows whereof I speak!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whereof what!? <textEffects>(I can't believe she's still trying to deny this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Is this true, Prosecutor Gavin?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Must I always be the one to point out Herr Forehead's errors?
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(Ack, maybe there really is something!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
I believe the Fräulein speaks of... Herr Doktor's car.
</line><line>Apollo:
His car...?
</line><line>Alita:
That's right! The Meraktis Clinic has that big garage!
</line><line>Judge:
In which sat... a green sports car, was it?
</line><line>Alita:
Why would he steal the stand in the first place!? If he wanted to carry a body, he would have used his car!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack...!
</line><line>Klavier:
And so we find our victim without probable cause to steal that stand... ...and our defense without a case.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Trucy:
Um... I have an idea! You know that green car? I bet it wouldn't run! It was broken!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, what an excellent counter-argument, Fräulein. Too bad you're quite wrong.
</line><line>Trucy:
Eh...
</line><line>Klavier:
Don't tell me you've forgotten what happened to your daddy?
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Th-That's right...! That night, the car that hit Mr. Wright... ...was that green sports car!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, yes! I-I'd nearly forgotten about it!
</line><line>Klavier:
Afterward, he drove it back to that garage. It ran fine.
</line><line>Alita:
...That's right. So why didn't he use his beloved sports car, hmm?
</line><line>Apollo:
Urk...!
</line><line>Klavier:
A glaring contradiction, to be sure. More glaring than your forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
No... Nooooooooooo!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Well, Mr. Justice? Why didn't Dr. Meraktis use his car to carry the "body"?
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh... Umm...
</line><line>Klavier:
Is that a groan of surrender I hear?
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Some advice: Now's a good time to review all you know. ...Everything you've learned over the last two days.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Everything I've learned...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, this contradiction casts doubt on your entire case! This is truly your last chance! The defense will explain to us what happened that night!
</line>



<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I have an idea... It's all coming together!)</textEffects> ...That night, Dr. Meraktis couldn't use his car.
</line><line>Alita:
Hah! Now you're making even less sense than usual!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Not according to my information, Ms. Tiala. Put one and one together, and the explanation is simple!
</line><line>Judge:
If it's so simple, perhaps you can show us some evidence? Show us proof why the car wouldn't run that night!
</line>


<line>Judge:
Let's see now... Panties!? Again!?
</line><line>Trucy:
All sorts of things come out of my panties! ...Even the truth.
</line><line>Alita:
...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Another crime was committed the night of the murder. The theft of these panties! The latest in a string of similar thefts, actually. But that night, the snatcher was caught in the act! A brave young girl chased the thief until they hid... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage.
</line><line>Alita:
Wh-Whaaat!?
</line><line>Apollo:
The snatcher hid the panties there before running... ...Perhaps someone in this court remembers where he hid them?
</line><line>Judge:
Why... weren't they found in the car's exhaust pipe?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Exactly. By the way, I learned something yesterday... ...A very important piece of information. ...And I learned it from you, Prosecutor Gavin!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
Um, so you were here investigating?
</line><line>Klavier:
And I was on my way home... when my hog gave up the ghost.
</line><line>Apollo:
Your hog...?
</line><line>Klavier:
My motorcycle won't start. A <textEffects>clogged exhaust pipe</textEffects>...
</line><line>Trucy:
Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that!
</line><line>Klavier:
Cars, motorbikes, they're all the same. Clog the exhaust, <textEffects>and they won't run</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Alita:
My, how interesting.
</line><line>Apollo:
While Ms. Tiala and the doctor were struggling... ...the panty-snatcher snuck into the Meraktis garage. From that time, until the time we found these... ...that car wouldn't start.
</line><line>Alita:
Wh...What...!?
</line><line>Trucy:
That's why Dr. Meraktis had to use the noodle stand! It was the next closest thing he could think of!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Well, Ms. Tiala? This wraps your doubts up quite nicely, I think!
</line><line>Alita:
... So it does.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Alita:
<textEffects>(Where... Where am I...? So dark... Can't see... ...Cramped...! The pain... my throat's burning...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Meraktis:
Wh-What's your problem!?
</line><line>Wocky:
You, Doc! I know what you did!
</line><line>Meraktis:
Ah...!
</line><line>Alita:
<textEffects>(...Wocky?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Wocky:
...You lied to me! So you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, man!
</line><line>Meraktis:
W-Wait! Let me explain!
</line><line>Wocky:
F-Fine. I'll give you your last request.
</line><line>Meraktis:
Listen, you're being tricked! But not how you think! It's not just me...
</line><line>Alita:
<textEffects>(No...! He'll ruin everything! ...I have to stop him!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Stickler:
C-Cease this at once, y-y-you two!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Alita:
Funny. This isn't the way it was supposed to turn out. Oh well. Too bad.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
There's still one mystery... How did you manage to disappear from that stand?
</line><line>Alita:
In the silence after the shot, I heard the witness running...
</line><line>Klavier:
I believe we heard as much from Wesley Stickler. He went to use a public phone to inform the police.
</line><line>Alita:
...Which is when I made my escape.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Which is when you left that slipper print!
</line><line>Alita:
Dr. Meraktis didn't bother taking my slippers off. I threw them out after I stepped in that paint, though.
</line><line>Apollo:
...That was your mistake.
</line><line>Alita:
No. My biggest mistake... ...was coming to you for help, Mr. Justice!
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh...
</line><line>Alita:
I believed in you! You and your "Anything Agency"... If anyone would get Wocky declared guilty it was you!
</line><line>Apollo:
...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I believe we've reached a conclusion of sorts. ...Prosecutor Gavin. How is Ms. Alita Tiala doing?
</line><line>Klavier:
She's confessed to everything. We're processing her arrest now.
</line><line>Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin sure seems calm for someone who just lost...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I think he already knew... He'd figured out she was the killer a while ago...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
Some advice: Now's a good time to review all you know. ...Everything you've learned over the last two days.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(He lost... but I didn't exactly win, either.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...Hmm? Something the matter, Herr Forehead?
</line><line>Judge:
Looks like it's time to announce a verdict...
</line>

Trucy:
Great job, Apollo! You did it!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, we did, somehow...
</line><line>Trucy:
Wocky's off the hook... ...free to become the gangster he's always wanted to be! And he has you to thank...
</line><line>Wocky:
Hey! Attorney-man! You're gonna pay for what you did to my Alita, homes!
</line><line>Trucy:
...Or to blame, I guess.
</line><line>Wocky:
You give my Alita back! Stupid pointy-head attorney with a death-wish!
</line><line>???:
Enough, Wocky!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah! Mr. Kitaki...
</line><line>Big Wins:
...It's high time you opened your eyes, Wocky.
</line><line>Wocky:
What do you know, old man! I think it's 'bout time you opened yours! Givin' up the life, tryin' to become some kinda businessman!
</line><line>Big Wins:
Don't talk about what you don't understand, Wocky!
</line><line>Trucy:
...I'm afraid the guard is going to throw them both out.
</line><line>Apollo:
...If not in jail. Wouldn't that be a happy ending.
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, maybe we can help them out! We know <textEffects>why</textEffects> Mr. Kitaki needs to make so much money... Maybe we should tell Wocky. Oh, Wocky? Apollo has something to tell you!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? I do? <textEffects>(Way to put me on the spot...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Wocky:
Eh? Whazzat?
</line><line>Trucy:
Show him the reason why, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Why is Mr. Kitaki trying to become a business man...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Big Wins:
...I searched the globe. And I found one. A doctor who can take that bullet out of you, Wocky. But it's an expensive procedure.
</line><line>Wocky:
M-Man! B-But you got plenty of money already, don't you?
</line><line>Big Wins:
I won't use it.
</line><line>Wocky:
...!
</line><line>Big Wins:
It was the gangster life that did this to you, Wocky. ...I want to help you, and I want to do it clean. Please understand. Wocky...
</line><line>Wocky:
D-Dad... M-Man, I see how it is, old man! Always you looking out for... out for...
</line><line>Trucy:
Wocky...?
</line><line>Wocky:
Listen good, old man! One day... One day... I'm gonna take you out! Then we'll see who's the O.G.! You try to hide in your business suit, I'll find you! Stupid ol' geezer!
</line><line>Trucy:
My! Wocky!
</line><line>Big Wins:
...No, it's as it should be.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Kitaki! <textEffects>(I liked him more without the puppy dog eyes.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Big Wins:
I'm glad... to have met you. I'm not so good with words... But I know a professional job when I see one. Thank you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Who? Me? I don't think...
</line><line>Big Wins:
Someday... I'll bake you one of our latest... The Kitaki Lime Pie.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...He's opening a pie shop!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Big Wins:
...So long.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(And he was gone...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, let's head back, Apollo! To the Wright Anything Agency!
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, since when do I work at your agency!?
</line><line>Trucy:
Aw, we make a good team! Don't just stand there, let's get going!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Huh... Why not. She did help me out. And there's a few questions that still need answers... Like this power of mine that she showed me... And my <span style="color:#E16935">bracelet</textEffects>... If anyone can help me figure it out, it's her. Though I can't say I care much for what her father has become...)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, that's right! We have to go someplace first!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Where?
</line><line>Trucy:
Why, to claim our reward from Mr. Eldoon!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Ah, salty noodles. Right. He got his stand back already?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, and after that, you can come see my show! With a special appearance by the Amazing Mr. Hat!
</line><line>Mr. Hat:
<textEffects>Oh, it's special alright!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Please... anything but him.
