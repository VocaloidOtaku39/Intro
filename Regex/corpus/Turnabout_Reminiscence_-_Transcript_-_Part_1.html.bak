<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...It's almost time for me to enter the courtroom. And so, it is that my first assignment as a prosecutor will be... ...as a replacement for a prosecutor who has been accused by the defendant.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! ...Sir.
</line><line>???:
Have you read over all of the documents regarding this trial?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, sir. I've memorized everything there is to know.
</line><line>Manfred:
Very good. The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is just about complete. Edgeworth... always bear in mind that as your mentor, I, Manfred von Karma... ...will accept nothing short of perfection.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I understand, sir. To have the chance to stand in court at such an early stage in my career... ...I am honored and proud.
</line><line>Manfred:
As I have watched over your studies, I am giving you this very rare chance. Prove yourself. Crush the defendant's pathetic lies into oblivion.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........Yes, sir! <textEffects>(That such a legendary prosecutor is watching over and judging my performance... ...I have to perfect in every way!)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
If it's true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy... ...what could he or she have been better?
</line><line>Manfred:
Hmph... No doubt to steal any suspicious accounting records and release them publicly. Or, more likely, to steal secrets from the Cohdopian Embassy itself... ...since the item that the Yatagarasu stole from there was sent to the police.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What was it that the Yatagarasu sent to the police?
</line><line>Manfred:
...I don't know the details. Anything related to the Yatagarasu is getting the top-secret treatment. Still, I find it very ironic. By returning the stolen item to the police, it was proof positive that the Yatagarasu... ...had infiltrated the embassy on the same day the staff member was killed. Criminals have a way of incriminating themselves, wouldn't you say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That would have to be the first time the Yatagarasu has left evidence behind, correct?
</line><line>Manfred:
Yes, indeed. If you wish to learn more about the Yatagarasu, then I suggest you ask Faraday.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday...?
</line><line>Manfred:
He happens to be the prosecutor in charge of the Yatagarasu case, as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's the prosecutor in charge of both the KG-8 Incident and the Yatagarasu case? Mr. Faraday really has a lot on his plate...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Manfred:
...What is it, little girl?
</line><line>???:
......... ...You're scary, mister.
</line><line>Manfred:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you need something?
</line><line>???:
Umm... I want to trade these coins with you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A fistful of dimes, quarters, and pennies... but it looks like you've exactly a dollar. Is this what you want?
</line><line>???:
Thanks! That's exactly what I needed!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could that child be here to watch the trial?
</line><line>Manfred:
How disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!?
</line><line>Bailiff:
The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is complete!
</line><line>Manfred:
Why you! Do you even know how much time there is left before the trial resumes!?
</line><line>Bailiff:
I... I-I'm so sorry!
</line><line>Manfred:
I can have you mopping up this courthouse instead of protecting it in an instant!
</line><line>Bailiff:
! *gulp*
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's no bother, sir. Not being completely prepared could prove to be a prefect handicap for me.
</line><line>Manfred:
Hmph. A proud one you are. You had better collect the evidence from Faraday and prepare yourself. It's time for your debut, Edgeworth!

</line><line>Manfred:
Just what is going on!? Why isn't Faraday here yet!? How is it possible that the defense is not prepared yet, either!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Bailiff... Where is Mr. Faraday?
</line><line>Bailiff:
I-I'm not sure... I wasn't really paying attention...
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, you must be the one Mr. von Karma recommended... I hear this will be your first trial. I look forward to seeing how you perform. Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sir, it looks like the trial is about to resume, however...
</line><line>Manfred:
...Yes, it will be all but impossible to prove the witness a liar... ...without the evidence from Faraday! What is that balsted buffon up to!?
</line><line>???:
I-I-It's an emergency, siiiiiirs!
</line><line>Judge:
S-Silence!
</line><line>Manfred:
There shall be no yelling in this sacred hall of law! Bailiff! Remove that man from this courtroom at once!

</line><line>Bailiff:
Ms. Yew! There is someone here who wishes to see you...
</line><line>Yew:
......Who is it?
</line><line>Bailiff:
A Cohdopian Embassy staff member by the name of Manny Coachen.
</line><line>Yew:
Wh--!
</line><line>Badd:
.........!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What's going on? Detective Badd and Ms. Yew's moods just changed all of a sudden. Wait a second... Wasn't Manny Coachen...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Yew:
I'll be right there.
</line><line>Coachen:
It's nice to see you again... Ms. Yew.
</line><line>Yew:
Why are you here? I have no desire to ever see you again.
</line><line>Coachen:
Now, now... Actually, would you mind stepping outside for a brief chat?
</line><line>Yew:
........Fine. Let's go.
</line><line>Manfred:
...Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
Von Karma...? It's been a long time.
</line><line>Manfred:
I knew you would show up. You usually do when the Yatagarasu is involved, and I see this case is no exception.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you know Detective Badd, sir?
</line><line>Manfred:
Yes. He's like an old bloodhound that never leaves the scene of a crime. If only he would get a promotion and move on.
</line><line>Badd:
It's the crime scene where a detective is most useful and effective.
</line><line>Manfred:
Hmph! It's not like I don't know that. Moving on though, Badd. The man that I just passed by... ...was he not the suspect from the KG-8 Incident!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So I was right...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Manfred:
Just what is that man doing, wandering around here!? That Faraday... I can't believe he let such an easy catch get away! Imbecile! I would've proved his guilt in three minutes!
</line><line>Badd:
Von Karma! ...I think you've said enough for now. It's in poor taste to speak like that about the departed.
</line><line>Manfred:
Hmph...Very well. Back on topic... I'm placing Edgeworth in charge of the investigation here...
</line><line>Franziska:

</line><line>???:
Papa! How can you place him in charge!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska... What are you doing here?
</line><line>Franziska:
I'm here for summer vacation, what else?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Franziska von Karma... So she is here on vacation from Germany... She is the daughter of Manfred von Karma and <span style="color:#E16935">a student of his, who's also junior to me</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Franziska:
You're the one who's junior to me! And don't you forget it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're not conveniently avoiding the Bar Examination, are you?
</line><line>Franziska:
Hah... If you were able to pass, then I'll have absolutely no trouble at all. I'll never allow myself to lose to you! Never!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why does she always have to be this competitive...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Anyway... Papa... Are you really assigning Miles Edgeworth to cover the case?
</line><line>Manfred:
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, you know... I'm close to becoming a prosecutor myself... And I am 100% confident that I can do a better job than him!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's just like Franziska. She has no problem bad-mounting someone right in front of them.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Manfred:
...Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah...?
</line><line>Manfred:
These two will be conducting the investigation.
</line><line>Badd:
What? You want me to let both of these kids loose on the crime scene?
</line><line>Manfred:
Hah. This is a perfect opportunity for them to work on their prosecutorial skills.
</line><line>Badd:
A crime scene is not a place for children to be messing around in!
</line><line>Manfred:
I'm the one with the authority over this crime scene, Badd. ...And I will not tolerate complaining.
</line><line>Badd:
...Knngh...!
</line><line>Manfred:
Edgeworth! Franziska! I leave this case to the two of you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood, sir.
</line><line>Franziska:
Yes, Papa.
</line><line>Manfred:
I'll go take care of the paperwork now. Remember, I'll accept nothing but a perfect report from the both of you. Do not disappoint me.
</line><line>Badd:
Hold up, Von Karma.........! I still... haven't agreed to this!
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's been quite some time, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
This will be the perfect chance for us... ...to see which of us is truly worthy of the Von Karma name.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would it kill you to at least say hello?
</line><line>Franziska:
Unngh... Umm... Long time no see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very good.
</line><line>Franziska:
Just because you became a prosecutor first doesn't mean you can act all proud!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(S-She hasn't changed a bit...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! As I was saying, we shall see which one of us is worthy of the Von Karma name...
</line><line>Badd:
For cryin' out loud... I've been reduced to a babysitter...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It looks like Mr. von Karma was successful in convincing the detective. That's just like him; he never fails.)</textEffects> Now, I'd appreciate it if you could quickly run me through the facts, Detective Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
You're better off checking things out on your own.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Very well. <textEffects>(Seems like getting help from Detective Badd will be a most arduous task...)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nngh... Is the only real explanation that they killed each other simultaneously...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! You should listen to someone until they are finished talking!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Umm... What are you talking about?
</line><line>Franziska:
I'll only say it one more time... This is a competition to see who is truly worthy of the Von Karma name!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A competition...?
</line><line>Franziska:
The person that figures out the truth first wins.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... So the person who doesn't discover the truth is a dishonor to the name?
</line><line>Franziska:
Exactly! I don't care that you became a prosecutor before me... ...I simply refuse to hear any more foolish things come from your foolishly, foolish mouth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Fine, whatever makes you happy.
</line><line>Franziska:
Can I take that as you accepting my challenge?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Once again... Whatever makes you happy.
</line><line>Franziska:
Hah... Well then, let's begin the investigation, shall we? I'm going to find the perfect evidence and prettily present it like the professional I am.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Competing to discover the truth behind a crime -- how delightfully... childish.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
You kids, over there! Hold it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"Kid"!?
</line><line>Franziska:
Ha! Serves you right, Miles. He just called you a kid...!
</line><line>Badd:
...I said "<textEffects>kids</textEffects>", kid.
</line><line>Franziska:
H-How dare you call me a kid as well!?
</line><line>Badd:
I'll do what I please. And I won't allow you to cause a ruckus on my crime scene. Hey, big guy. You're... going to watch over these two.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir! Now, do what I say from now on kids, OK!?
</line><line>Franziska:
You'd better not get in our way, Scruffy! You'll feel the bite of my whip if you do!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
E-Eeek! Th-Then you, p-prosecutor boy! Let's get your investigation started already, alright!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Great. Now, even THAT detective is treating me like a child...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Alright! It's time to get investigating! Get a move on, prosecutor boy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...My name is Miles Edgeworth. And if you were to call me "prosecutor boy" one more time... ...it will be my duty as a prosecutor to "look into" your monthly salary.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? And what would you do with my salary after you saw how much it was!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's up to you now, isn't it?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Really!? Sounds good, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's so naïve...)</textEffects>
</line>

<center><textEffects>Defendant Lobby No. 2</textEffects></center>
<line>Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, may I have a word with you?
</line><line>Badd:
...What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears that both a knife and a gun were used as murder weapons.
</line><line>Badd:
...Yeah, it does.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That leads us to our first question of the investigation. Where did the men acquire the weapons?
</line><line>Badd:
...The gun was inside of Faraday's bag. It was a piece of evidence that was presented in the trial earlier today. It was used... to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. But... I never heard anything about the knife. Mr. Rell was being held by the police. There's no way he could have brought it in. Which means it's possible that Faraday had the knife on him from the start as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Could it have been a piece of evidence that had yet to be presented...? But then, why doesn't Detective Badd know about it? Wait! What if...!?)</textEffects> It's possible that Mr. Faraday brought the knife in under the guise of prosecutorial evidence. He could have then brought it out and attacked Mr. Rell with it.
</line><line>Badd:
Huh... Maybe you've got a brain in there after all, kid.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh...! <textEffects>(Is he going to treat me like a child forever!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
...It looks like Mr. Faraday attacked Mr. Rell first, who then counterattacked... That's the only logical conclusion you can draw from a scene like this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm... Not yet. I feel that it's much too early to be drawing conclusions already. I must first find conclusive evidence, so as to ensure the honor of the Von Karma name.)</textEffects>

<line><i>(Examining gun, Faraday's left hand, and knife leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Rell's cause of death was from being shot, correct? That's what we think, but it's hard to tell with him lying face down. Death is bad enough, but it's truly lamentable that someone would try to hide the truth.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Um, are you sure they were trying to hide something?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I can't confirm Mr. Rell's cause of death with his body positioned like that.)</textEffects> Detective Badd, I'd like to examine the bodies in firther detail, if possible...
</line><line>Franziska:
What's this? You're not able to form a theory with them the way they are?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe an examination of the bodies is vital to finding the perfect evidence, don't you?
</line><line>Franziska:
Hmm... I suppose you do have a point. Well!? Hurry up and get on with it!
</line><line>Badd:
...Labbie.
</line><line>Forensics:
Yes, sir! We've taken enough photos of the scene, sir.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
D-Do you not approve?
</line><line>Badd:
...Of course not.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Badd:
Investigation of a crime scene is the work of a detective. So don't touch a thing. Hey, big fella, turn over the bodies for me, will you?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
O-OK......... Please forgive me, Mr. Faraday, sir...!
</line><line>Badd:
Gumshoe... do not get emotionally involved. Remember, you're a detective!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Understood, sir!

<line><i>(Examining fountain pen and two wounds leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let us now try to understand how the two men died. First, Mr. Faraday took the gun and the knife out from today's trial evidence... ...then he aimed the gun at Mr. Rell and fired. However, Mr. Rell managed to grab the knife and counter Mr. Faraday while being shot. Then, the two men fell together where they stood. ...That is my theory, in any case.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What a crazy way to go...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Still... something about that explanation just doesn't seem right...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Gumshoe:
I guess there's not much left to investigate, huh? They really did kill each other...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... We can't conclude that quite yet. There's still something I find very peculiar here. The theory that they simply killed one another is too simplistic in this case. In fact, there is actually a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> that shows there is another possibility!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No way, pal! Really!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I suppose I will just have to show you the <textEffects>conflict in this crime scene</textEffects>.
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Edgeworth:
Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this! Mr. Faraday used his left hand to write with his fountain pen. Ergo, he is left-handed. And yet, the handgun is in his right hand! Don't you find it odd that the <textEffects>left-handed</textEffects> Mr. Faraday would hold the gun in his <textEffects>right hand</textEffects>? That. lady and gentlemen... is the great contradiction haunting this crime scene!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey, you're right, pal! That does seem kinda strange! But... How could something like that happen?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The facts add up to one conclusion, and one alone. Someone else put the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand after he died.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Someone else...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Plastic bags scattered on the floor, and a gun in the wrong hand... I sense the presence of a shadowy figure behind this case. A person of vile intent who is serious about keeping the truth from us!

<line>Badd:
Here's the autopsy report.
</line><line>Franziska:
"It is probable for that Mr. Rell survived for a short time after he was shot. However, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously from his stabbing." Interesting...
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
It looks like we now know everything we need to know about this case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you sure we know everything...?
</line><line>Franziska:
Of course! The incident began with Mr. Faraday attempting to get his revenge. The prosecutor went into a rage from being accused, and tried to kill the defendant... But, the defendant fought back and they ended up killing each other. It's all very clear and simple. There is absolutely no margin for doubt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you really believe that to be the truth?
</line><line>Franziska:
Hah! Are you saying that just because I figured out the truth before you... ...that you don't want to believe it's true?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
N-Nngh...
</line><line>Franziska:
It's alright. If you disagree with my argument, then prove me wrong. Well, if there are any contradictions to be found, that is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't worry, I will.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- What Happened --</textEffects></center>
<line>Franziska:
Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time.
From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell.
And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him.
Those are the facts of this case.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, therefore, he must've attacked first... Proving that logic to be false is probably the fastest way to show her that she's wrong. In that case, I should first look for any holes in her theory!)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(There's something strange about Franziska's theory... I should compare her claim with the data I've gathered thus far. I just know there's a contradiction somewhere!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If the two men were fighting, their struggle would've surely caused quite a bit of noise. However, Detective Gumshoe testified that he heard absolutely nothing!
</line><line>Franziska:
Hah. You place too much faith in that detective's testimony, you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say there wasn't a fight. How, then, did Mr. Rell get his hands on the knife?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's bag was sitting right here in Lobby No. 2. It is not hard to imagine that perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point!
</line><line>Franziska:
.................. So... What you're saying this: Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm......... <textEffects>(Isn't there something... strange in Franziska's statement just now?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
According to the coroner's report, Mt. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning... ..that he died immediately upon being stabbed by the knife! Ergo, he could not possibly have fired the gun after that!
</line><line>Franziska:
...Ooh, you got me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But of course.
</line><line>Franziska:
Well then, if the report is correct, then there is only one correct explanation. If we suppose that Mr. Rell attacked first... ...then Mr. Faraday, who died instantaneously, would have been unable to kill Mr. Rell.  Therefore, Mr. Rell must have stabbed Mr. Faraday after he was shot. Then they both died. That is the only explanation that make logical sense!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Negating your opponent's ideas in order to prove your own theory... I see you've been studying, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
I just wanted to explain it to you as simply as possible. before you foolishly propose a foolish theory that only a foolish fool like you could.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... How naïve of you to believe that only your opinions are valid... ...and still expect to discover the truth that the crime scene offers you... Franziska... You've still got a ways to go.
</line><line>Franziska:
What are you talking about!? Are you saying there's a flaw in my logic!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Faraday dies instantly... And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!)</textEffects> The contradiction here in this crime scene is...!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Let me get this straight. What you are arguing is this: Mr. Faraday took the <textEffects>gun</textEffects> from his evidence bag and shot Mr. Rell. Then, the wounded Mr. Rell found an opportunity to take the <textEffects>knife</textEffects> and strike back. Upon being stabbed, Mr. Faraday died on the spot, and Mr. Rell died thereafter. If that's the case, then how do you explain this? Take a good look at the order in which their bodies are piled.
</line><line>Franziska:
............N-No...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's body is lying on top of Mr. Rell's. Therefore... ...Mr. Rell must have died before Mr. Faraday!
</line><line>Franziska:
I-Impossible!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Yes, I agree that it seems strange no matter what angle you approach it from... ...which means that the real mystery behind this crime scene that we must solve is--!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:

</line><line>Franziska:
No...! Not so fast, Miles Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What now...?
</line><line>Franziska:
I simply think that you ought to think a bit more outside the box... And that it's even clearer now that the incident started with Mr. Faraday's murderous intent!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She sure bounced back quickly. An explanation won't be enought this time. It's going to take some very decisive evidence to prove her wrong!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- What Happened, Pt. 2 --</textEffects></center>
<line>Franziska:
It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's.
The two bodies fell into a pile...
...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.
It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I just know that Franziska's explanation isn't absolutely correct. All I have to do is find a hole in her logic! Once I do, I can then present her with the evidence that proves the contradiction!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
I don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.)</textEffects>

<line>Franziska:
<textEffects>The two bodies fell into a pile...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Franziska:
<textEffects>...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Franziska:
<textEffects>That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Franziska:
<textEffects>It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
So you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible. Just as it is written in the crime scene notes... ...the firing of the handgun did not leave a gunpowder burn on Mr. Rell's clothes. Therefore... Mr. Rell and the gun... ...must have been separated by a distance of at lease two or three yards!
</line><line>Franziska:
Aaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Yes... This is by far the biggest contradiction! The two bodies are piled up on each other, yet the gun was fired from a distance. And with there being no chance that Mr. Rell moved that far after being shot... ...that leaves only one possible explanation!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool! If I'm not right... ...then who was it that made the first move with the intent to kill, huh!? Who!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Here in this room... ...contradictions appear no matter which man we claim attacked first. Thus, there can be only one explanation. There was... a third person here!
</line><line>Franziska:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It was that third person who killed both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...and set their bodies up to make it look like a double murder... That third person is the real culprit!
</line><line>Franziska:
............ Miles Edgeworth... There's just one thing you're missing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Evidence, correct?
</line><line>Franziska:
Exactly. Everything you've said up until now is nothing but a story played out in your head. However, this is where the real test begins. Can you prove that there was a third person involved in this crime!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Of course. <textEffects>(If a third person was truly here, that fact would resolve the glaring contradiction. The proof that this has all been a set-up, made to look like they killed each other... I'll present it, and lay bare the final piece of the puzzle that's not yet in place! What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person.
</line><line>Franziska:
How so...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Recall Detective Gumshoe's testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
I was in the hallway the whole time, but <textEffects>I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If there wasn't a struggle in this room... ...then there shouldn't be any plastic bags on the ground. Meaning that someone else must've deliberately scattered them around!
</line><line>Franziska:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you not see the possibility in this? Disregarding the gun for the moment... ...there's a high probability of blood splatter when a knife is used on a person. If the culprit held the knife with a plastic bag around it... ...they could use the bag to catch any blood splatter from when they withdrew the knife. Then, by spreading a few more plastic bags around, mixing the bloody one in with them... ...and arranging the room to make it look like there was a struggle between the two... ...they were able to conceal their presence!
</line><line>Franziska:
Aaaaaaaaah!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
Looks like... we've still got a long way to go in this investigation...

</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What the heck's up with you, pal!?
</line><line>Yew:
Mr. Badd, I advise you to place Detective Gumshoe under arrest.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh...WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
</line><line>Badd:
......What's the meaning of this?
</line><line>Yew:
Hah! Looks like you're not man enough to discipline your own subordinates.
</line><line>Badd:
...Don't you dare...!
</line><line>Yew:
That detective claims he was there, standing in front of the door the entire time... ...but I have it on good authority that it was all a giant lie!
</line><line>Badd:
......!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ms. Yew! I ask that you please explain that last statement!
</line><line>Yew:
I'll let His Honor explain it himself.
</line><line>Judge:
I-I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you! During the recess, there was a period of time when there was no one in the hallway!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Yew:
See, Mr. Badd? So I ask you, why would a detective who was supposedly doing his job the whole time... ...want to fabricate such a lie?
</line><line>Badd:
...Gumshoe. Did you... Did you kill Faraday...!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
N-Noooooooooooooooooo! Of course not, sir!
</line><line>Franziska:
It would appear that the one who set this whole crime scene up is that detective. ...Which basically renders his testimony a complete lie and wholly invalid. It looks like your "perfect" logic has just come tumbling down, Miles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh...
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
I was in the hallway the whole time, but <textEffects>I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle</textEffects>.

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Was that statement really a lie...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
...Detective Gumshoe. You're now a suspect in the murder of two men. Now, spit out the truth, or so help me...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, I ask that you please do not act without my permission. After all, I am the one that is heading up this investigation, am I not?
</line><line>Badd:
.........Don't talk like you know what's going on, boy...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All I want is for this investigation to run perfectly.
</line><line>Franziska:
Perfection is the only wish of a disciple of Von Karma, after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Therefore, before you take Detective Gumshoe into custody... ...I'd like to set the record straight on something.
</line><line>Badd:
...And what's that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I suppose the one thing I'd liked clarified... ...is Detective Gumshoe's motive for committing this crime.
</line><line>Badd:
Hmph... Motive, huh. Gumshoe... You got a grudge against Faraday or anything...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
N-No, sir! Not me! Not a single bad thing against Mr. Faraday, sir!
</line><line>Badd:
...Is that a fact...?

</line><line>Gumshoe:
I'm telling you... I AM NOT LYING!
</line><line>Franziska:
The more unnatural you act, the more suspicious you become, you know.
</line><line>Yew:
If you want a motive, Edgeworth, I have one for you right here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could you please share it with us? However, be forewarned that I won't hesitate to object to flights of fancy... ...because all I'm interested in is the perfect explanation.
</line><line>Yew:
Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! You're serious, aren't you? ...Fine. You amuse me, so I'll humor you with a little courtroom practice.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Gumshoe's Motive --</textEffects></center>
<line>Yew:
It was... about a week ago.
I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct.
He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, "That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!"
A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge.
Well? How's that for a "perfect explanation"?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Y-You totally misunderstand me, pal! No matter how mad I get, I could never hold a grudge!
</line><line>Badd:
.........Quiet. We can't trust anything you say...!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

<textEffects>Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
I understand Detective Gumshoe's potential motive for killing Mr. Faraday... ...however, what about his motive for killing Mr. Rell?
</line><line>Yew:
His motive for killing Rell? Like I would know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... If there was no clear motive for both of the murders... ...then I doubt this incident would've occurred. Wouldn't you agree?

<center><textEffects>-- Motive To Kill The Men --</textEffects></center>
<line>Yew:
There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell.
All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men.
Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder.
Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I wonder if that's really true... Is there <span style="color:#E16935">no one</textEffects> out there with a grudge against both men?

Ms. Yew. I believe there is someone you overlooked in making your statement. Or rather... is it because you'd rather not bring this person up...?
</line><line>Yew:
.........What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We are looking for someone with a reason to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... I can think of at least one person that fits the bill! He was the suspect in the original KG-8 Incident... ...and a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Manny Coachen!
</line><line>Yew:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. The very man who came to visit you earlier out in the hallway.
</line><line>Yew:
..................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The man who killed a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Rell... ...and the man who was the lead prosecutor of the KG-8 Incident, Mr. Faraday... Are you telling me that Mr. Coachen has no reason at all to kill both of these men?
</line><line>Yew:
Well......... I suppose he might have a reason or two...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You! You covered for me, pal! ...Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't get ahead of yourself. You're still a suspect, make no mistake about that! The perfect evidence, the perfect testimony... These are the only things I wish to hold.
</line><line>Gumshoe:

</line><line>Badd:
...Coachen was up in the viewing gallery, watching the trial... or so I was told. Every cop in this place has been keeping an eye on the guy since he arrived...
</line><line>Franziska:
Then the only real suspect we have is still Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I suppose so.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No way... Come on, Detective Badd! You've gotta believe me, sir! I really was in that hallway the whole time, sir! I never took a single step into this room, sir!
</line><line>Badd:
...OK, then are you saying... there was someone else who passed through the hallway?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I-I... No... There was no one else, sir.
</line><line>Badd:
.........Then why should I believe you didn't do it...!?
</line><line>Franziska:
That is one incredibly foolish detective. Standing right in front of a crime scene all by himself... It's as good as a confession of guilt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I have to admit it's a bit strange. Most criminals will fabricate some sort of lie to escape their crimes. And if that detective really wanted to prove that he is innocent... ...you'd think he would at the very least offer up "I spaced out while on duty" or the like.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Sir... What is to become of the trial into the Cohdopian Embassy staff member's murder?
</line><line>Manfred:
Indeed. Since both the suspect and the prosecutor are now dead... ...the case will be dismissed. In other words, the trial ends here prematurely.
</line><line>Franziska:
Hah... Looks like you'll have to wait just a bit longer for your big debut.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I suppose it can't be helped.
</line><line>Manfred:
The evidence for this trial will be transferred to you in a little while.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......... Sir, what do you think about the murder of the Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...and the murders of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell?
</line><line>Manfred:
...What an outrageous circus it has all become. That Faraday brought it all upon himself wirh his naïveté.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
An outrageous circus... Right, sir.
</line><line>Manfred:
I grow weary of this topic. Edgeworth, I will have you assigned to a different case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Franziska:
Papa! You'll come and watch my courtroom debut next, won't you?
</line><line>Manfred:
Hmm... I'll consider it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Sir, if I may, please allow me to continue with my investigation.
</line><line>Manfred:
Whatever for?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I know that there is already a suspect in the murder of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...however, there is not enough evidence to prove that it was he who committed the crime. I'd like to continue investigating in order to find the perfect proof of his guilt.
</line><line>Manfred:
The perfect proof? Don't make me laugh! A worthless person like you has no right to claim such a thing as perfection!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..................
</line><line>Franziska:
.........Umm, Papa? Who do you think is the real culprit behind these murders?
</line><line>Manfred:
..................
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles and I, we're competing to see who can find the real killer first. Plus, being able to investigate a real crime scene is a really rare opportunity. It would give us some real-life experience, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Manfred:
...Hmph! If you want to investigate this case that much, then do as you wish.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then, you're allowing us to continue...?
</line><line>Manfred:
In court, your top priority is to win, and a solid investigation is one of the keys to winning. We have to make sure you become recognized as a first-rate prosecutor, don't we? .........It wouldn't be very interesting otherwise. I'm returning home now. Edgeworth, Franziska! See to it I'm not disturbed, save for the results of your competition.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, sir!
</line><line>Franziska:
Of course, Papa!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Franziska... Thank you.
</line><line>Franziska:
What are you thanking me for? Your logic earlier was built on that scruffy detective's lie. That means that the competition is still on!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, just as you wished.
</line><line>Franziska:
Hmph... I couldn't let you get off so easily. Now then, let's see how well you fare on the investigation from here, Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I know I don't have enough information yet. So my first order of business will be to question anyone involved with this case...)</textEffects>

Let's see here... Now then, how should I put this...? When you get to be my age... you need to pay more frequent visits to the restroom.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm...
</line><line>Judge:
If you go take a look through the window at the end of this hall, you'll see a small window. That is the window to the men's restroom. In other words, you can see clearly into this hallway from the men's restroom.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..................
</line><line>Judge:
When I was going into the restroom, that detective... Gumshoe, is it...? Well, he was standing in front of the vending machines buying something from it.

...Hmm...
</line><line>Judge:
However! And this I couldn't believe... When I was about to exit the restroom... ...there was not a soul in the hallway anymore!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor... If you could please calm down and explain it to me rationally...
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! I'm really sorry. Please let me regain my composure... It was really suspicious! That's what my finely-honed judge's intuition said! Although, well, until the murders occurred, I just sort of brushed it off. Ho ho ho.

We were able to discover something from the smudge on the bench. Namely, Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints.

Not happy with committing just murder, he had to go and dirty the courthouse, too!? GUILTY!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Please calm down. While it's true that the detective is the one who made the mess on the bench... ...we have not yet established that this action is related to the double murder.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe that the Detective bought a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine... ...and then, promptly sat down on the bench to eat one. The cake crumbs and pieces of chocolate on the floor under the bench... ...and Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints prove my conclusions to be true.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... But I still don't understand. Is the whole thing related to how I couldn't see him as I was leaving the restroom?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... It is indeed! The window in the hallway was built rather high up into the wall... ..at around a grown adult's chest height. As evidence, I submit that Franziska herself was unable to see out of that window.
</line><line>Franziska:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nnghooooh! <textEffects>(I knew I shouldn't have used her height as evidence!)</textEffects> ...B-Basically, what this means is that the area directly under the hallway window... ...is a <textEffects>blind spot</textEffects> when the hallway is being viewed from the men's restroom!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-Then!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... It seems that you have made the connection. If someone were to sit on the bench under the window... Yes, even someone as large as Detective Gumshoe... ...would effectively disappear from sight!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do you finally see, Your Honor? Your testimony has just proven that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway the entire time.

What!? Your Honor... I'm really sorry, but... ...I cannot allow you to not allow me to make an objection!
</line><line>Judge:
Egads! I've been overruled!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, there are simply too many holes in your testimony for my taste.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You claim that you heard the <textEffects>gunshot</textEffects> during the recess, but that is simply not possible!
</line><line>Judge:
! Mr. New Prosecutor Recommended by Manfred von...ack...!
</line><line>Franziska:
Instead of biting your tongue, why don't you bite your tongue on those preposterous names!?
</line><line>Judge:
Eek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see you have no mercy for the elderly either, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
Hmph. Don't talk back to me, unless you want to be whipped in the back.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(With your height, you'd need a step-ladder or four to accomplish that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem! Mr. Edgeworth. My ears are not that far gone yet, I'll have you know! I can still hear just fine! And I heard the sound of a gunshot loud and clear with my own two ears!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hah... Your Honor, I have here an interesting bit of testimony. It's from Detective Badd. And according to him, he heard the gunshot "right before the trial was about to start again".
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What did you just say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, you just said... ...that you heard the gunshot "about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene". How do you explain this glaring contradiction!?
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That can't beeeeeee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... that is the truth.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But! I heard it clear as day! "<textEffects>BANG!</textEffects>" The loud sound of a gunshot!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The sound of the gunshot... We keep returning to this point of contention. And that piece of evidence... I always did wonder why I found it where I did. However, now I understand what that gunshot the Judge heard really was!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Unfortunately, Your Honor, this is what really produced the gunshot you heard!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I found this object in the hallway earlier.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is that pink substance?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It may not look it, but this is actually <textEffects>a piece of a balloon</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. And I suppose you would like me to accept that pink balloon into the court record?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor... I present this piece of evidence in order to overrule your testimony!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, your argument goes as follows: You saw no one in the hallway when you heard the <textEffects>gunshot</textEffects>. Now, there is no guarantee that the detective was sitting on the bench at that time... ...therefore, you believe he must have been at the crime scene, Defendant Lobby No. 2. ...Am I correct?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that's exactly right.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Let me ask you something. Do you think that the gunshot you heard was produced by a real gun?
</line><line>Judge:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think I've said enough that even you can figure the rest out on your own. Your Honor. You were fooled by the popping of this balloon into thinking it was a gunshot!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What manner of trickery is thiiiiiiiiiiiiis!?
</line><line>Franziska:
That was a good effort you put forth, Miles Edgeworth. But if it was me, I'd have wrapped this thing up before the Judge even testified.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Care to elaborate on how one ends something before it even begins...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, to be honest... I did think that the sound was a bit off from a real gunshot sound... But who could've guessed... that someone would pop a balloon in a place like this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's true... One doesn't usually think "balloons" in conjunction with "courthouse".)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
Umm... I want to trade these coins with you!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's it...! That balloon that girl was holding... it explains everything.)</textEffects> Your Honor, if it makes you feel any better, you didn't lie once in your testimony. However, I can't really vouch for its accuracy...
</line><line>Judge:
Mmnngh... Who knew... that giving testimony could be such a difficult thing to do...? What have I done? I owe Detective Gumshoe a very, very big apology... I will see to it myself that he is released...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait... There are still a few things I have yet to resolve about what happened in the hallway. Your Honor, I request your permission to further question Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But why!? I thought we just cleared his name!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Whether we did just now or not... I still cannot say. The only think I can do for now is to continue in my quest for the perfect explanation. And to that end... ...I must resolve the remaining issues pertaining to the events that occurred in the hallway!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Please bring Detective Gumshoe into the courtroom!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I must fulfill my mission, and find the perfect explanation to this case!)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What is it now!? Is it time for my trial already!? I've already told you a gazillion times, pal! I didn't do it! 
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll be the judge of that, Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Franziska:
No, you won't! I'll be the judge of that!
</line><line>Judge:
No, no, no, no, no! I'M the judge around here! And I'LL be the judge of that!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Why can't you guys be a little less judgmental...?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well, speaking of hasty judgements, Detective Gumshoe... I'm afraid I must apologize for an error in judgement on my part.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I don't believe you should apologize just yet. We have yet to prove he is completely innocent of this crime.
</line><line>Judge:
I-I guess so...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
? Um, what are you guys talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...In any case. I would like you to testify as to your actions while you were on guard duty. And please remember, you are not on trial. This is all just a part of the investigation. As such, you may still be found to be innocent... ...however, if you should give false testimony...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeeeeoooow!
</line><line>Franziska:
My whip will object, loud and clear!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you are found to be lying, you will be held indefinitely. Understood?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
.........I gotcha, pal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Thinking back on the state of the crime scene and the Judge's testimony... ...it's obvious that Detective Gumshoe is lying. And if I can't break his lie, then we may never get a break in this case!)</textEffects>

<hr />

<line>Gumshoe:
I came down here to this courthouse on Detective Badd's orders.
As soon as I got here, he ordered me to stand guard in front of Lobby No. 2.
From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in the hallway the whole time!
On my honor as a detective, I swear it wasn't me, pal!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Franziska:
He's still singing the same tired tune.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Franziska:
To have such a foolishly foolish contradiction... ... in such a foolishly foolish testimony is just plain old foolish.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Indeed. However, in the pursuit of the perfect investigation, I'm afraid we have to deal with it. By Squashing it under the weight of the evidence!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I have... an objection.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh--!? Wh-Wh-Wh-What is it, pal!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe... I wonder if you might recognize this from somewhere?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! It's one of those things! The Courthouse Special Swiss Rolls, right pal!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Precisely. In that case, I suppose... ...that you also recall the sullied hallway bench?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! You know what!? I think it was probably me that did that!
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Gumshoe! You know you can't go around dirtying up the courthouse like this!
</line><line>Franziska:
You inconsiderate, slovenly pig!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eeeek! I promise to clean it up later! I swear!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, shall we get down to business? About the fact that you didn't move even a single step from in front of that door... If that really were the case, then how were you able to buy a pack of Swiss rolls!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aaaaaack!
</line><line>Franziska:
Furthermore, if you didn't move a single step from in front of that door... ...how did you manage to get the bench dirty with your grubby hands!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeeeeeeeeeeeowwwwwwwwch!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It appears that Franziska's whip can do more damage than my words alone can...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
A-Alright... I confess, pal. I was hungry, so I bought a pack for myself, OK!? I thought I'd get chewed out again if anyone found out about me eating on the job... ...so I didn't want to say anything!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, unfortunately for you, I saw you do the whole dastardly deed! I clearly saw you buying a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
*sigh* OK, OK, I'm sorry for lying! But that's all I'm sorry for, you got that! Because I'm not holding anything else back!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That last statement... It may sound like it makes sense... ...however, there is something I don't quite believe about it!)</textEffects> ...Are you sure you're not withholding further information from us?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? O-O-O-O-Of course not! I've got nothing else to hide, pal!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Oh, if only that were true, Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-B-B-B-B-But it IS true, pal! I swear there's nothing else!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, I'm sure you are aware of the price of a pack of Swiss rolls, correct?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh!? Umm... Remind me again, pal!?
</line><line>Franziska:
That vending machine out in the hallway... ...is selling packs of two Swiss rolls for $6 a pack.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mmmmnnnnrrrrgh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And yet, according to you... ...you didn't have any cash on you until you cashed your $5 annual bonus check. Isn't that right?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oooooooooonnngh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let me ask then, how did you managed to purchase a pack all by yourself? Can you provide me with a proper explanation to that?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aaaaaaaargh! I told you, I bought it by myself, pal! There wasn't anyone else in that hallway with me... ...so there's no one who could've helped me buy it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wait, don't tell me... You've got some kind of proof that there was someone else in the hallway, don't you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Correct.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
As if you could! I mean, what are the chances of that... Wait, you do...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course I do.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Hooooooooooow!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What proof do I have that there must have been someone else there in the hallway...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gumshoe:
Hey! You showed that to me not two seconds ago, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah... I think you're under the mistaken impression that I bought this pack of rolls.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wait, if you didn't buy it... then that means you must've stolen it! You thief!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh--!? I would never do such a thing!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
All you liars are the same; you start out as thieves! You're under arrest, pal!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe you meant to assert that all thieves start out as liars. And in that case, what does that say about you, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Gnnrk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This particular Swiss roll was dropped by a certain someone.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
.........Oh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There were two rolls in this package. You ate one of them... ...but you then gave the other one to a certain other person, didn't you?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No way, pal! You've got it all wrong! I ate both of them...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It would appear that we've caught you at last.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! Don't you dare do anything bad to that girl!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It would appear that they DO know each other after all...)</textEffects> So, why do you continue to come up to me and kick me? Have I wronged you somehow?
</line><line>???:
I have a name, and it's Kay!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay what...?
</line><line>Kay:
Kay Faraday!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Faraday... Are you perhaps, Mr. Faraday's daughter?
</line><line>Kay:
I'm not a "you"! I'm "Kay"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mnnrgh... Kay. You know... good little girls don't kick other people. Especially not hard enough to leave big, nasty bruises like the way you do...
</line><line>Kay:
Well, then you shouldn't have put Gummy under arrest, mister!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
G-Gummy...?
</line><line>Judge:
My guess is that she's talking about Detective Gumshoe.
</line><line>Franziska:
...What a cute nickname you've given him.
</line><line>Kay:
Gummy didn't do anything wrong!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Kay...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It appears that I will need to speak with her in a bit more detail...
</line><line>Kay:
Rwaaaar!

I, myself, was also involved in a case at this courthouse when I was a young child... A case in which my father, who was a defense attorney, passed away. All of my dreams of becoming a lawyer were crushed into fine ash on that nightmarish day. Even now, the wound festers deep in the depths of my soul. Even since that incident... I've dedicated myself to locking away every criminal I can. And now, to have this happen right in front of me...

</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! There is still something you have yet to resolve.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I beg your pardon?
</line><line>Franziska:
You still haven't offered an explanation for why that man would lie to us.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-That's...! Well...
</line><line>Kay:
! Gummy... Don't tell me you lied for my sake...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! don't worry about it, Kay! Everything's gonna be OK!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ah, so that's why...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
So, what was Detective Gumshoe's motive for lying? If you can't explain that, then you can't call this a perfect investigation!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. His reason for lying is very simple.
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Here is what I believe to be his reason: From simple observation of the Detective's actions and his interactions with Kay... ...it's obvious the Detective was lying for the young girl's sake. And this piece of evidence will show you exactly why. <textEffects>(Which piece of evidence proves that Detective Gumshoe was lying on account of Kay?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Franziska:
Mr. Faraday and Kay's Promise Notebook? How does this explain anything?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you could take a look at this page, it's clearly written that Kay should... "Never take things from a stranger." When Detective Gumshoe heard about that promise, he tried to cover for Kay.
</line><line>Franziska:
......... What a foolishly foolish fool's fool of a foolish reason for a fool!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eeeowwwwww!
</line><line>Kay:
Gummy... You lied because of me, didn't you?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Because I'm your friend, Kay! That's why!
</line><line>Kay:
Gummy...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...At long last. Detective Gumshoe, can you please tell me the whole truth now?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Guess there's no beating you, huh, pal? OK, OK, I'll spill the goods! I'd been standing guard for a while... I was getting really hungry, and that snack vending machine was taunting me.
</line><line>Franziska:
But all the cash you had on you was $5, and that wasn't enough to buy anything, right? After all, the cheapest item in that machine is a $6 pack of Swiss rolls.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah... But then, like an angel from heaven, Kay showed up...
</line><line>Kay:
I was thinking about sharing a snack with Daddy... ...so I wanted to buy a Swiss roll. But I only had about a dollar in coins.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
So we pooled my $5 and her $1 together... ...and bought a pack of Swiss rolls together.
</line><line>Kay:
But I was worried... ...about breaking one of my promises. So then Gummy said...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Faraday's one scary guy when he gets mad! But, don't worry. You won't get in trouble if I don't tell, right!? Besides, you bought it with me! So you didn't really get it from me, you know?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
...He told me it'd be OK... And he gave me a whole roll to save and give to Daddy.
</line><line>Franziska:
...Who knew that Scruffy could be so considerate...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed... Detective, I take it that you then sat down on the bench and ate the rolls together?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, we split the other roll and ate it right then! The sweet taste of that cake's chocolate... I'll never forget it as long as I live, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Anyway... Kay, I believe this also belongs to you.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! That's from the balloon I popped...
</line><line>Franziska:
It's bad manners to leave garbage lying around, Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
I'm sorry...
</line><line>Franziska:
Well, I guess I can't blame you for not throwing this one piece away. It was sitting high up on a windowsill where you couldn't see it. So just this once, I forgive you.
</line><line>Kay:
But that balloon... I wanted to surprise Gummy a little, so I popped it on purpose... ...and because of me, Gummy dropped his half of the Swiss roll.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aha ha ha! Wow, you really got me there, pal!
</line><line>Kay:
So I thought maybe I should give Gummy this other roll. And then, I saw you picking on Gummy, mister...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you kicked me, is that it?
</line><line>Franziska:
You sure are a feisty one.
</line><line>Kay:
I'm really sorry, mister...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's alright. I'm perfectly unharmed. But about this Swiss roll... Would it be alright with you... ...If I held onto it until Detective Gumshoe is cleared of all charges and free to go?
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah! Sure! Just make sure you give it to Gummy afterwards, OK!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course. I promise. Now then, I believe we have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt... ...that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway for the entire duration of his duty. Which undeniably proves... ...that Detective Gumshoe could not have committed the double murders.

</line><line>Yew:
Actually, it proves just the opposite, Edgeworth. You've just shown... ...that Detective Gumshoe is the only one who could have committed the crime.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What do you mean!?
</line><line>Franziska:
It's quite rude to eavesdrop, Ms. Yew.
</line><line>Yew:
Phwwh... Ahah... Ahahahahaha! Mnnphwwwwh... I'm getting lectured on manners... ...by a girl with a penchant for whipping people! Phwwwwkkkgh!
</line><line>Franziska:
Wh-What!? How dare you talk back with such insolence!?
</line><line>Kay:
You're wrong, lady! Gummy's not the bad guy!
</line><line>Yew:
Oh, and what have we here? What is a child doing here in a courthouse? Bailiff! Please take this child in!
</line><line>Kay:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Ms. Calisto Yew! That girl is Mr. Faraday's...!
</line><line>Yew:
I know. So what? You think that just because she's the victim's daughter... ...she gets to just run wild all around the crime scene? I think it's actually quite dangerous for her, to speak nothing of getting underfoot.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose you're right, however...
</line><line>Yew:
As long as we're in agreement on that point, let's get back to the real issue at hand. Now then, Detective, you were in front of the door to Lobby No. 2 the entire time, correct?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but...
</line><line>Yew:
You see! Isn't it obvious that it could only be the detective? He is the only person who could've gone into Lobby No. 2 at the time of the murders!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Arngh! <textEffects>(I... have no counterargument to that...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Yew:
Don't worry, I've already put in the necessary paperwork for his formal arrest.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nnrgh! But the investigation is far from over!
</line><line>Yew:
Oh, that's right. I was going to speak with you about that. Don't you think it's reckless to talk to the suspect out in the open without a guard?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngh... I suppose it is...
</line><line>Yew:
Well, as someone with more experience in law than you, allow me to share something: Always keep a good eye on a criminal, or you may regret what comes of your negligence.
</line><line>Franziska:
Oooooh...! Miles, I can't believe you're letting this woman lecture you like this! This is unforgivable as a disciple of Von Karma!
</line><line>Yew:
Ha ha ha. Down, tigress. Now then, I'll be looking forward to the results of your investigation.
</line><line>Franziska:
So. We're back to square one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, this is our last chance. I can tell that if we fail to solve this case... ...Detective Gumshoe will be formally charged under all of the circumstantial evidence. <textEffects>(This investigation is not over yet. There's still one location we have yet to inspect. It's where Detective Badd and Ms. Yew were at the time of the crime -- Lobby No. 1!)</textEffects>
