Athena:
Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least.
</line><line>Apollo:
"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation.
</line><line>Trucy:
Back! ...Eek!
</line><line>Athena:
Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work?
</line><line>Trucy:
Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick!
</line><line>Apollo:
I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape.
</line><line>Athena:
And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct.
</line><line>Athena:
The real fight starts right now!
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah!
</line><line><textEffects>Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I wonder where all that stuff goes?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!

<line>
Athena:
Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so...
</line><line>Athena:
Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover.
</line><line>Athena:
I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need!
</line><line>Apollo:
The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created!
</line><line>Athena:
If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up.
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.)</textEffects> Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it.
</line><line>Athena:
Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, dust... Lots of dust.
</line><line>Athena:
So, what'd you find?
</line><line>Apollo:
You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail?
</line><line>Athena:
I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer.
</line><line>Athena:
B-B-But...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(If we don't turn things around quickly...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
In justice we trust!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed!
</line><line>Apollo:
Argh!
</line><line>Athena:
Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on!
</line><line>Apollo:
Let me suffer in peace.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more!
</line><line>Athena:
It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?!
</line><line>Athena:
Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?!
</line><line>Athena:
We did it, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but how long can we keep this up?

<line>Apollo:
Are there any other new developments we should know?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something.
</line><line>Apollo:
He did? What did he say?
</line><line>Fulbright:
He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: "I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!" ...and other things of that nature.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha.
</line><line>Athena:
What now, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
How about regrouping back at the agency?
</line><line>Athena:
Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there.

</line><line>Athena:
And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms...
</line><line>Trucy:
Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out.
</line><line>Apollo:
How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down.
</line><line>Trucy:
In other words, business as usual, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too.

Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up...

Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough...

Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too.

Mr. Wright.

How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena?

I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before.

Really? What happened?

<line>Athena:
All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Keep believing in my client. Right!)</textEffects> Um, Mr. Wright?

Yes?

Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something!

Caw-shaaaaaaaaw!
</line><line>Athena:
Eeek!
</line><line>Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned!
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai!
</line><line>Apollo:
I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again.
</line><line>Tenma:
Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste!
</line><line>Athena:
Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom.
</line><line>Apollo:
Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean?
</line><line>Tenma:
If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will!
</line><line>Apollo:
I suppose it's worth a shot.

<textEffects>(I should question him about the blackmail letter,  too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Tenma:
Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian.
</line><line>Apollo:
Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
</line><line>Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal!

<line>Athena:
Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber?
</line><line>Apollo:
We should probably search it for clues.
</line><line>Athena:
Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole?

Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help.

Hey, isn't that...?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Grrr. You dare imprison me?
</line><line>Athena:
Jinxie! She's... acting really strange.
</line><line>Jinxie:
That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you!
</line><line>Apollo:
J-Jinxie, are you all right?
</line><line>Jinxie:
! Eeeeeek!
</line><line>Apollo:
Aaaah!
</line><line>Jinxie:
Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Morning, Jinxie.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi!
</line><line>Apollo:
Makura... gaeshi?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep!
</line><line>Apollo:
...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag.
</line><line>Athena:
Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead?
</line><line>Jinxie:
I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Jinxie:
I'd better reapply them.
</line><line>Apollo:
Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else!

Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here?
</line><line>Fulbright:
I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Question me? ...Sorry, not interested.
</line><line>Apollo:
Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair?
</line><line>Fulbright:
That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right?
</line><line>Fulbright:
No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust!
</line><line>Apollo:
The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash.
</line><line>Jinxie:
So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you!
</line><line>Athena:
He took her away.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.)</textEffects>

Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman.

Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.)</textEffects>

Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME?

Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... <textEffects>(Where's that ringing coming from?)</textEffects>
</line><line>L'Belle:
You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here.
</line><line>Apollo:
What the--?! <textEffects>(Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>L'Belle:
...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare.
</line><line>Athena:
......Where do you buy clothes like that?
</line><line>L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in <textEffects>functional beauty</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack!
</line><line>L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for <textEffects>beauty</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:

Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met.

.........
</line><line>Apollo:
Umm.........
</line><line>Tenma:
.........Why are you speaking like that?
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...!
</line><line>Tenma:
Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me.
</line><line>Apollo:
That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time.
</line><line>Tenma:
So, what can I do for you today?
</line><line>Apollo:
We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed.
</line><line>Tenma:
Ah!
</line><line>Apollo:
She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial.
</line><line>Tenma:
.................. Heh heh heh...
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me!
</line><line>Apollo:
Aagh! Th-The charm!
</line><line>Athena:
Tenma Taro's back!
</line><line>Tenma:
Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings!
</line><line>Apollo:
Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. <textEffects>(And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.)</textEffects>

<line>Guard:
You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence!
</line><line>Tenma:
Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there.
</line><line>Guard:
The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it.
</line><line>Tenma:
Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw!
</line><line>Guard:
Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?)</textEffects> Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore!
</line><line>Athena:
But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him?

L'Belle:
Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top!
</line><line>Filch:
Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh!
</line><line>L'Belle:
You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What on Earth are they practicing?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Filch:
Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy!
</line><line>L'Belle:
Ouuuw!
</line><line>Filch:
Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes!
</line><line>L'Belle:
Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours?
</line><line>Apollo:
......... <textEffects>(Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo?
</line><line>L'Belle:
Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.)</textEffects>

<line>L'Belle:
FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones!
</line><line>Filch:
Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did.
</line><line>L'Belle:
Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow.
</line><line>Filch:
Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! RIght up the schnozzola!
</line><line>L'Belle:
Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say!
</line><line>Filch:
Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon!
</line><line>Athena:
There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! <textEffects>(All that's left now is that <span style="color:#E16935">lie</textEffects> Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.)</span>
</line><line>Athena:
You think they're done questioning Jinxie?
</line><line>Apollo:
Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms.

Jinxie:
Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr...
</line><line>Athena:
She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.)</textEffects> Pssst... Jinxie?
</line><line>Jinxie:
......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Are they done questioning you, Jinxie?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, which one?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together!
</line><line>Apollo:
Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together?
</line><line>Jinxie:
Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue.
</line><line>Jinxie:
No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning.
</line><line>Apollo:
We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack!
</line><line>Jinxie:
No fighting.
</line><line>Apollo:
*sigh* Charm-slapped again.
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
You were very nervous when you said, "That's all he said," weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm.
</line><line>Jinxie:
Huh?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you?
</line><line>Jinxie:
I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep...
</line><line>Apollo:
Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else!
</line><line>Jinxie:
E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers!

<line>Athena:
Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I know, I know...)</textEffects> Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third part in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber.
</line><line>Athena:
But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well.
</line><line>Apollo:
Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation.
</line><line>Athena:
Our mystery person must've fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro!
</line><line>Jinxie:
B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Whatever it takes in court tomorrow, Apollo... ...we have to take down that dirty, rotten "Tenma Taro" Florent L'Belle!
</line><line>Apollo:
Right. We'll get him with a legal exorcism, Justice style!
