<line>
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You may call your first witness.<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;; changed to &#39;&#39;If we may call our first witness, Your Honor&#39;&#39; in the iOS and 3DS remakes">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic]; changed to <i>If we may call our first witness, Your Honor</i> in the iOS and 3DS remakes)</textEffects> The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They're still calling it a "statue"...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Floor plans added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."
</line>

<center><textEffects>-- Maya Fey's Arrest --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. <textEffects>(Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>...whoosh...SMACK!</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Something the matter?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.

<line>Gumshoe:

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I heard you say it!
</line><line>Judge:
You did say it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You said it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Umm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gah!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Hard Evidence --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.
</line><line>Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.

<textEffects>(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-backwards?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?
</line>



<line>Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no way!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.
</line><line>Judge:
I see!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.
</line><line>Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.
</line><line>Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Darn! This isn't good!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!
</line><line>Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.
</line><line>April:
April May! At your service! *wink*
</line><line>Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton <textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;; changed to &#39;&#39;wanton&#39;&#39; in the 3DS remake">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic]; changed to <i>wanton</i> in the 3DS remake)</textEffects> winking!
</line><line>April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?
</line><line>April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices?
</line><line>April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.
</line><line>Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.

<center><textEffects>-- Witness's Account --</textEffects></center>
<line>April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?
</line><line>Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
</line><line>April:
W-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...
</line>


<line>April:
Urp!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?
</line><line>April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!
</line><line>April:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!
</line><line>April:
But... but!
</line><line>Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...
</line><line>Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?
</line><line>April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.
</line><line>Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.
</line><line>April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*
</line><line>Judge:

The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
</line><line>April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!
</line><line>April:
Urp!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
</line><line>April:
Oooh... urp!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! <textEffects>(Well, only once...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)</textEffects>
</line><line>April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
</line><line>April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey &amp; Co.!
</line><line>April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey &amp; Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! <textEffects>(I can't give up now!)</textEffects> I'm not satisfied because...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!
</line>



<line>Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!
</line><line>April:
F-fat!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.
</line><line>Phoenix:
?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!
</line><line>Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have proof.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Take a look at this!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.
</line><line>April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.)</textEffects> Let's hear the conversation.

</line><line>Mia:
<textEffects>[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
<textEffects>[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]</textEffects>

Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!
</line><line>April:
Muh... muh... muh!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?
</line><line>April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*
</line><line>Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!
</line><line>Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.

<line>Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!
</line><line>April:
W-whaaat!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!
</line><line>April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?
</line><line>April:
Mmpf...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?
</line><line>April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!
</line><line>Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!
</line><line>April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(S-scary...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?
</line><line>April:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay, this is it!)</textEffects> Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...

<line>Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
</line><line>April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?

Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.

I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!
</line><line>Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!
</line><line>Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.
</line><line>Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?
</line><line>Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Nice try!)</textEffects> That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!
</line><line>Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...
</line><line>Phoenix:
!
</line><line>Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!

<line>Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!

<line>Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?
</line><line>Bellboy:
Yes, sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?
</line><line>Bellboy:
That's right, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who! Who is this "other person"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Simple, it was...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!
</line><line>Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.

That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!

Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.
</line><line>Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh... I see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!
</line><line>Maya:
A "lead"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.
</line><line>Maya:
Yes sir!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.
</line><line>Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe so.
</line><line>Maya:
Sis...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.
</line><line>Maya:
I'm counting on you!

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.
</line><line><textEffects>May Testimony added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!
