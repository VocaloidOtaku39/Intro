</line><line>Trucy:
Well, I'd better get going!
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Where to?
</line><line>Trucy:
To practice my act, of course! The show's only a few days away!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're really pushing yourself. Didn't you practice until late last night, too?
</line><line>Trucy:
Yup! Because everything's gotta be just right!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Trucy inherited all of Troupe Gramarye's magic tricks from her father when he died. And the troupe's entire legacy is now resting on her shoulders. No wonder she's feeling the pressure.)</textEffects> It looks like everything's going well today, though. I mean, that last trick was perfect!
</line><line>Trucy:
Grace under pressure -- that's me! After all, "<textEffects>a true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face</textEffects>!" That's the Troupe Gramarye creed!
</line><line>Apollo:
It's hard to believe you've accomplished so much, even though you're still in high school.
</line><line>Trucy:
Hee hee. But, to tell you the truth, I'm actually pretty nervous.
</line><line>Apollo:
Who wouldn't be? <textEffects>(Oh, I bet this would do the trick...)</textEffects> You'll be FINE, Trucy! If anybody can do it, you can!
</line><line>Trucy:
P-Polly... That was just the boost I needed! Thanks!
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo's "fine" sure has a way of really hitting you right in the heart -- and in the ears.
</line><line>Apollo:
Enough ragging on my voice already...
</line><line>???:
Trucy?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, hi, Bonny!
</line><line>Bonny:
It's almost time for the second act.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, okay. Thanks! Well, Apollo, Athena -- enjoy the rest of the show!
</line><line>Apollo:
Break a leg, Trucy!
</line><line>Trucy:
Thanks. I will!
</line><line>Athena:
I hope her new trick goes well.
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, this is Trucy we're talking about. She'll be fine.
</line><line>???:
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure...
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Bonny:
Performing magic is like walking a tightrope -- there's always an element of danger. One little mistake can even cost you your life, you know. I wonder if she'll make it across today...
</line><line>Apollo:
Umm... and what do you mean by that, exactly?
</line><line>Bonny:
Hee hee. Oh, nothing! Now, if you'll excuse me...
</line><line>Apollo:
She's gone... <textEffects>(What was that all about? Judging by what she said, I'm going to guess she's probably a magician, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Come on, Apollo! We've gotta get back to our seats now or we'll be late!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ow! Hey, stop pulling! Okay, let's see... <textEffects>(Guess it's time to <span style="color:#E16935">Move</textEffects> back to the stage...)</span>

Hurry up, Apollo! It's about to start! I want to see what Trucy's next trick is!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're really wound up today, aren't you... Why don't you take your seat and try to relax?
</line><line>Athena:
Whoa! Look! There's a TV reporter over there! With a TV camera and everything!
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>Oh, yeah, baby!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Athena, sit down! You're blocking people's view! Yeesh, I feel like I'm babysitting here...
</line><line>Reporter:
Hello, everyone! I'm reporting from the beautiful Penrose Theater... ...where the public performance of "Trucy in Gramarye-Land" begins in just two short days! But today, they've very kindly agreed to give us a sneak preview! Isn't this exciting!
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo! Do you think I was on TV just now?!
</line><line>Apollo:
How should I know? But if you were, you were disgracing our entire agency, that's for sure.
</line><line>Athena:
H-Hey! What the heck's that supposed to mean?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Ooh! Here it comes!

Trucy:
Now, give up your dastardly ways! Huh?
</line><line>Bonny:
Over here!
</line><line>Trucy:
Ahhh!
</line><line>Bonny:
Come now, Mr. Hat! Offer the girl's life up to Mr. Reus and bring him back to life! Wh-What?!
</line><line>Athena:
- Whaaahaha!
</line><line>Apollo:
- Wow! Just when and how did she make the switch?!
</line><line>Trucy:
You won't be reviving anyone today!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Wow, that was amazing! I have no idea how she escaped that coffin!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I'm glad Trucy's escape trick went off without a hitch.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
And when I open the coffin, like this... inside you seeeee... ...M-Mr. Reus? But how...?
</line><line>Athena:
I wonder what's going on.
</line><line>Apollo:
He's... not getting up...
</line><line>Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>Apollo:
Trucy?! Wh-What just happened?!
</line><line>Whoa man! An accident?!
</line><line>Is, like, that guy DEAD?!
</line><line>Athena:
...Wait. That's not part of the act?
</line><line>Staff:
Attention, please! For your own safety, we ask that everyone please evacuate the building.
</line><line>Apollo:
What's going on? Is Trucy okay?!
</line><line>Staff:
Outside, everyone! Evacuate immediately, please!
</line><line>Apollo:
Whoa! Hey! Stop grabbing at me!

Trucyyyyyyy!

</line><line>Hey, what gives?!
</line><line>Will somebody please tell us what's going on?!
</line><line>Athena:
Poor Trucy! I hope she's okay... ...Hey, here comes that staff member from before.
</line><line>Staff:
Your attention, please! We regret to inform you that today's show has been canceled!
</line><line>What?!
</line><line>But I was looking forward to the rest of it!
</line><line>Staff:
W-We are very sorry, but the theater is on lock-down pending a police investigation.
</line><line>Apollo:
E-Excuse me! Is it because of that accident? That man in the coffin -- is he...?
</line><line>Staff:
U-Um, well... We're still trying to figure things out, sir... But I can tell you that Ms. Wright is fine. She wasn't injured, so please don't worry.
</line><line>Apollo:
Thank goodness she's okay...
</line><line>???:
Hey, you there! What the heck's going on?! They wouldn't even let ME in. ME, for crying out loud!
</line><line>Staff:
Oh, Mr. Retinz! There was an accident during the show.
</line><line>Retinz:
An accident? Great, just great. That's all I need right now. Do you have any idea how much money we're sinking into this program?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... and you are...?
</line><line>Retinz:
The man behind the scenes, that's who. This is a fine kettle of fish, let me tell ya! Spinning all this is gonna be a real pain in my posterior, believe you me!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Spinning? As in covering it up?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Retinz:
Look, I gotta get inside. Seriously, can't a guy catch a break around here?!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, there he goes...
</line><line>Athena:
Why don't we go back to the office for now? I'm sure Trucy will call us once things have settled down.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, I guess you're right.

<line>Apollo:
It's no use. I can't get a hold of Mr. Wright. I wonder if something happened to him in Khura'in.
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe he got caught up in some kind of trouble again, as always.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, trouble's drawn to him like iron filings to a magnet.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, Apollo! Speaking of Khura'in, they're showing something about it on TV right now!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>There has been some surprising news coming out of the Kingdom of Khura'in. The country recently saw defense attorney Phoenix Wright win a "not guilty" verdict... ...the first verdict of its kind in twenty-three years!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...! Mr. Wright won a trial in Khura'in?!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>Lawyers are said to be highly disrespected in the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...so Mr. Wright's win was an upset victory amidst entrenched hostility.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Wow! Did you hear that?! The first time in twenty-three years!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah... But what was he doing in court there in the first place? I thought he just went for a visit.
</line><line>Athena:
So he WAS in some kind of trouble, just like we thought!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>Next, an update on the unfortunate accident that occurred at the Penrose Theater...</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, now they're talking about the accident at Trucy's show!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>Famed magician "The Great Mr. Reus" was skewered with a sword and died on the spot.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, no! So... he really is dead...
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>And now, here is the footage of that deadly moment.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>TV:
<textEffects>Mr. Reus's body isn't visible in this footage... ...but these are still very shocking images. The magician, Trucy Wright, is reportedly still only a high school student. Could it be that this unfortunate accident happened due to a lack of proper training? Did the young magician have enough experience, preparation, and knowledge? Some might say that Troupe Gramarye should be held accountable for this incident.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey! What kind of biased reporting is this?
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah! They're making it sound like it's all Trucy's fault!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>Oh! We've just received more breaking news. ......Oh, my! The young magician in question, Trucy Wright... ...is now under arrest on the charge of involuntary manslaughter!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-Whaaaat?!
</line><line>TV:
<textEffects>We will keep you updated as this unfortunate tale unfolds. Stay tuned!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Trucy's under arrest?! She can't be!
</line><line>Athena:
...Apollo! We've gotta do something!
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah. Let's get down to the detention center right away! <textEffects>(But before I forget, I think I'll jot a few things down about the case. I'll just open up the Court Record... ...and make a few <span style="color:#E16935">Notes</textEffects>. I can use it like a kind of "To Do" list. If I ever get stuck, I can just refer to these notes.)</span>

</line><line>Trucy:
...Oh! Polly! Athena!
</line><line>Athena:
Trucy... Are you okay?
</line><line>Trucy:
...I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
</line><line>Apollo:
We saw the news about the accident on TV.
</line><line>Trucy:
Eh heh heh. Guess I can't Houdini my way out of this one. I got arrested and everything! They say I'm the one who caused the accident.
</line><line>Apollo:
But that's not true... right?
</line><line>Trucy:
To be honest... I don't really know. I mean, I have no idea how an accident like that could've happened. The trick went off without a hitch. I'm sure of that much! Still, the police just won't listen to me! They've already decided that it was all my fault! *sigh* I'm exhausted after all their questions...
</line><line>Athena:
Looks like she's been able to hang in there at least.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah... <textEffects>(She really is one tough cookie.)</textEffects> I know you're tired, but... ...can you tell us a little bit about the accident?
</line><line>Trucy:
Yes, of course! Go ahead and ask me anything! I'll be... I'll be fine!

<line>Apollo:
Come on, Trucy. You should know by now that you can't hide anything from me.
</line><line>Trucy:
! Don't tell me that your bracelet reacted...
</line><line>Apollo:
Yup.
</line><line>Trucy:
And here I thought my smile was going to do the trick... Heh. Looks like I broke the first rule of being a magician. "<textEffects>A true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face</textEffects>," right?
</line><line>Apollo:
I remember hearing you say that before.
</line><line>Trucy:
That's right. It's a Gramarye motto that my daddy used to say before he passed away. I'll never forget it. It's one of the few precious memories I have of him.
</line><line>Apollo:
But you can't keep everything inside, Trucy. You'll burst! Why don't you tell me what's bothering you?
</line><line>Trucy:
I can't! If I did... ...you wouldn't believe in me anymore!
</line><line>Apollo:
That's not true. As an entertainer, you believe in always keeping a smile on your face. <textEffects>And as a lawyer, I have a belief that's important to me as well.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Trucy:
! Your attorney's badge...?
</line><line>Apollo:
I swore on this badge that I would <textEffects>always believe in my client to the bitter end</textEffects>. That's the cornerstone of being a good lawyer. Mr. Wright taught me as much. So no matter what you tell me, I'm going to keep on believing in you, Trucy! All I ask is for you to have a little faith in me,
too.
</line><line>Trucy:
............ All right. Thanks, Polly.

<textEffects>(Yeesh... Talk about an emotional roller coaster...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
We'll need to investigate the stage at the Penrose Theater where the body was found.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah... I hope no one will try to stop us.
</line><line>Trucy:
If you're going to the Penrose Theater, can I ask you a favor?
</line><line>Apollo:
Of course. What is it?
</line><line>Trucy:
I left a very special notebook behind in my dressing room...
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure. We can pick it up for you.
</line><line>Trucy:
That notebook is really, REALLY important to me! I-I don't know WHAT I'd do if anybody read&amp; it...! Nngh...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(W-Wow. I wonder what's in it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
The notebook is in my <textEffects>blue handbag</textEffects> on the table. lt's <textEffects>big and black</textEffects> -- you can't miss it. Thanks in advance! And with that, I've gotta go. It seems they've got more questions for me.

Hey, this is the place -- the theater where that "magical murder" happened!

Oh, yeah. Wonder if they brought the dead body out yet.

Yeah, a high school student. Can you believe it? Kids these days.

What? Was it something I said?

You're darn right it's something you said! What's with you brushing me off like that? We've got heaps to catch up on! After all we've been through... You're not still mad at me about something, are you?

S-Sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...

Who's this, Apollo? A distant cousin or something?
</line><line>Apollo:
N-No, Ema's a detective I've had the, uh... pleasure of working with before.
</line><line>Ema:
Hello. I'm <textEffects>Ema Skye</textEffects>, <textEffects>forensic investigator</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
What? So you're finally a full-fledged forensic investigator?
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah! I finally achieved my life-long dream! Look! I even have an official forensic investigator armband and everything!
</line><line>Apollo:
That's great, Ema! I bet the exam was really hard, huh.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, it was a cinch!
</line><line>Apollo:
Really? 'Cause I thought you said something about failing it over and over...
</line><line>Ema:
Well, never mind that! The important thing is, I'm not a plain ol' detective anymore! So no more boring ol' investigations for me! I'm so happy, I could hug the whole world!
</line><line>Apollo:
Coming from you, that's really something.
</line><line>Ema:
Criminals beware! Fingerprinting, luminol testing, DNA analysis -- Ema Skye is raring to go, o bring it on!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wow. I guess it's "goodbye, grumpy clouds -- hello, fanatical sun.")</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
She's very cheerful, isn't she? Is it because of the weather or something?
</line><line>Apollo:
She sure wasn't like this before. She was pretty frustrated back when she was assigned to the Criminal Affairs Department. And she was always munching on chocolate Snackoos to relieve her stress.
</line><line>Ema:
Snackoos and stress are a thing of the past. I've said goodbye to both of them.
</line><line>Apollo:
And may you never have to see either again.
</line><line>Ema:
By the way, are you two here because of the murder?
</line><line>Apollo:
"<textEffects>Murder</textEffects>"? Don't you mean the "accident"?
</line><line>Ema:
Oh. Then I guess you haven't heard. The case is being treated as a straight-up <textEffects>homicide</textEffects> now.
</line><line>Apollo:
What?
</line><line>Ema:
Just so you know, I heard that the prosecution is going to argue tomorrow that... ...<textEffects>Trucy outright murdered Mr. Reus</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Athena:
Are you kidding?! They're treating it as a murder?!

Of course! Anything to help Trucy!

This is looking pretty bad, Apollo... They're calling it a murder, and they've even got proof! What are we gonna do?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Look on the bright side, that's what.
</line><line>Athena:
Bright side? What bright side?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, the good thing about there being proof is that it has to point to the real killer. If we can find out who that is... ...we can prove Trucy's innocence!
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! H-Hey, you're right...
</line><line>Apollo:
Which means our objectives are clear. We have to find two things: proof of Trucy's innocence... ...and evidence of the true culprit's identity.

"Mischief"? Sounds like Ema trusts you about as far as she can throw you, Apollo.
</line><line>Ema:
He HAS been known to move things around at the scene of a crime, you know.

And what about you? You used to do all kinds of forensic tests on things without permission.

There's nothing wrong with that! After all, forensics is ALWAYS on the side of justice!

</line><line>Apollo:
...Athena! I think I've got it! I think somebody <textEffects>switched</textEffects> Trucy's rubber sword for the metal one.
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?
</line><line>Apollo:
To pin the murder on her.
</line><line>Athena:
Someone switched the swords? But when could they have done that?
</line><line>Apollo:
When everyone was too busy to notice. <textEffects>Somebody could have switched Trucy's rubber sword with a metal one...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
After the set piece fell, everybody in the audience was kicked out of the theater. In the ensuing chaos, somebody could have carried out a <textEffects>cover-up operation</textEffects>. Any one of the stagehands or show personnel could've done it before the police arrived.
</line><line>Athena:
So what you're saying is... ...somebody's <textEffects>actively trying to frame Trucy</textEffects> for the crime?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, some disgusting individual is trying to get away with murder.
</line><line>Athena:
So it's someone related to the show...
</line><line>Apollo:
There's definitely a very high chance of that. <textEffects>(Now, if we could just figure out who it is...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Let's see. What else do we need to do on this stage? Ema, did you find any <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> on the <textEffects>coffin</textEffects>?
</line><line>Ema:
Actually, I haven't checked yet. I was going to do that at the end. I like to save the best for last!
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, we aren't exactly talking about dessert here.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, but we are! Would you like to partake in my delicious dessert? I don't mind sharing.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, yes, please! There's always room for dessert, right?!
</line><line>Apollo:
All right... I guess I'll join you two.
</line><line>Apollo:
So, could you show us how you check for prints, Ema?
</line><line>Ema:
Sure. Let's start with the basics. As you know, fingerprints are an excellent way of identifying someone. That's because no two people have the same set of fingerprints -- not even twins.
</line><line>Apollo:
So if we find any prints on the coffin, they might lead us to the killer.
</line><line>Ema:
If the culprit was dumb enough to leave prints behind -- sure. Let's go ahead and <textEffects>dust for prints now.</textEffects> Let's see... This looks like a promising spot. Try dusting the area with <textEffects>fingerprint powder</textEffects>. Keep <textEffects>tapping</textEffects> the <textEffects>Touch Screen</textEffects> until the powder covers the surface thoroughly. When you're done, <textEffects>blow into the mic</textEffects> to get rid of the excess powder. The powder in this bottle is all we have to work with. If you run out, try blowing into the mic. Any excess powder will be returned to the bottle.
</line><line>Apollo:
All right. I think I'm ready to give it a try.
</line><line>Ema:
You found some prints. Looks like the fingers of somebody's left hand. Now, let's try comparing these with the ones we have on file. First, touch "<textEffects>Analyze</textEffects>" (L) to select a print. Next, select the print you want to analyze and touch "<textEffects>Confirm</textEffects>" (X).
</line><line>Apollo:
I've got a pretty clear print here. I wonder whose it is.
</line><line>Ema:
I have the prints of everyone involved in the case right here. Just choose the person whose prints you'd like to compare the sample against.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Well, the last person who was in the coffin was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
Bingo. Looks like the prints belong to the deceased, Mr. Reus.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, if we found prints here... ...maybe we can find them elsewhere on the coffin, too. <textEffects>(Guess I'll try dusting for more prints.)</textEffects>
</line>




</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Apollo:
There. I found some!
</line><line>Ema:
These prints are apparently Mr. Reus's, too. Shall we try looking for prints on the outside of the coffin now?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, let's.
</line><line>Ema:
This time, you'll be able to rotate the coffin and look at it from different angles. That'll give you a chance to examine it thoroughly. If you ever get stuck or confused... ...you can always touch "<textEffects>Reset</textEffects>."
</line><line>Apollo:
Okay. And if I find any prints, I'll choose one to run against your data -- just like before.
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>







</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Ema:
It looks like that's about all the prints we're going to find. To sum everything up, the prints we found belong to... ...the victim <textEffects>Mr. Reus</textEffects>, the bunny assistant <textEffects>Bonny</textEffects>... ...and some third, <textEffects>unidentified person</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
But that's strange. We didn't see anybody else up there on that stage during the show... Does this mean some outsider was up there -- somebody unrelated to the show?
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm... I guess we can't really say at this point...
</line><line>Ema:
Well, thank goodness we didn't find any of Trucy's fingerprints, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(But that's only because Trucy was wearing gloves.)</textEffects> Hey, Ema, there's something else that's been bothering me about the prints... Don't you think there's something odd about Mr. Reus's prints?
</line><line>Ema:
Odd? What's odd about them?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, if Mr. Reus was standing in the coffin facing forward... ...he would've left prints like this, right? But when we look at the actual prints... ...they're <textEffects>facing backwards</textEffects>. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
</line><line>Ema:
Hey, what do you know! You're right! I wonder how they wound up like that.
</line><line>Athena:
Maybe he was accidentally facing the wrong way at first, but then turned around later?
</line><line>Apollo:
No, the coffin is much too small for a guy his size to turn around in. About all he would've been able to manage is maybe a little bit of twisting.
</line><line>Athena:
Then it really doesn't make any sense, does it!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I think I might've hit on something major here...)</textEffects> ......Oh, I have just one more question, Ema.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, yeah? What is it?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Reus was stabbed in the back, right? But if he was standing in the coffin like this... ...how would that have worked?
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, right. That. The lead prosecutor has an explanation, actually. He thought that the victim might've tried to dodge the sword as it came into the coffin... ...so maybe he twisted his body and the sword ended up stabbing him in the back. That's his theory, anyway.
</line><line>Apollo:
I see... <textEffects>(I guess that sounds plausible...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Fingerprinting Results added to the Court Record.</textEffects>

<line>Apollo:
Well, guess that about wraps up our investigation of the stage.
</line><line>Athena:
Actually... there's still the area <textEffects>behind that curtain</textEffects>... Don't you want to know what's back there?
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure do. But Ema told us not to move or touch anything, remember? ............
</line><line>Ema:
............Would you quit staring at me?! Fine. I'll go open it for you.
</line><line>Athena:
Wow, look at you, flaunting your lady-killer eyes.
</line><line>Apollo:
A-ha ha. I have my ways!
</line><line>Ema:
I'm only doing this so I won't get charged with animal abuse for not throwing you a bone.
</line><line>Athena:
I guess puppy eyes can be just as effective.
</line><line>Apollo:
............
</line><line>Ema:
All right, I'll be back. Well, go on and investigate to your hearts' content. But before you go moving anything...
</line><line>Apollo:
I know, I know -- we'll be sure to ask first.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, by the way... Just "<textEffects>Examine</textEffects>" the backstage to move to the area beyond the curtain.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Okay! Time to get investigating!)</textEffects>

Pretty much. There's just one thing: The door to the <textEffects>understage passage</textEffects> was locked. Any way we can get down there?
</line><line>Ema:
That place? They locked it up as soon as we police finished our investigation down there. If you want to check it out, you'll have to ask a magician.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Trucy's at the detention center, so she can't help us. I guess we'll have to look for somebody else from the show.
</line><line>Ema:
Okay. And I'd better get back to my own investigation. See you around.
</line><line>Apollo:
It's too bad about the understage area, but at least we learned a few things.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, like one of your greatest fears, heh heh!
</line><line>Apollo:
I-I wasn't talking about that... I meant how all the behind-the-scenes stuff is set up. Let's see...&amp; We found out there are <textEffects>two winches</textEffects> backstage. <textEffects>Mr. Hat</textEffects> was rigged to the first winch... ...and the <textEffects>dragon set piece</textEffects> was attached to the other one.
</line><line>Athena:
And both of them were used during the show. Right after the body was discovered, the dragon set piece fell to the stage.
</line><line>Apollo:
And in the chaos that ensued... ...the culprit could have switched the rubber sword with the real one. <textEffects>(So it looks like the best way to prove Trucy's innocence... ...is to identify the real killer.)</textEffects>

Thank you, Mr. Thief.

</line><line>Bonny:
T-Trucy's lawyers? Oh! I'm so sorry I called you thieves!
</line><line>Apollo:
If you really thought we were thieves, why were you still doing magic tricks for us?
</line><line>Bonny:
I can't help it. Whenever anybody asks, I just can't bring myself to refuse...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Does that mean she's a real people-person or that she aims to please a little too hard?)</textEffects>

In that case, can you tell us the secret to your teleportation trick?
</line><line>Bonny:
W-Well... I don't know if I should... Oooh.
</line><line>Athena:
If I keep up the pressure, she just might tell us! I've been dying to know!
</line><line>Apollo:
Leave the poor girl alone.
</line><line>Bonny:
Are you... investigating the case...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, that's right.
</line><line>Bonny:
I'm Trucy's biggest fan! I just love her to bits! I'd do anything to help her!

We appreciate that. In that case, would you mind if we asked you a few questions?

<line>Apollo:
Bonny, when you said, "<textEffects>perform it perfectly</textEffects>"... ...your right hand would tremble and move your hat a tiny bit. I even caught a glimpse of the little rabbit hiding underneath.
</line><line>Bonny:
Ulp!

O-Of course! I definitely got THAT part right!

<textEffects>(And the Ratings Rajah?)</textEffects> What did we have to hide for, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Because I heard something funny. There was something off in their voices...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Oh, right. Athena's super-sensitive hearing...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bonny:
Those lawyers are poking around, trying to stir up trouble. Should I be worried?
</line><line>Retinz:
Relax! I didn't say anything to the police, and I won't say anything to them, either.
</line><line>Bonny:
You better not! Or you're gonna get it! POW! Right in the kisser!
</line><line>Apollo:
What the...? Is it just me or does Bonny seem kinda different from before?
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo, shhh!
</line><line>Bonny:
I'm sick and tired of this whole investigation! All I want is Trucy's head on a platter!
</line><line>Retinz:
Heh heh. Leave everything to me, babe. Don't forget the power of mass media! TV can accomplish anything! I'll make sure Trucy gets much worse than a guilty verdict!
</line><line>Bonny:
I can't wait to see that girl crying and begging for mercy.
</line><line>Retinz:
You really hate Trucy, don't you, bunny?
</line><line>Bonny:
I hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hey! What the heck...?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bonny:
If you mess this up, you're gonna really be sorry. You hear me? I'll crush you flat. Like a cockroach under my foot!
</line><line>Retinz:
Oh, you KYOOT widdle thing! You're so adooorwable when you're thwowing a fit! OW! OW! My foot! C-Can't you take a joke?
</line><line>Bonny:
C'mon! Grab my things! We're leaving!
</line><line>Retinz:
D'awwwwwww. Lead the hippity-hopping way, my little bun-bun!
</line><line>Athena:
............
</line><line>Apollo:
............
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What was that absolutely revolting scene all about?
</line><line>Apollo:
I guess the entertainment industry attracts all kind of eccentrics... But that conversation... ;It set off every red flag in the book.
</line><line>Athena:
You said it! I smell "plot" with a capital "P.U."!
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm... Retinz claims he was at the TV station at the time of the incident... ...and we saw Bonny onstage ourselves.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey, Apollo, I have an idea. Why don't we pay <textEffects>Take-2 TV</textEffects> a visit? We can check up on the Rating Rajah's alibi while we're there.
</line><line>Apollo:
Sounds like a plan.

<line>Athena:
Yikes! Look at this place!
</line><line>Apollo:
There's so much going on at once, it's making my head spin.
</line><line>Athena:
Take a look at that screen! And listen to those hosts! "<textEffects>Magical Murder! Live audience witnesses shocking skewering!</textEffects>" " <textEffects>17-Year-Old Magician, Trucy Wright!</textEffects>" "<textEffects>See exclusive, unedited footage of the heinous crime -- complete and uncut!</textEffects>" We can't let them broadcast that! Trucy will get tried in the court of public opinion!
</line><line>Apollo:
I doubt we can stop them from airing it... ...but we can prove her innocence in a realcourt of law! No matter what garbage they report on TV, we can set the record straight at the trial!

Looks like we're pretty much done here. Should we go back to the office? We can get a snack and talk over our plan of attack.

Sounds good to me.

All these stickers say "<textEffects>REPOSSESSED</textEffects>"...
</line><line>Apollo:
Who did this? Who's responsible for this?!
</line><line>???:
Whoa, now! This is a restricted area, champ! No trespassing!
</line><line>Apollo:
"Trespassing"?! But this is our office! You're the one who's trespassing!
</line><line>Retinz:
Enough with the lip, boy. Don't tell me you forgot about your debt?
</line><line>Athena:
Wh-What are you talking about?!
</line><line>Retinz:
I'm just abiding by the contract. If the agency can't pay me, I have every right to seize its property, am I right?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Just like that?! We haven't even had a chance to take this to trial!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Retinz:
Heh heh. If you're gonna be mad, shouldn't Trucy be the one you're mad at? I told you. It serves you right for getting involved with those Gramaryes!

Now then, you gotta be outta here by tomorrow. Take in this cozy little office tonight while you still can! Heh heh. Hang loose, baby!

I... I can't believe we let Mr. Wright's office get placed under seizure! Of all the--!

*huff, huff, huff, huff* I can't believe this is happening...!

<textEffects>A-A-Apollo!!! I got your messages! How is she?! Is Trucy okay?! S-She's not crying, is she?! Does she have a lawyer?!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
M-M-Mr. Wright!!! It's all a giant mess! Poor Trucy...! And the office...! Our office...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>A-Apollo...? Okay, okay. We'd better both take a deep breath...</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Wow... I see... And he's saying you have to be out by tomorrow?</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... I wish there was something I could've done...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This... is quite the mess, isn't it? Even if I left right now, I wouldn't be there in time for the trial tomorrow. I'm sorry, Apollo, but I need you to handle this for me.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
O-Of course! We can handle the defense, but the office...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>It's too soon to give up on that!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The contract only addresses Trucy's liability if she causes the show to be canceled. So you just have to prove in court tomorrow that it wasn't Trucy's fault.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...Hey, you're right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>So everything depends on your winning that trial tomorrow. Trucy's fate... and the fate of our office. It's all riding on your shoulders, Apollo.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...I-I know... <textEffects>(I-I'll be... fine... right?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>............Apollo!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I can say, with absolute confidence... that you'll be fine.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
R-Really?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I've seen you earn victory after victory in some pretty dicey situations... ...and guide Athena -- helping her along her way, too. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Th-Thank you, Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Good luck tomorrow!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...Thank you! I'm... I'm fine! Everything will be fine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>You can call me anytime if you feel you need to, but...</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
...But I'll be fine on my own, right? Yes, I think so, too. I can do this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>That's the spirit. Give it your best out there, Apollo!</textEffects>

I couldn't agree more! And I'll do everything in my power to help!
