That guy... betrayed...
</line><line>???:
No.. can't be... Then the deal...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...split... police...
</line><line>???:
...Alright...
</line><line>???:
...in front of... meet up...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Where am I...? <textEffects>(How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernesst Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of.

<line>Edgeworth:
.................. <textEffects>(I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...)</textEffects> ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!
</line><line>???:
Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers?
</line><line>???:
A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. <textEffects>(Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Great Thief? <textEffects>(And did she really just claim to be the <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me "Kay", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes.
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..................
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What a relief. I owe you my thanks.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Kay:
So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth.
</line><line>Kay:
Aha! Now I remember!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...How can you "remember" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side.
</line><line>Kay:
What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room...
</line><line>Kay:
Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out.

<line>Edgeworth:
This hook on this beam...
</line><line>Kay:
You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose.
</line><line>Kay:
Really!? Like what!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! I get it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp.
</line><line>Kay:
Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath!
</line>

<line>Kay:
Now THIS is what I call a treasure!

<line>Edgeworth:
I believe you're up, Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? Why me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ack! Wait!
</line><line>Kay:
Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you alright!? Kay!?
</line><line>Kay:
I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
There's a lot of really large machinery down here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What about an exit?
</line><line>Kay:
Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know.
</line><line>Kay:
No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?">ladder is removable</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)</textEffects></span>!?

<line>Edgeworth:
I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh? So, how are we going to bust out?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all.
</line><line>Kay:
...Are you actually praising me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
More of a "thank you" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder.
</line><line>Kay:
The underground ladder? What about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down...
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! I see! If we use this...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers.
</line><line>Kay:
Well, then what are we waiting for!?

Alright! Now we can get out of here!

Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. <textEffects>(Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
It looks like it's stopped raining for now.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Well, that's... um...
</line><line>MIB:
Count off!
</line><line>1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8!
</line>
<hr />
<line>98! 99!
</line><line>MIB:
Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir!
</line><line>???:
Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!?
</line><line>Shifu! Shifu!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You're Agent Lang, I take it?
</line><line>MIB:
You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!?
</line><line>Lang:
Grr! Lang Zi says: "A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder." So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return.
</line><line>Lang:
You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.)</textEffects> Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case?
</line><line>Lang:
That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How is it not!?
</line><line>Lang:
I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!?
</line><line>Lang:
The comedic relief jumps to the aide of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Lang:
I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Hicks...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Hicks was investigating a <span style="color:#E16935">smuggling ring</textEffects> with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.)</span> In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation...

</line><line>Lang:
This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You...! You dare to mock the court!?
</line><line>Lang:
I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy "prosecutor". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who uses the adjective "filthy" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed!
</line><line>Sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-Wait!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.)</textEffects>

Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Amano?
</line><line>Ernest:
Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system.
</line><line>Ernest:
No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
............
</line><line>Ernest:
If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time.
</line><line>Kay:
So who's the old man?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano.
</line><line>Ernest:
Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano.
</line><line>Ernest:
Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run.
</line><line>Ernest:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Kay:
Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

.................. Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself.

Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy.

Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating!

<line>Gumshoe:
So what should we examine first!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
OK! Let's get looking!
</line><line>Detective:
Hey! You there!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Who, me!?
</line><line>Detective:
What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation.
</line><line>Detective:
You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police.
</line><line>Detective:
Good, now let's go!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
</line><line>Detective:
Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents!
</line><line>Kay:
Well, that was exciting.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
............ Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I don't recall offering you the position.
</line><line>Kay:
Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of "assistant" a while back!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hah. You're the only one asserting that.
</line><line>Kay:
Well! By the time everyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about!
</line><line>Kay:
Fine. Whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along to matter what you say!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.
</line><line>Meekins:
Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises!
</line><line>Meekins:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!?
</line><line>Kay:
Then, that would mean that there are <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="A 2nd Blue Badger - There&#39;s only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.">two Blue Badgers</textEffects></span><textEffects> (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.)</textEffects></span> walking around!

<line>Edgeworth:
Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on new, and very significant meaning.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers.
</line><line>Kay:
OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting!
</line>

<line>Kay:
Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They both do look like possible candidates.
</line><line>Kay:
This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium...
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits!
</line><line>Meekins:
Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume.
</line><line>Kay:
Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage.

SIR! Roger Wilco, sir!

Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase "inner monologue", huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be friend of Lance?
</line><line>Paups:
Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
His girlfriend...?
</line><line>Paups:
Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon*
</line><line>Kay:
Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here?
</line><line>Paups:
I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here.
</line><line>Kay:
Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself!
</line><line>Paups:
Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true.
</line><line>Paups:
Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now...
</line><line>Kay:
Looks like she's gonna back to the "fair maiden in love" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here?

</line><line>Lang:
My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you.
</line><line>Lang:
I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Suspect? Who...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us.
</line><line>Meekins:
What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!?
</line><line>Lang:
Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's your answer!?
</line><line>Lang:
I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Lang:
All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake!
</line><line>Lang:
"Innocent people"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes!
</line><line>Lang:
Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!?
</line><line>MIB:
You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!?
</line><line>Lang:
Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: "Every pack has its own rules." If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic!

<line>Lang:
I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time.
I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right?
With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun.
Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
That is your reasoning...?
</line><line>Lang:
Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment!
</line><line>Kay:
Um... What's this "philosophy of detainment"?
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: "Beware of the wolf."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why the wolf...?
</line><line>Lang:
Because in my language, "lang" means "wolf", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, <textEffects>Lang Zi</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is that famous...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies.
</line><line>Kay:
But "thousands of years ago"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world?
</line><line>Lang:
......You want to put it to a test?

<textEffects>Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins.
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. <textEffects>(Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately for you, Agent Lang, that is simply not possible.
</line><line>Lang:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You've seen the crime scene for yourself. And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little to clean?
</line><line>Lang:
Aiya!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight!
</line><line>Lang:
Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Weird? How so?
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doinㅎ neglecting your duties and loafing around here?
</line><line>Meekins:
I-I...!
</line><line>Lang:
Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, "I found myself taking a walk."
</line><line>Meekins:
But sir... I really did take a walk, sir!
</line><line>Lang:
You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Meekins:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir!

<line>Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell such transparent lies.
</line><line>Meekins:
SIR!? I'm lying, sir!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, you are. If you were really out there selling dreams with the Blue Badgermobile until recently... ...then what is it doing here inside the garage?
</line><line>Meekins:
Aaaaaaah! A-Actually, I had just lost track, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Lost track of what?
</line><line>Meekins:
By the time I realized it, the Blue Badgermobile was nowhere to be found, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Which would mean it was perhaps... stolen?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what exactly is so convenient about his story?
</line><line>Lang:
The car getting stolen; it's completely unbelievable, even for a cover story! But I think we can assume the car was used alright. To move the dead body!
</line><line>Meekins:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Lang:
You killed the victim at some distant location, Officer Meekins. And then you used the Blue Badgermobile to transport it all the way here.

</line><line>Lang:

Of course I do. How have you been? You look to be in good spirits. Are you still studying abroad?

You bet! More than anything, I want to investigate crime scenes, scientifically! I've been studying non-stop every day to become a top-notch forensic scientist! But it's spring break now, so I thought I'd come back for a bit.

<center><textEffects>-- What Oldbag Witnessed --</textEffects></center>
<line>Oldbag:
<textEffects>I came to this stadium to take a short break.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Oldbag:
<textEffects>As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Oldbag:
<textEffects>Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Oldbag:
<textEffects>It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation...
</line><line>Kay:
...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. It's all becoming clear to me. Let's clear up this issue with some well-presented evidence, and get this over with.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Two men? How did you know the gender of the two people involved... ...seeing as how the victim was wearing a costume at the time!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Ah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Furthermore, I have another matter I'd like to inquire about! I'd very much like to know... ...why you failed to mention the costume in your testimony!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Uwah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm beginning to doubt if you really witnessed the murder at all.
</line><line>Oldbag:
But I'm telling you, I really did see it! I saw it with my very own eyes! ...From a seat in the second tier.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The second tier...?
</line><line>Kay:
Hey, didn't you say you saw it "right in front of you" earlier?
</line><line>Oldbag:
That was... you know... I was using the phrase in the metaphorical sense...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(*sigh* I see our witness still has a screw loose, in the metaphorical sense.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Oldbag:
The cushy seats in the second tier are reserved for hot-shot VIPs. Which is exactly why I go there now and again to take a nap!
</line><line>Kay:
I can't see how you could've gotten a good look from there. It's so high up!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Were you able to see even the victim's costume from way up there?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Well, I know I saw two people. But I couldn't really see what they looked like because they were in the <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage&#39;s window.">stage's shadow</textEffects></span><textEffects> (In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage's window.)</textEffects></span>. My sight isn't what it used to be, you know. Not like when I was young. Ah, people used to call me "Eagle-Eyed Wendy" back then! could spot a good man from 100 paces away as I walked down the street, just like that! Of course, they also noticed me in a flash and tried to make their move. But I'm not that easy! I was a careful girl with a judgmental eye! Bu

<line>Edgeworth:
If that woman's testimony is to be believed... ...the murder occurred before the stage was broken down.
</line><line>Kay:
Do you want me to input that bit of info into Little Thief?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, if you please.
</line><line>Kay:
OK!
</line>
<hr />


<line>Edgeworth:
There is clearly...
</line><line>Kay:
...A contradiction here!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please stop stealing my lines!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see it coming, even for a layman like me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose. In any case, it's not possible for the killer to have stood here in that way... ...because there was a very real stage set up in this spot at that time.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeesh, I told you I got it! Do you feel the need to explain everything!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, well... In any case, we still need to resolve this unusual situation.
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't it obvious? The killer was on top of the stage, naturally. Right, Ms. Oldbag!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Yes! I remember now! The killer was standing on top of the stage!
</line><line>Kay:
See! Now let me update the info in the simulation.

<line>Lang:
Well, well, what have we here? A bunch of hooligans running amok, I see!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, how nice of you to join us.
</line><line>Lang:
Well, I can't have you going around messing up my crime scenes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, we've discovered that the real scene of the murder is here, the stadium.
</line><line>Lang:
I see. Thanks.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For what?
</line><line>Lang:
I'm just trying to show you my appreciation for all the time you saved me. Who knew that such a strange little toy could re-create a crime scene like that.
</line><line>Kay:
Little Thief is NOT a toy!
</line><line>Lang:
...You two!
</line><line>Sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
And there you have it. You see? Big boys like me don't need silly toys, little girl.
</line><line>Kay:
*sigh*
</line><line>Lang:
Now THIS is a re-creation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So what? Do you still intend to assert that Officer Meekins is the killer?
</line><line>Lang:
Of course. Even knowing that the crime took place here doesn't let him off the hook.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Agent Lang's Logic --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
This is the real scene of the crime.
Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage.
And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high!
That's the truth your little re-creation showed.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
How far will you go to accuse Officer Meekins of the crime...?
</line><line>Lang:
He's the most likely suspect we've got, especially given the situation with his gun.
</line><line>Kay:
Well, even if he is the killer, at least my re-creation was on the mark.
</line><line>Lang:
You see? Thank you for understanding, my little crow-girl.
</line><line>Kay:
Grr... I'm not some common crow! I'm the Yatagarasu! The raven of legend!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, your conclusion has yet to be tested, so let's see how well it holds up.

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage.</textEffects>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high!</textEffects>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>That's the truth your little re-creation showed.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation.
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, not quite. <textEffects>(I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole-truth?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I'm terribly sorry, Agent Lang.
</line><line>Lang:
?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I should have you warned you that our re-creation is <textEffects>incomplete</textEffects>. You cut in quite unexpectedly, after all.
</line><line>Lang:
What's that supposed to mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You said that the victim was shot by the killer from up above, correct? I hate to break it to you, but that's not possible.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? Why not?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Recall Mr. Deacon's body, specifically, where the gunshot wounds were located.
</line><line>Kay:
.................. Actually, I didn't get that good of a look.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh. Well then. The bullet entered Mr. Deacon in his <textEffects>abdominal region</textEffects>, and exited his <textEffects>right shoulder</textEffects>. This is more consistent with an <textEffects>angled shot from beneath</textEffects> the victim.
</line><line>Lang:
Kngh!
</line><line>Kay:
Then...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, our re-creation had the victim being shot <textEffects>at an angle from above</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
A clear contradiction!
</line><line>Lang:
You're discounting your own conclusions!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, this one point is the only flaw. This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Yes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong.
</line><line>Lang:
Ah, I get it. I see what you're trying to say!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe the killer and the victim were standing opposite to what we initially thought. It was the victim who was on top of the stage as he as being shot by the killer!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If this is what happened, it'd also explain the positioning of the gunshot wounds.
</line><line>Kay:
But then, what about the footprints?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Since footprints don't lie, we can assume then, that the killer also wore a costume.
</line><line>Kay:
OK! I'll try using that data instead!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Judging by the fact that both the killer and the victim were wearing costumes... ...I'd say it was a killing between the two kidnappers. That would be the most natural conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Agent Lang?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Hmph. Well done, Mr. Prosecutor! But that alone doesn't clear Officer Meekins of the crime!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Another Bit of Proof --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
I ask that you take another good look at the tire marks over there.
The three marks are indicative of the Blue Badgermobile.
That story Officer Meekins told about that shop on wheels getting stolen was just a lie.
He drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder.
Then, he used the car to move the body to the garage in the Wild, Wild West Area.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
You believe he moved the body with the car?
</line><line>Lang:
That's right. It was Officer Meekins himself who pointed us to the way he did it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, Agent Lang, but that's an impossible tale.
</line><line>Lang:
And why is that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Those tire marks could not have been left by Officer Meekins's Blue Badgermobile! One look at the car would've told you so! <textEffects>What proves that the Blue Badgermobile had never been to this stadium?</textEffects>
</line>




<line>Edgeworth:
Take a good look at the tires. There's not a single dollop of <textEffects>mud</textEffects> to be found on it.
</line><line>Lang:
Nngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If this car had come to the backstage area and left those tire tracks... ...then the lack of mud on these tires stands out as very peculiar indeed.
</line><line>Lang:
Then, how do you explain the tire tracks, genius?
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! I've got it! What about Ms. Oldbag's Pink Badgermobile!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Don't be ridiculous! I was sleeping the entire time in the second tier seats!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, I believe we can rule her out as someone related to the crime. However, there is yet one more roving store, as I recall.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! You mean the Proto Badger!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. There was one more parking space inside that garage. And it proves the existence of a Proto Badgermobile.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Agent Lang, I suggest you find this Proto Badgermobile posthaste. There must still be some sort of incriminating evidence in it.
</line><line>Lang:
Nngh.........
</line><line>???:
H.........
</line><line>Kay:
Hey, did you hear something?
</line><line>???:
H.........Hel...... ...Help... me...
</line><line>Kay:
Are you alright!?
</line><line>Lang:
Well, this is something! Looks like we've found our kidnapping victim. Where were you all this time?
</line><line>Lance:
Wild West... With kidnappers...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He was in the room next to the one I was held in!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lance:
Ran away using underground... and get lost... Th-The kidnappers...
</line><line>Lang:
Hm? What is it!? I can't understand what you're trying to say!
</line><line>Lance:
Th-The kidnappers... escaped... wearing costumes...
</line><line>Lang:
Did you see the faces of your kidnappers!?
</line><line>Lance:
No... I didn't see their faces... but... two... One was a w-woman...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A woman...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Quite an important piece of testimony. Hey, what are you guys doing!? Stop standing there and get your cops on this already. I'll even let you guys have what the kid said just now. Consider it a gift. Now, are you going to get out of my crime scene, or am I going to have to get rough?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Akgn... <textEffects>(Again...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
You're nothing but a big bully! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go!
</line><line>Lang:
Oh, no, no, no. Not you. You're a very important witness for my case. I'm not about to let you get away that easily.
</line><line>Ema:
Don't count on me to testify, because I won't. Not for you!
</line><line>Oldbag:
That's right! I won't either! You hear me, you young whippersnapper!
</line><line>Lang:
Hey, calm down. There's no need for all this hostility. I just want to take a statement from each of you. I'm not going to rough either of you up. I give you my word. Come now, fair maidens. What do you say? Will you cooperate?
</line><line>Oldbag:
"Fair maidens"...? My, you little rascal! You sure know the way into a woman's heart.
</line><line>Lang:
Lang Zi says: "The passage of time is but a fleeting moment," and a lady is young forever.
</line><line>Oldbag:
..Hmph! Trying to outdo my Edgey-poo with your fancy-schmancy sayings. Let's get this over with. So we're clear, I'm only interested in giving you my statement.

We already established that there's a good chance that the killer is the other kidnapper. It's my duty to figure out who this other person is. I believe there is one location that might hold a clue or two.

The obvious location is the kidnappers' hideout.
</line><line>Kay:

Agent Lang and his men should be done with this area. In that case, there is no harm in asking that officer over there to let us in.

<line>Edgeworth:
What did you mean by "a Bad Badger costume is missing"?
</line><line>Proto B.:
Why, just what I said, sir. We are one Bad Badger short. Counting the spares, we have two of each costume on hand at all time.
</line><line>Kay:
OK, so because one of them is walking around in the park...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...The other should be in that room.
</line><line>Proto B.:
Ah, actually, both of them should be in that room.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Proto B.:
Normally, we don't use the Bad Badger costumes. In fact, we only use them during a certain event at a set time each day. It's the stage show where the Bad Badger wreaks havoc around the park... ...and the other Badgers must work together to apprehend him, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I'm speechless that such a show exists.
</line><line>Proto B.:
Well, sir, I was just trying to explain to you the only time we use that costume.
</line><line>Kay:
Then doesn't that make it near-impossble to take a picture of the Bad Badger!?
</line><line>Proto B.:
Personally, I can't believe that it's this close to show time and there's no costume! Oh, dear. What am I to do, sir!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All this is basically means is that the kidnappers stole <textEffects>four costumes</textEffects> in total.
</line><line>Kay:
Then, are you saying that there are <textEffects>four kidnappers</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, I don't think that's very likely.

Oh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Recall the costumes for a minute.

<textEffects>What proves that a fourth kidnapper does not exist?</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
If you had four people, and you had wanted to steal a fourth costume... ...wouldn't you naturally go for the full set and steal a Pink Badger costume instead?
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, that makes sense!

Precisely. The Bad Badger was designed to always hold a gun in his right hand. However... You there! Did you remove the gun from this Bad Badger's right hand?
</line><line>Proto B.:
No, I did not, sir. The gun is supposed to be securely attached to the costume.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As I thought. The rip itself confirms my hypothesis that the gun was forcibly removed. Mr. Proto Badger, the gun is, of course, not a functioning weapon, correct?
</line><line>Proto B.:
Ab-SO-lutely not, sir. It's just a model gun. However, it can fire blanks. We need to use them for the stage show.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that our kidnappers also had a need for the model gun, my dear costumed friend.

I think we're about done with this room.
</line><line>Kay:
So, what's next?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, we found new answers... ...but there are still a few things left that we have to ask a certain person about. Let's go, Kay!

<line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir! You've gotta hurry, sir! Come on!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is it, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
They found a Blue Badger costume down in front of the main gate, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't that what one of the kidnappers was wearing!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Bingo! That's why you've gotta come to the main gate with me right now! If we hurry, we still might be able to get there before Wolf-boy does, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Alright. Let's make haste to the main gate!
