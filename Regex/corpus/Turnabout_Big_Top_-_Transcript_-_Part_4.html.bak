<line>Maya:
Good morning, Max.
</line><line>Max:
Oh... Yeah... Good morning, sweeties...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't seem like you're<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> usual sparkling self today.
</line><line>Max:
I'm always like this before I go in front of an audience... I'm working up to it.
</line><line>???:
Tee hee...
</line><line>Regina:
Don't get nervous, Maxy... Here, have a glass of milk.
</line><line>Maya:
R-Regina!!
</line><line>Max:
How fabulous!! My sweetie pie!! My sweetie pie princess!! You came to watch my performance today?
</line><line>Regina:
Of course I did! Moe told me that I should come and watch this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Moe said that...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Regina:
So, what kind of performance will you put on today? Lemme guess, you'll fly at the end?
</line><line>Max:
Uh... It's not kind of show... Isn't that right, my sweeties?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Max:
I think my sweetie pie princess doesn't...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. She doesn't seem to realize what's going on... Or even where she is...
</line><line>Max:
Hmm...
</line><line>Regina:
Well, Max, it looks like it's time to raise the curtain. I'll see you later. Today I'm just a member of the audience!
</line><line>Max:
F-Fabulous! Enjoy yourself out there!!
</line><line>Regina:
Good luck Max! You're the best!!
</line><line>Maya:
Regina's different, don't you think, Nick?
</line><line>Moe:
Top of the morning to ya! Everybody... Let's get ready to get stuck in legal limbo! How low can you go?
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Moe.
</line><line>Moe:
Top of the morning to ya, guv'ner.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhh... Top of the morning.
</line><line>Moe:
That's the ticket! Attacking the day starts with energy in the morning! The early bird gets the worm. But then again, worms lack higher brain function. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Here Max! I brought you a present! Have some milk.
</line><line>Max:
Oh my! Thank you!!
</line><line>Moe:
So how are you today, Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... I've got the feeling that today I'm going to face off against the real criminal.
</line><line>Moe:
You mean Acro?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh!? You think he did it...?
</line><line>Moe:
Be careful... He's used to putting his life on the line. Literally. He's got guts to spare.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...
</line><line>Maya:
What are you going to do then, Nick!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.
</line><line>Maya:
You're right... But it's gonna be tough...
</line><line>Moe:
Anyways... I want you to make sure that Regina see it all today. It's important. Then she'll finally have to deal with the <textEffects>reality</textEffects> of what happened to her father.
</line><line>Maya:
You want us to make sure Regina watches?
</line><line>Moe:
Yes. That's why I brought her here to court today.
</line><line>Max:
What's that supposed to mean?
</line><line>Moe:
She need to know that when people die, they don't just become stars. I may be an old-fashioned clown, but I don't believe in people becoming stars.

<center><textEffects>December 30, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2</textEffects></center>
<line>Judge:
The court is now in session in the trial of Maximillion Galactica.
</line><line>von Karma:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Ms. von Karma, you may proceed with your case.
</line><line>von Karma:
The prosecution would like to revise it's<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> previous theory of events.
</line><line>Judge:
What's the meaning of this?
</line><line>von Karma:
We have discovered a new witness. Or shall I say, a new eyewitness. One that saw Maximillion Galactica fly off from the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! I had a feeling something like this would come up...
</line><line>von Karma:
Due to this revision, we are now prepared to explain how the defendant flew that night. An explanation the prosecution will present if the need so<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> arises... In fact, my detective stayed up all night creating a mockup of the scene, on my orders.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Poor Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... Please call your witness to the stand!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Time to get to work! Or shall I say, time to walk the courtroom tightrope...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
Name and occupation.
</line><line>Acro:
Ken Dingling, but everyone calls me Acro. I'm employed as an acrobat at the Berry Big Circus.
</line><line>von Karma:
Where were you the night of the crime?
</line><line>Acro:
I was in my room that night.
</line><line>von Karma:
If you look at the map, you will see the witness' room is near the crime scene.
</line><line>Acro:
My room is on the third floor. The crime scene is below my window.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>von Karma:
The night of the crime, the witness saw something quite shocking. Would you tell us what you witnessed?
</line><line>Acro:
OK...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What You Witnessed --</textEffects></center>
<line>Acro:
It was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.
Around that time, I heard a large "THUMP" noise from outside the window.
Then a few moments later, I saw someone... Flying... Right by my window.
It was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.
To be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... This witness' testimony matches up exactly with that of the clown.
</line><line>von Karma:
If that's the case, there is very little the prosecution need add... All that's left is to explain how the defendant disappeared into the sky that night.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Before we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
</line><line>von Karma:
A foolish choice by a foolish fool who wishes to feel the foolish sadness of a sad fool. A man must know the proper timing for things, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Just like your old friend, Mr. Miles Edgeworth did.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Do you have a problem with the witness' testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... "There's no way that actually happened!"
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... You may proceed with your cross-examination.

Acro must be lying about things, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.
</line><line>Maya:
Well, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?
</line><line>Acro:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>silk hat</textEffects>.
</line><line>Acro:
What about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.
</line><line>Acro:
That would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.
</line><line>Acro:
That... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Afraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.
</line><line>Judge:
Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which mean, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!

</line><line>von Karma:
Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...
</line><line>Maya:
Are you OK, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...
</line><line>Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!
</line><line>von Karma:
"On this occasion"...?
</line><line>Judge:
"A-A-Accuses Acro"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Obviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, are you serious!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Deadly serious, Your Honor.
</line><line>von Karma:
Ha ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Your Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.
</line><line>Judge:
R-Really...?
</line><line>von Karma:
If you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?
</line><line>Acro:
I don't really need to say a thing, do I?
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Acro:
Everyone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.
</line><line>Judge:
T-That's true...
</line><line>Acro:
I understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...
</line><line>von Karma:
See! Even a silver<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!
</line><line>She's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!
</line><line>von Karma:
See that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhh...
</line><line>von Karma:
I think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... "Acro had an accomplice!!"
</line><line>Judge:
What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?
</line>

<line>Judge:
You... You don't say!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Don't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-W-W-WHAT!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Oh... Did you hear that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hear what?
</line><line>von Karma:
The sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Foundation...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice?
</line>

<line>Judge:
... Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
This piece of evidence is lacking in persuasive power.
</line><line>von Karma:
You didn't miss that sound, did you Mr. Phoenix Wright? You know... The sound of you receiving a penalty!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Arrrrghhhh!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
What are you doing, Nick!?
</line><line><i>Leads back to:</i>
"What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?"
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>von Karma:
Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not this time, Von Karma.
</line><line>von Karma:
Wh... WHAT!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're not going to sucker me into this one.
</line><line>Judge:
What are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?
</line><line>Maya:
Way to keep them on their toes, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.
</line><line>Maya:
Can you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!
</line><line>Maya:
Alright! Then let's do it!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... <textEffects>When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
He was obviously here the entire time.
</line><line>Judge:
That's... Acro's room?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. There's only one answer to that... Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!
</line><line>von Karma:
What!? Are you nuts!?
</line><line>Judge:
What say you, Mr. Dingling!?
</line><line>Acro:
... It's an interesting theory.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Umm... That's it?
</line><line>Acro:
Considering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
As the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... You've got a point.
</line><line>von Karma:
It seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Maya:
That's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.
</line><line>Acro:
Do you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it?
</line><line>Acro:
I understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Be careful, Nick. If you mess up here...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Time to enlighten us as to how Mr. Dingling committed the crime, Mr. Wright!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I'm going to present some evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
So what did Mr. Dingling use to commit the crime of murder against Russell Berry?
</line>


<line>Judge:
What's that? A picture?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.
</line><line>Judge:
The bust?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also <textEffects>very very heavy</textEffects>.
</line><line>von Karma:
Heavy...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.
</line><line>von Karma:
AHHH!!
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
See! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! So you're saying the bust fell onto the Ringmaster!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
How could you possibly wheel a wheelchair with something so heavy!? It's impossible!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Acro is an acrobat! He should have more than enough upper body strength to carry something like the bust!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Dingling, how do you respond to these charges!?
</line><line>Acro:
Well...
</line><line>Maya:
Acro's at a loss for words!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He should be... He knows that I'm <span style="color:#E16935">getting close</textEffects> to the truth!)</span> Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
I'd watch what I say, if I were you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Your Honor! The physical health of the witness is material to this case! I demand that we get proper testimony from the witness himself!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Testimony you say...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Von Karma... She's just using this "testimony" as a rouse to stall for time!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>von Karma:
The defense has its version of the murder. The prosecution has the right to respond!
</line><line>Judge:
The defense's objection is overruled...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Dingling, I'm sorry, but we need you to testify about your physical condition. If you have any doubts about your ability to testify, we can request expert testimony.
</line><line>von Karma:
The witness will have no problems; however, let's all be respectful towards him.
</line><line>Acro:
Thank you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Acro's Physical State --</textEffects></center>
<line>Acro:
I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.
I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.
However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.
There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.
That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.
Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... I have no doubts in regards to this witness' testimony.
</line><line>von Karma:
It was impossible for him to lift the bust and carry it over to the window. Not to mention that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. A single false step would have lead to even more severe injuries.
</line><line>Judge:
That's what I was thinking. What is your opinion on the matter, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.
</line><line>von Karma:
He's simply stalling. It's shameful, really.

<textEffects>Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Acro is strong enough to <span style="color:#E16935">lift up the bust</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
The main problem is how he could have aimed for the Ringmaster's head.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... I wonder if he used some kind of tool to aim for the Ringmaster...?
</line><line>Maya:
That's the ticket, Nick! Show them what you've got!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have to be careful. I have to find something that fits perfectly with the case.
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... I don't remember us finding any sort of tool... But maybe we overlooked something...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Acro... You didn't really need to lean out of the window, did you?
</line><line>Acro:
What are you driving at, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You already knew ahead of time where the Ringmaster's head was going to be. Quite precisely I may add.

</line><line>von Karma:
Your silly hinting at things is pointless! Mr. Phoenix Wright! Enough stalling! How about you show us some evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But... But I did such a good job hinting...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes yes yes! Hurry up and explain things, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe you should take a look at this... The key point here is the "<textEffects>wooden box</textEffects>".
</line><line>Judge:
The same wooden box that the victim was found hunched over...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The same. The question is, who placed the wooden box here?
</line><line>von Karma:
Who...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When Ben and company saw the Ringmaster, they didn't see him holding the box. Which means... That this wooden box was already placed at the scene crime.<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I have to admit that your theory makes a lot of sense...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The moment that the bust came falling down... Was exactly the same moment that the Ringmaster lifted up <textEffects>this wooden box</textEffects>. Which means that the answer to all these questions is now crystal clear!
</line><line>von Karma:
You... You mean!
</line><line>Judge:
If the bust were to fall upon the <textEffects>point marked out by the wooden box</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There would be no way that it could miss the head of the victim!
</line><line>von Karma:
R-Really...!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! This is unbelievable!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Finally! Some of these loose ends are starting to tie themselves up! Now I just gotta keep going! And there's only one way to go from here... Forward.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So the next question I have is who placed that wooden box at the scene?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was Mr. Dingling, of course. He connected it to a rope, and then all he had to do was lower it down. OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Allow me to whip some sense into you! Mr. Phoenix Wright!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
OWWW!! OWWW!! OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
The Ringmaster's head could have been anywhere when he lifted the box!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's why the box was so specially made!
</line><line>von Karma:
S-S-Specially made?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Indeed! It had the most peculiar feature...
</line>



<line>Judge:
The box also has carrying handles on either side, doesn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is correct!! To lift up the box, you'd have to <textEffects>squat down</textEffects>! Which means... That no matter who you are, your head would be in approximately the same place!
</line><line>von Karma:
Fool!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Does she<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> even bother to listen to me anymore...?)</span>
</line><line>Acro:
I've heard what you've had to say...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Acro:
I must admit, I'm shocked at your imaginative skills.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-You... Did you drop it? Did you drop the bust onto the Ringmaster!?
</line><line>Acro:
What are you talking about!? Even if I had wanted to do such a thing, <textEffects>I couldn't</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What...!?
</line><line>Acro:
Mr. Wright... Do you recall the original location of this bust?
</line>


<line>Acro:
I'd like you to remember one important fact, Mr. Wright... I could not possibly leave the lodging house by myself.
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! That means...
</line><line>Acro:
You understand what I mean, don't you? I may very well have been able to drop the bust from my room. However, how would I have <textEffects>gotten the bust from the cafeteria to my room</textEffects>?
</line><line>von Karma:
You see, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Explain that! Don't forget... You said, "There was no accomplice!"
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arrrggghhh!
</line><line>von Karma:
Tell us exactly how the witness would have carried the bust from the cafeteria!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yep... We definitely have a problem here... But this is no place to get perplexed! I've got to get my wits about me and prove how things happened once and for all!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your explanation. How did the witness get the bust from the cafeteria back to his room?
</line>


<line>Judge:
A monkey?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Everyone knows Money... He loves shiny objects of any size.
</line><line>Judge:
For instance, he stole the ventriloquist's ring...
</line><line>von Karma:
So? Are you saying the witness had a monkey steal the bust?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course he didn't order the monkey to steal it!! The monkey stole it on his own and then brought it back home.
</line><line>Acro:
...!!
</line><line>Judge:
"Home"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Money lives in <textEffects>Acro's room</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
ACRO'S ROOM!?
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
But the bust was bronze, wasn't it? Bronze isn't all that shiny...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe you should put the whip down sometimes and read the Court Record!
</line><line>Judge:
My, those are some very nice cards he's holding.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, and they are made of platinum... which is very shiny!
</line><line>von Karma:
GWWWAAAAHHH!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro!! Money is a strong monkey, right!? It'd be easy for him to bring the bust back to your room!!
</line><line>Acro:
... If he wasn't able to handle himself, I'd be on the market for a new roommate.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! I SAID ORDER!! MS. VON KARMA!! Where is the bust in question at this moment!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Umm... Umm... Umm... I... Umm... I don't know. We're searching for it as we speak...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... This is a strange turn of events. If that monkey did not <textEffects>steal the bust</textEffects>... Then what happens to this case?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, in that event... Something else must have been used as the murder weapon.
</line><line>Maya:
Well... Hmm... Or maybe this bust was the murder weapon... But it was used by <textEffects>accident</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's possible. Maybe Acro saw Money's mountain of stolen goods and thought to use one of them.
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anyways... I think we've more than proven one critical fact. Namely, that it was entirely possible that Acro was the murderer!
</line><line>von Karma:
MORON!!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright's argument was so circular, I'm still a bit dizzy! However... His argument does hold water... There's no denying that. OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Don't seem so flamboozled! Especially by this fraud of an attorney!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Fraud...?
</line><line>von Karma:
You've forgotten the absolute most important thing, Mr. Phoenix Wright!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And what is that?
</line><line>von Karma:
You should know!! You forgot that your fraud of a magical client was spotted at the scene of the crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AHHHHH!!
</line><line>von Karma:
There is no reason to doubt the clown's testimony!
</line><line>Judge:
T-That's true! How do you respond to that, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Don't let her beat you now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I won't! This is my chance to <span style="color:#E16935">turn this trial around</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>von Karma:
When the murder occurred, there were <textEffects>two people</textEffects> at the scene of the crime! One was the victim, Russell Berry, and the other was the murderer himself! Answer this and only this, Mr. Phoenix Wright! The clown saw the murderer! <textEffects>Who was it then!?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
He saw Max's B-- OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
I asked who was the other person Moe saw on the scene! That evidence has nothing to do with the question!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Au contraire mon frére! It does indeed have something to do with the question!
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Moe said that he saw <textEffects>Max's</textEffects> silhouette... But he did not actually see the man himself! It <textEffects>wasn't a human being</textEffects> he saw!
</line><line>Judge:
H-H-How is that possible!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's simple, really. What Moe actually saw that night was <textEffects>Max's bust</textEffects>!
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
What are you talking about!? Have you tried using your brain at all in this case!? The silhouette he saw just happened to be wearing a cloak!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no reason why you couldn't attach a cloak to the <textEffects>bust</textEffects>! Or a cloak like that could easily get <textEffects>snagged on the bust</textEffects> if they came into contact.
</line><line>von Karma:
Idiot!! Who in their right mind would put a cloak on a bust!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It doesn't matter who put it on the bust!
</line><line>Judge:
Just wait a minute now, Mr. Wright! Who put the cloak on the bust? That question is of the utmost importance to this case, don't you agree!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Doh! He caught me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
So let's have it Mr. Wright... Who put the cloak on the bust?
</line>


<line>von Karma:
F-F-FOOL!! H-HIM...!?
</line><line>Judge:
You are saying it was the victim himself!? Russell Berry!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying!
</line><line>von Karma:
He... I mean, the victim himself, placed the cloak on the bust!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Placed the cloak" isn't really the right way of putting it...
</line><line>Judge:
Then what would be the right way of putting it, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>von Karma:
Explain yourself!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! Do you really have a handle on all of this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm fine, Maya. I'm finally putting all the pieces together... There's really only one picture I can paint, anyways. Alright... So you want to know what really happened that night? Let's step back in time. Acro used a rope to lower the <textEffects>wooden box</textEffects> onto the scene. Then he attached that rope to the <textEffects>bust</textEffects>, and dangled the bust out of his bedroom window, <textEffects>directly above the wooden box</textEffects>. At the same time, the Ringmaster told Max to wait in his room, and went to the scene. Of course, at the time, the Ringmaster was wearing <textEffects>Max's costume</textEffects>. Perhaps he didn't want anyone to recognize him that night. But just as he feared, he was spotted at the entrance of the lodging house. By none other than a ventriloquist and his puppet, Ben and Trilo. When the Ringmaster arrived at the scene, he bent over to lift the wooden box. And that's when Acro took his chance and released the rope! Now this is when the magic happens... At the very <textEffects>instant that the bust hit</textEffects> the victim...
</line><line>von Karma:
You just wait a second there, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! As much as you try... As much as you scheme... This just isn't true! It can't be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's still a little early to be getting so upset, Ms. von Karma... This circus isn't over yet.
</line><line>von Karma:
Eh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
With the shock of impact, it threw up the cloak and it got snagged onto the bust. That's when the sound was heard by a witness and he took a look out of his window. That witness was, of course, Lawrence "Moe" Curls, the clown. When Moe looked out his window, the cloak had already snagged onto the bust. Now... Having completed the crime, Acro naturally went about <textEffects>pulling up the murder weapon</textEffects>. Of course, he had no idea that <textEffects>Moe saw the bust</textEffects> being raised with the <textEffects>cloak dangling on it</textEffects>. Primarily because, in his wheelchair, he couldn't see out of his window. So he just kept pulling the bust up. And that is how the "magical" murderer disappearing into the sky came to be.
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>..................
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now you know how the murder actually took place... And now you know who was able to drop the murder weapon from above the scene! Acro! It could only have been you!
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Maya:
Acro's been playing mind games with all of us!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He sure has... But he has come to the end of his rope now.)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
So...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What now!?
</line><line>von Karma:
You've graced us with a rather long-winded tale... But do you have any evidence to prove that your fairy tale is <textEffects>true</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Judge:
... E-Evidence...?
</line><line>von Karma:
In this court, only two things matter. The power of evidence, and the power of my whip.
</line><line>Judge:
Don't forget the power of my gavel as well! Mr. Wright, the prosecution brings up a good point. Can we see some evidence?
</line><line>Maya:
Nick... They say they want evidence...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I just explained how there can only be one possible murder method. But there is still <textEffects>something unusual</textEffects> about Moe's eyewitness account.
</line><line>Maya:
"Unusual"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects>, actually.
</line><line>Maya:
OK then! Use that and get out of this jam!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough talking amongst yourselves. Proceed, Mr. Wright. Present some evidence to the court that backs your claims. I want <textEffects>hard proof</textEffects> that you have <textEffects>unraveled the trick</textEffects> to this magic case...!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The problem is <textEffects>Max's three symbols</textEffects>... You know... The silk hat, the cloak, and the white roses.
</line><line>Judge:
Those symbols were a problem numerous times during yesterday's proceedings.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yesterday, there were <textEffects>two contradictions</textEffects> in Moe's testimony.
</line><line>von Karma:
The <textEffects>silk hat</textEffects> was one. The <textEffects>white roses</textEffects> were the other.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But the theory I just presented explains all of these contradictions!
</line><line>von Karma:
You fool! Do you ever shut up!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Max's silk hat was found at the scene of the crime. However! Remember what Moe said yesterday. He testified that the criminal he saw fleeing the scene was <textEffects>wearing a silk hat</textEffects>! There's only one explanation for that! The "silk hat" that Moe saw was actually the bust!
</line><line>Judge:
Makes sense... If you look at it that way, then he did see the silk hat, well, sort of.
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
Fine, you've got one, but what about the other contradiction!?
</line><line>Judge:
The other contradiction...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Remember what that ventriloquist said in court! He said that he witnessed "<textEffects>white roses</textEffects>" on "Max's" chest that night! But the clown's testimony doesn't match! The clown said that there were <textEffects>no</textEffects> "white roses"! I'd like to see you try and explain that one away!!
</line><line>Maya:
Can you do it, Nick!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course! I can explain all of it!
</line><line>von Karma:
What was that...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please recall the instant when the cloak snagged onto the bust! If the cloak snagged onto the bust, what happened to the white roses? Do you get it yet? If the cloak got snagged onto the front of the bust... It means that the white roses would end up on the <textEffects>back of the bust</textEffects>!
</line><line>von Karma:
AHHHHH!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which explains why Moe didn't see it! The white roses were not visible because they were on the <textEffects>back side of the bust</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Orderrrrrrrr!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
... This is quite the shocking state of affairs. Mr. Wright's theory still sounds a bit absurd to me. However... Let's just keep going down this road for a while and see where it leads!
</line><line>Maya:
Let's do this, Nick! Then maybe Von Karma will finally throw in the towel...
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Maya:
Well... So much for that theory.
</line><line>Acro:
Mr. Wright... Do you mind?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it?
</line><line>Acro:
You took the time to research our circus, didn't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... Yes, I did... Is there something making you think that I didn't?
</line><line>Acro:
If you did, then maybe you'll understand why I think you're off track.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... Why is that?
</line><line>von Karma:
Motive. This witness feels an incredible debt of gratitude towards the Ringmaster. Anyone with any relation to the circus is well aware of this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>von Karma:
Thus, there is absolutely no way someone like this would kill the Ringmaster!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>von Karma:
Your Honor, I'd like you to hear Acro's story! Learn about his relationship with the Ringmaster, and his life up until now...
</line><line>Maya:
W-What do we do!? There's no doubting that Acro deeply respected the Ringmaster!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Acro's motive... Hmm...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
It seems that this case isn't over yet... Very well. However, I feel this is a good place to take a break. I will listen to the rest of Mr. Dingling's testimony after recess.
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Judge:
This court will now take a 10 minute recess.

<line>Max:
I can't believe it!! Acro!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's pretty shocking, isn't it?
</line><line>Max:
It definitely is! And to think he was always the most straight-forward of the group. Geebus... Unbelievable...
</line><line>*Ahem!*
</line><line>Maya:
Acro tried to pin the murder on you on purpose...
</line><line>Max:
He... He did?
</line><line>*Psst!* *Psst!* *Cough!*
</line><line>Max:
My my... He's just a little twerp, isn't he...?
</line><line>Maya:
Well... that's one way to put it.
</line><line>*Cough!* Hey! Hey pal!!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You're gonna ignore me after I went to all this trouble to bring you some evidence!?
</line><line>Maya:
Ahh... Detective Gumshoe...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ahh, forget it. I'm goin' home. This guy deserves to be guilty anyways...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now now Detective. I'm sorry. Now, why don't you relax a little.
</line><line>Maya:
We've got some really tasty milk!
</line><line>Max:
How about a card trick, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Ho ho ho... Well, if you insist...
</line><line>Maya:
Now about that evidence you mentioned... What is it!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Here ya go.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? This was... Yesterday in Acro's room...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
The result of our investigation... You can look at it later.
</line><line>Maya:
Won't Von Karma be mad that you're doing this?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... That's why this is all a secret.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Look, details are on a need to know basis. And we're not really allies or anything... But everything that's happened in court up until now has gone according to our plan.
</line><line>Maya:
Von Karma looked like she was in a pretty big hurry though.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You'll figure it out eventually, pal... Yesterday, our <textEffects>final plans</textEffects> were put into place.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Final plans"...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Uh huh. That reminds me... I've got a message from the prosecutor for you. "Judgment comes at the very last instant." That's it. And that's it for me too, pal. I'm goin' home.
</line><line>Maya:
What did he mean by that... "The very last instant" part.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Everything he said seemed pretty cryptic to me...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh... One more thing.
</line><line>Maya:
Ahhh! Don't scare me like that!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It looks like there's a large care package from the circus for the defendant.
</line><line>Max:
Eh? For me...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's milk. The reception area looks like some kind of dairy, so hurry up and drink it before it spoils.
</line><line>Max:
An entire dairy's worth of milk... For me!?

<line>Judge:
This court is now in session. Shall we continue our proceedings? Ms. von Karma. Please continue from where you left off.
</line><line>von Karma:
I'd like to continue with Acro's testimony, starting with his relationship to the victim. I'd also like to get proof from the defense... Proof of what kind of motive Acro would have to commit this crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Understood. Now Mr. Dingling.
</line><line>Acro:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony.
</line><line>Maya:
Finally we get to the motive! Wait... Nick, are you OK?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just do me a favor and don't ask questions you don't want the answer to...

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- About the Ringmaster --</textEffects></center>
<line>Acro:
When we were little, we were abandoned by our parents.
That's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.
I became an acrobat at around nine years old.
I wanted to find a way to repay the Ringmaster. That was my sole purpose in life...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... You're such a thoughtful young man.
</line><line>von Karma:
As you heard, the witness deeply respected the victim. I wonder how anyone could think that Acro could kill the man he held in such esteem.
</line><line>Judge:
You are absolutely right... How could anyone think that, Mr. Wright? Which is why there's no real need for a cross-examination is there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Actually, that's the question I'm trying to answer myself... "<span style="color:#E16935">Why would Acro kill the Ringmaster?</textEffects>"... This might be my last chance to answer that question.)</span>
</line>

<line>Acro:
<textEffects>That's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Acro:
<textEffects>I became an acrobat at around nine years old.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Acro:
<textEffects>I wanted to find a way to repay the Ringmaster. That was my sole purpose in life...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Maya:
What do you think, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I dunno... I think the more I cross-examine him, the worse I end up looking in the end.
</line><line>Maya:
Y-You mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I get the feeling that this cross-examination was a trap.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah... Von Karma set you up again...
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>After pressing all statements:</i>
</line><line>Judge:
I think that will be enough for now. Pondering whether or not this witness would kill the Ringmaster leads me to believe that is pretty much unlikely.
</line><line>von Karma:
Exactly right, Your Honor.
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Mr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question."

<line>Judge:
Mr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Go ahead, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
What was Acro's motive for killing the Ringmaster? How about it? Can you explain that to me?
</line>

<line>Judge:
Umm... Let me just go over this one more time... This is why Acro killed the Ringmaster?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is correct.
</line><line>von Karma:
I don't think the defense would mind confirming something for me. What exactly are we supposed to learn from this piece of evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you supposed to learn... Hmm...
</line><line>von Karma:
Looks like you just won the award for Biggest Failure in Court.
</line><line>Maya:
Ouch... Biggest Failure in Court... That stings!
</line><line>Judge:
In recognition of your honor, let me bestow you with my special prize! So now what will you do, Mr. Wright? I would prefer you hurry up and prove something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Drats! Now I'm really gonna have to think about this...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah... I didn't even have to think about it... It was obvious from the start!)</textEffects> Your Honor. The reason that Acro killed the Ringmaster is something that can't be proven.
</line><line>Judge:
W-What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's because Acro had no reason to kill the Ringmaster at all. OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Your foolish attempts to fool us like foolish fools is so fool-heartedly foolish! Did you forget!? You made an accusation against this witness, did you not? I believe it was... "This is the real killer of Russell Berry, Ringmaster."
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you want to jump to the end of things... Then, yes, that sounds about right.
</line><line>Judge:
The end of things...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro. You didn't plan to kill the Ringmaster at all, did you? The <textEffects>Ringmaster wasn't your target</textEffects> that night.
</line><line>von Karma:
What did you just say!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm saying that the target of this witness' murder plot was not the Ringmaster. <textEffects>He did not plan to kill Russell Berry</textEffects>!
</line><line>von Karma:
W-WHAAATT?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Bailiff, I don't care who it is, smack anyone who's loud in the face! Twice if you must! Mr. Wright! What in the world are you trying to do to my court!? OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright! What in the world are you trying to do this his court!? Are you attempting to imply that Acro was trying to kill someone else!?
</line>


<line>von Karma:
Regina Berry...?
</line><line>Judge:
This young girl is the Ringmaster's daughter, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro. You were really aiming for her that night, weren't you?
</line><line>Acro:

You don't need to answer that! It's a mean-spirited leading question!!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
He could easily answer this question! If I'm wrong, all he has to say is, "You're wrong." That's it.
</line><line>von Karma:
That's it, huh Mr. Phoenix Wright?
</line><line>Judge:
Enough! Mr. Wright, allow me to-- OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
The only thing allowed to interrupt me is death itself!
</line><line>Judge:
Huh!?
</line><line>von Karma:
And that goes for you too... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Show me evidence! Now! I want to know <textEffects>why</textEffects> Acro would want to kill <textEffects>Regina Berry</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Y-Yes! Me too! I demand to see some proof! Present evidence that proves Acro was out to kill this young girl!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Acro... Do you have any recollection of seeing this?
</line><line>Acro:
That's...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a piece of paper that we found inside the Ringmaster's tailcoat.
</line><line>Judge:
Inside the victim's tailcoat?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro wrote this note. It's ironically entitled "<textEffects>To the Murderer!</textEffects>"... It's<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> purpose was to call someone to the plaza at 10:00 PM.
</line><line>Judge:
So you're saying that he called Russell Berry with that note...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's just one little problem...
</line><line>Judge:
Problem?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro did indeed place this note into someone's pocket. However, that someone was not the Ringmaster!
</line><line>von Karma:
You mean... It wasn't for the...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's exactly what I mean. The person this note was intended for was none other than Regina Berry!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Wright! This little theory of yours...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's the truth, Your Honor. It isn't a theory. Simply put, Regina didn't think the note was meant for her. Which is why, the morning of the crime, she placed it on the cafeteria bulletin board.
</line><line>von Karma:
That's when her father... I mean the Ringmaster... Read the note?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's correct. The ringmaster ended up in that plaza <textEffects>instead of Regina</textEffects>! And he was killed because of that mistake... Instead of Regina!!
</line><line>Judge:
That's... That's... That's incredible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember the testimony that Acro gave us earlier today!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Acro:
Lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body. If I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Acro had no idea <textEffects>who</textEffects> it was that arrived in the plaza... Because he couldn't look down out of his window to see who it actually was.
</line><line>Judge:
I've got it! I've got it! Acro thought it was <textEffects>Regina</textEffects> down in the plaza...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's when he let the bust fly.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick... Isn't Regina listening to all of this from the audience?
</line><line>Phoenix:
She is. Unfortunately, it's only going to get harsher from here.
</line><line>Maya:
I hope Regina can handle it...
</line><line>Judge:
Acro wrote this note to Regina...!

</line><line>von Karma:
Foolishly foolish fool with foolishly foolish fool ideas of foolish tomfoolery... ... You're so foolish, you've even made me sound like a foolhardy fool... Very well, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If you're so sure, then tell us about this line! "I have <textEffects>conclusive evidence</textEffects> of what took place."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh huh. That's a line in the note alright.
</line><line>von Karma:
Well, then if the note was sent to Regina Berry, it must mean that... This note is declaring that Regina Berry is a <textEffects>murderer</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You just don't get it, do you?
</line><line>von Karma:
What!? ... What did you just say!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Ringmaster knew what the note meant! Which is why he went to the plaza. ...In place of his lovely daughter!
</line><line>Judge:
H-Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! What is this <textEffects>incident</textEffects> that is alluded to in the note?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">incident</textEffects> six months ago...)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
An incident occurred six months ago... And now I am more than ready to show this court what happened at that time!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Moron!
</line><line>Judge:
Wait! Are you sure that it relates to the present case!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It does indeed, Your Honor! Everything in this case has its start in what happened six months ago!
</line><line>Maya:
Really, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... Umm... I think so.
</line><line>von Karma:
Well then if that's the case, hurry up and tell us about it. What is this "<textEffects>conclusive evidence</textEffects>" mentioned in the note? I know I'd certainly like to know what it is!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I can't answer that question, the judge is going to think I'm bluffing!)</textEffects> The "<textEffects>conclusive evidence</textEffects>" about the incident six months ago is actually...
</line>


<line>Judge:
... Hmm... ... *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!*
</line><line>von Karma:
What kind of spicy joke is this... Mr. Phoenix Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It isn't a joke at all. It's the decisive evidence you asked for.
</line><line>Judge:
W-W-What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim would arrive and try to take away the wooden box. That's when they'd discover the <textEffects>decisive evidence</textEffects> found inside!
</line><line>Judge:
Another unbelievable conclusion! Very well, Mr. Wright. So what exactly are you saying? Are you claiming Regina Berry killed someone with <textEffects>a small bottle of pepper</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Taking the note into account, that's the only logical conclusion you can draw...
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
...Foolish fool who never tires of his own foolish ways... If you're so sure, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then answer this question! Who was Regina Berry's intended victim?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Who is this...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is Acro's younger brother.
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
What does this prove? His younger brother isn't dead!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Technically, that's true. However, Bat has been in a coma for six months now... It's not a stretch to see how Acro could feel that his brother is dead!
</line><line>Judge:
Regina... She did that to him...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Do you spend your entire life dreaming up new ways to be a fool!? Naturally, the prosecution has looked into Acro's brother, Sean Dingling. Six months ago, he was bit by a lion and fell into his current comatose state!
</line><line>Judge:
A l-l-lion!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Regina... I mean, Ms. Regina Berry is an animal tamer by trade. However, no tamed animal in that position is ever trained to attack another human! They wouldn't understand the command! Moreover, Ms. Regina could never do something like that! It's just not in her.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So then what happened to Acro's brother?
</line><line>von Karma:
He's not the victim of an <textEffects>attempted murder</textEffects>, he's the victim of an <textEffects>accident</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
I see...
</line><line>Maya:
Now what do we do? No one seems to be going along with your theory. Do you think what happened to Bat was actually an accident!?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The lion biting Bat was no accident at all!
</line><line>Judge:
W-WHAT!?
</line><line>von Karma:
You're such an amateur, Mr. Phoenix Wright! There is no way that Regina would ever incite her lion to attack another human being!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She may not have incited the lion to attack another human being, but Regina is responsible for making the lion bite Acro's brother, Bat!
</line>


<line>Judge:
That's... That's just a scarf.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acro.
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
This scarf is something that Bat used to wear, correct?
</line><line>Acro:
That's right...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And who is the one that gave this scarf to Bat?
</line><line>Acro:
R... Regina... Regina gave it to him...
</line><line>Judge:
Regina...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is something more than just blood on this scarf, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
...And what might that be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Pepper</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Pepper?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pepper. Regina gave this scarf to Bat right before the accident! And she covered it with as much pepper as she could!
</line><line>von Karma:
...
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>..................
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hey... What's with the silent treatment?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Umm... Excuse me, Mr. Wright. You've done a good job of fingering a criminal... But out of curiosity... What was her crime?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm...
</line><line>Judge:
Regina gave a pepper covered scarf to Bat as a present. Where's the crime in that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It still seems like the judge just doesn't get it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Wasn't it said that the lion seemed to be smiling?
</line><line>Acro:
!
</line><line>Judge:
Smiling? The lion was smiling?
</line><line>von Karma:
Right before Bat was bit by the lion. For a moment, the lion's mouth changed and it looked like he was... <textEffects>Smiling</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Lions... Smile?
</line><line>von Karma:
I've never heard of them smiling; however...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Lions sneeze.
</line><line>Judge:
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Léon didn't plan on biting Bat at all. ...In reality, all he actually did was sneeze. He sneezed because of all the pepper spread on the scarf!
</line><line>Judge:
W-W-W-W-WHAT!?!?
</line><line>von Karma:
YOU FOOOOOOL!!

</line><line>Judge:
W-What's the matter, Ms. von Karma?
</line><line>von Karma:
I... I... I object... For objection's sake... Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... This theory... You believe it? You really plan to say this joke of an accident actually happened?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course I do! It's the truth. The lion sneezed due to the pepper, and that's when Bat... Lost consciousness. Acro nearly lost his brother due to this accident! Or this "joke" as you put it. Which is why he tried to get his revenge... Against Regina.
</line><line>von Karma:
You foolish idiot!
</line><line>Acro:
Hmm... So it's a "joke of an accident" to you huh? ... Once again, I'm impressed by your imagination, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Acro:
To think that there's someone who treats this accident with the respect it deserves...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you telling me that what I said was... True?
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Maya:
A-Acro...
</line><line>von Karma:
...You don't mean!? You can't mean!? Witness...!?
</line><line>Judge:
A-Are you confirming the defense's claim...!?
</line><line>Acro:
... Mr. Wright. Unfortunately, your imagination is not enough to find me guilty of murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Acro:
The pepper... The scarf... The lion... ...I see where you're going, but it's a bit hard to swallow... Not to mention the fact that there's an even bigger problem with your theory.
</line><line>Judge:
What would that problem be?
</line><line>Acro:
The same problem it's always been... Evidence. If I dropped Max's bust on top of the Ringmaster... Where is the evidence that proves that claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhhh...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... You mean the "conclusive evidence"?
</line><line>von Karma:
The biggest problem is the <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>, or the lack thereof to be more precise.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Murder weapon...
</line><line>Judge:
The "<textEffects>bust</textEffects>" that the defense claims was used... If that were to be found in Acro's room, and if it was covered with the victim's blood, that would be awfully conclusive in my eyes.
</line><line>von Karma:
Yes it would be...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The "<span style="color:#E16935">bust</textEffects>"...)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! You've gotta do something...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is the <span style="color:#E16935">last step</textEffects>... If I get this one right, the case is won!)</span>
</line>


<line>von Karma:
A Von Karma never leaves anything to chance! We already searched Acro's room yesterday!
</line><line>Judge:
W-What did you find!?
</line><line>von Karma:
There's no reason to even say it. If we found what you think we found in that room, Acro would not be here as a witness. But to put a point on it, Max's bust was not in the room! The murder weapon is still unaccounted for.
</line><line>Acro:
You see, Mr. Wright. The bust wasn't in my room.
</line><line>von Karma:
Furthermore, Detective Dick Gumshoe executed the search by complete surprise. And we took Acro directly to the prosecutor's office after that. End of story...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(J-Just wait a second... Something's funny about all this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Acro:
Heh heh heh heh... It looks like the coup d'grace in this case was ever so sweet...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... But... What about the scarf!? What about the note!?
</line><line>Acro:
What about them? Mr. Wright, no offense, but the important evidence here is about the death of the Ringmaster. I think you should remember that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arrggh!
</line><line>Maya:
Do something Nick! Don't let this case slip away!! The bust... Where is it now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... Where's the <span style="color:#E16935">bust right now</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
You're Phoenix Wright! You know where that bust is! I'm sure you do!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's not even a single clue... How am I supposed to know where the bust is!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It seems as if this case is coming to a close... The defense's counter-arguments look to have fallen short.
</line><line>von Karma:
Thank you for your support...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Ack!
</line><line>Acro:
Now if you'll please excuse me, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Judge:
I think that brings to an end the cross-examination of this witness!

Where is Max's bust...? The defense needs time to prepare to present it's<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> lace... I mean case. Sorry, I'm a bit nervous and I just bit my tongue.
</line><line>Judge:
Huh?
</line><line>von Karma:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We need time to do WHAT!?!? OWWW!!
</line><line>von Karma:
Why are you the most surprised person here!? She's YOUR aide, isn't she!?
</line><line>Judge:
D-Do you really have a-a case to present, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Whaaa!? Is he talking to me!?
</line><line>Maya:
The rest is up to you, Nick! Good luck!
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-Hey... Wait... You can't be serious...
</line><line>Maya:
Acrobat's<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> always have their lives on the lines, don't they? That's how Acro's lived his life up until now. Now it's time for us to walk across our own tightrope! If we don't, we're certain to lose!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well... The defense may proceed.
</line><line>Acro:
He doesn't have a clue...  And I don't think he'll be finding one anytime soon.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step! Sink or swim... The only way through is forward!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
The murder weapon... Where is Max's bust now!?

<line>Phoenix:
Acro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?
</line><line>Acro:
... I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... You are a big guy... And you have a pretty big wheelchair because of it... I just wanted to make sure you weren't hiding anything under that blanket. Because it seems to me that it'd be really easy to say... <textEffects>Hide a bust under there</textEffects>...
</line><line>Acro:
...Hah hah hah hah hah... Once again, your penchant for humor hits me where it hurts, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think it's pretty amazing that you could laugh in your position... However, your lightheartedness doesn't change the fact that the bust is under there.
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
We all know that you couldn't leave the lodging house by yourself in your condition. That proved inconvenient when Ms. von Karma happened to <textEffects>search your room</textEffects> yesterday. If she had found the murder weapon in your room, it would have been all over. Which is why you had to hide it. In the only place that you could hide it... Under your wheelchair.
</line><line>Acro:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which is why, Acro, I have to ask you again. Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?
</line><line>Acro:
... Well done, Mr. Wright. Masterfully played.
</line><line>von Karma:
...You!! You fool! How could you...!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Acro:
You've got me. I've been bagged by a real pro. Actually, two of them...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Two of them</textEffects>...?)</span>
</line><line>Acro:
Ms. Franziska von Karma and Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>von Karma:
...What!?
</line><line>Acro:
There's just one think I'd like to know... How did you know to launch the surprise search on my room last night?
</line><line>von Karma:
...?
</line><line>Acro:
There were two decisive pieces of evidence... The cloak and the bust... I burned the cloak in my room and threw the ashes away with the trash. ...Regina always took my trash out every morning, you know. But the bust... Obviously I couldn't throw that away. When you executed your search, all I could do was try and hide the bust. And the only place that I could hide it quickly was under this wheelchair... Ms. von Karma, you had things all figured out, didn't you? I was completely sucked in by your calculated strategy... And now to be caught in the middle of court hiding the murder weapon... ...There's no way I can escape that. So you've got me. Well done, Mr. Wright. Well done, Ms. von Karma.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It all makes sense now.
</line><line>Maya:
I can't believe that Von Karma thought that far ahead... It's amazing!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh huh... You definitely couldn't tell by looking at her. I know I sure couldn't.
</line><line>von Karma:
...I can't believe it... I... Failed! Why did I order a surprise search of your room...? If only I hadn't done that...
</line><line>Judge:
It doesn't matter now though. It seems as if we've arrived at the truth. Acro.
</line><line>Acro:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Did you kill the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Mr. Russell Berry?
</line><line>Acro:
Yes, Your Honor. I'm responsible for that crime.
</line><line>Maya:
Acro...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Acro:
... All my brother did... was want Regina to like him. That's why he'd tease her. One day, my brother sprinkled some pepper on Regina. She started sneezing so hard... You couldn't help yourself from laughing. That's why Regina thought it'd be funny to <textEffects>get him back</textEffects> in the same way...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's why she covered the scarf in pepper...
</line><line>Acro:
I know she didn't want anything bad to happen... I know this... She just wanted to make my brother sneeze a few times too... But... I just couldn't forgive her! No matter what. What am I truly guilty of? ...I'm guilty of never, ever being able to understand her. "Your brother became a star." Regina believed in that so purely, that she would laugh innocently when saying it... Too innocently... I just couldn't stand it... No matter how hard I tried.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's when you decided to do something about Regina...
</line><line>von Karma:
What do you mean by that...?
</line><line>Judge:
So are you saying that you are a victim in all of this as well?
</line><line>Acro:
No... That's not what I mean. I'm nothing but a murderer. That's who I am... At first, I thought I'd kill myself. Then I pondered giving myself up... But... I couldn't just up and leave... I just couldn't... That's why... I tried... to pin this... on Max. Max... I'm so sorry...! I just... I just... I couldn't just up and leave yet...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
This has been such a strange case... It's almost a reflection of the circus itself.
</line><line>von Karma:
I'm... An... Idiot... I can't believe it... You... Beat me... Again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
I believe this case is now beyond any point of possible discussion. Thus, I'd like to declare my verdict.
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>

This court is adjourned.

<line>Max:
F-F-F-FABULOUS!! But to be honest, I can't really be too happy about this.
</line><line>Maya:
Acro, the Ringmaster, Regina, and Bat... Not a single one of them was a bad person inside, huh?
</line><line>Max:
That's a good question. And one I don't know the answer to.
</line><line>Moe:
Congratulations! Congratulations Mr. Max!
</line><line>Max:
T-Thank you. ...
</line><line>Maya:
...
</line><line>Moe:
What's with the vibe in this room?
</line><line>Maya:
We were just thinking about Acro...
</line><line>Moe:
No no no no no! If you worry about people too much, then you'll be like this forever, and never be happy!
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Regina:
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!
</line><line>Moe:
...She's been like this for a while now.
</line><line>Regina:
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! IT'S ALL MY FAULTTTTTT!! WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!
</line><line>Max:
S-S-Sweetie... Sweetie pie...
</line><line>Regina:
Bat and Acro... They're never coming back!! Now... Now everyone's gonna split up!!
</line><line>Maya:
Regina...
</line><line>Regina:
Mr. Wright! Tell me something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-What do you want to know, Regina?
</line><line>Regina:
Acro said something right at the end...
</line>
<hr />
<line>...I just couldn't up and leave yet...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Regina:
...Does that mean Acro... Is he gonna try and get his revenge on me!?

<line>Moe:
Hey, Max.
</line><line>Max:
What is it, Moe?
</line><line>Moe:
We really put you through a lot, didn't we buddy? I'm sorry about what happened. So whenever you'd like to leave us, I'll pay your fee and rip up the contract.
</line><line>Max:
I understand! Such a fabulous thing to do for me... I might even leave tomorrow. ... What's going to happen to the circus now?
</line><line>Moe:
Ahh... That's the big question. Our Ringmaster was really an amazing person, wasn't he?
</line><line>Max:
...?
</line><line>Moe:
Even though he's not here anymore, everyone is sticking together. The staff, the performers... No one wants to leave the circus. That's why I've made a decision...
</line><line>Max:
What is it?
</line><line>Moe:
I've decided that I will take over as the new Ringmaster. I'll turn this circus into the best circus this world has ever seen!
</line><line>Max:
... The best circus the world has ever seen!?
</line><line>Moe:
D-D-Don't laugh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Amazing...
</line><line>Maya:
Yay! I can't wait!!
</line><line>Max:
Then I guess that changes things...
</line><line>Moe:
Huh?
</line><line>Max:
There's only one thing the best circus in the world has ever seen needs. The world's best illusions... Which means this circus needs the best magician the world has ever seen!
</line><line>Moe:
Max...
</line><line>Max:
Let's work together and make our circus SUPER FABULOUS! Whaddya say big guy?
</line><line>Moe:
I don't know what to say... All I can say is thank you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... Regina, you're gonna help them out too, aren't you?
</line><line>Regina:
Umm... I don't know. Maybe the circus would be better of<textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> without me.
</line><line>Moe:
What are you talking about, Regina? Why do you think that I brought you to court today?
</line><line>Regina:
Uhh...
</line><line>Moe:
We've got to work together to make the Berry Big Circus bigger than it's ever been!
</line><line>Regina:
M-Moe...
</line><line>Max:
Moe's right, sweetie pie! It can't be the Berry Big Circus without Regina Berry!
</line><line>Regina:
M-Max...
</line><line>Maya:
Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It seems like everything is going to turn out alright here...
</line><line>Maya:
I can't wait to go see the best circus the world has ever seen!
</line><line>Max:
We'll save you the most fabulous seats!
</line><line>Moe:
It'll take us a while to get ready, but I'm going to order special whoopee cushion seats! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
</line>
<hr />
<line>I see... What made the case?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Just like you thought... <span style="color:#E16935">Yesterday's search</textEffects> really paid off, sir! Umm... You had it all figured out yesterday, didn't you?</span>
</line><line>It was just a theory... If Acro really was the killer, I thought this was the only way it could end. Especially if "he" was the defense attorney...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>You mean <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Wright</textEffects>?</span>
</line><line>Of course... Well Detective, my plane is about to leave. Do me a favor and try not to be too harsh on Acro. Once I get back, I'll make a stop by the Chief Prosecutor's office.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Yes, sir! I'll be waiting for you! Goodbye Mr. Edgeworth!</textEffects>
