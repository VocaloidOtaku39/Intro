</line><line>Phoenix:
You received a call from a "man"?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Er... yup.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
That woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Different people?
</line><line>Karma:
There were two witnesses!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Urk!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
What happened next, Detective?

<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.</textEffects>
</line>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Maya:
Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.
</line><line>Maya:
What do we do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?
</line><line>Maya:
Well said, Nick! You're the man!
</line>
<hr />
<line>(<i>Pressing fifth statement and sixth twice leads to:</i>)
</line><line>Karma:
Members of the court... We now have <textEffects>the pistol</textEffects> used in the murder, and <textEffects>the bullet</textEffects> found in the body! Detective!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-y-yessir!
</line><line>Karma:
Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?
</line><line>Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!
</line><line>Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.
</line><line>Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "<textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects>" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "<textEffects>ballistic fingerprints</textEffects>" to see <textEffects>which gun fired the shot</textEffects>. It's quite accurate.
</line><line>Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!
</line><line>Judge:
O-order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Well, Judge?
</line><line>Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...
</line><line>Karma:
You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-yes?
</line><line>Karma:
What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but, wait, I...
</line><line>Karma:
Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who's running this court, anyway!?)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uh... hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
True...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Was that you in the boat?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Yes. It was me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-then who did!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... don't know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-you mean it was a suicide!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... That's the only explanation I can come up with.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh... <textEffects>(How am I going to convince anyone of that!?)</textEffects> Say, Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? Wh-what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Any progress with Mia?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh... Sorry. It's no good.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh...
</line><line>Maya:
I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?
</line>


<line>Maya:
I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!
</line><line>Maya:
Really...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? Oh! S-sorry... <textEffects>(Whoops!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.
</line><line>Karma:
Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Karma:
Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?
</line><line>Lotta:
That I am.
</line><line>Karma:
Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?
</line><line>Lotta:
... Y'all need to learn some manners.
</line><line>Karma:
UNDERSTAND?
</line><line>Lotta:
Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!
</line><line>Judge:
Er... very well. Your testimony, please.
</line>

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Witness's Account --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Karma:
Enough.
</line><line>Lotta:
Huh?
</line><line>Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!
</line><line>Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!
</line><line>Karma:
... Well, Judge?
</line><line>Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!
</line><line>Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in <textEffects>contempt of court</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Contempt of court," you know?
</line><line>Maya:
I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!
</line><line>Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Very well!
</line><line>Judge:
I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.

</line><line>Judge:
Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but, Your Honor!
</line><line>Karma:
You keep your promise!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in <textEffects>contempt of court</textEffects>!
</line><line>Karma:
And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... uh huh.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.
</line><line>Karma:
Then, pass your judgment!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.

I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?
</line><line>Maya:
No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!
</line><line>Lotta:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?
</line><line>Judge:
You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!

Answer me, Lotta!

Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in <textEffects>contempt of court</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No... No...!)</textEffects>
</line>
<center>Wait!</center>
<line>Maya:
I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!
</line><line>Karma:
Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Karma:
You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!
</line><line>Judge:
... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.
</line><line>Karma:
What!?
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.
</line><line>Karma:
B-but he is in contempt of court!
</line><line>Maya:
No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.

Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!

Look at this photograph.
</line><line>Lotta:
The photo I took...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.
</line><line>Lotta:
So... so?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?

Whut!? Wha--!

Mr. Wright has a point!

</line><line>Karma:
That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Hart.
</line><line>Lotta:
What!
</line><line>Judge:
Could you see the defendant that night?
</line><line>Lotta:
O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!

Still, I brought my binoculars with me.
When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.
See? No problem!

Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?

...!

W-well then, what exactly was she photographing?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!
</line><line>Judge:
What's this? A newspaper article? "<textEffects>Gourdy</textEffects>"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Hart?
</line><line>Lotta:
I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this "Gourdy."
</line>


<line>Judge:
Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!
</line>



<line>Judge:
Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, sure!)</textEffects> Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a <textEffects>photo of Gourdy</textEffects>, weren't you?
</line><line>Lotta:
... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Lotta:
That don't change what I saw, does it?
</line><line>Karma:
Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!

H-hey!

But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!

<textEffects>(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.
</line><line>Lotta:
... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- Lotta's New Testimony --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lotta:
Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.
I'm an investigative photographer.
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
That's why I was camping out by the lake.
But, that's all I was hiding.
When I heard the "<textEffects>bang</textEffects>" I looked right straight out at that lake.
There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.
Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.
I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.

<line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.

The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!

</line><line>Phoenix:
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! <textEffects>(von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.
</line><line>Karma:
Hah! That would be a first!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hah hah, very funny.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You understand that this is your <textEffects>last chance</textEffects> at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

<center><textEffects>-- Lotta's New Testimony --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>I'm an investigative photographer.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>That's why I was camping out by the lake.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>But, that's all I was hiding.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lotta:
<textEffects>Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?
</line><line>Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!
</line><line>Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a <textEffects>loud noise</textEffects>? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of <textEffects>Gourdy</textEffects>, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!
</line><line>Lotta:
Aah!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through <textEffects>binoculars</textEffects>! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for <textEffects>Gourdy</textEffects>... and that's what you were doing!
</line><line>Lotta:
...! ... ...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well!?
</line><line>Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...
</line><line>Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?
</line><line>Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.
</line><line>Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--
</line><line>Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.
</line><line>Lotta:
Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.
</line><line>Lotta:
Sh-shut my what!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to <textEffects>enlarge</textEffects> the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?
</line><line>Lotta:
Y-yeah! I did!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?
</line><line>Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Karma:
B-because it does not exist!
</line><line>Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!
</line><line>Judge:
What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!
</line><line>Karma:
Er... erm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!
</line><line>Karma:

</line><line>Karma:
The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.
</line><line>Lotta:
Here it is.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Lake Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
Happy now, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... <textEffects>(There has to be something!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Karma:
You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...
</line><line>Karma:
Is over! Obviously!
</line><line>Judge:
Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
</line><line>Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
</line><line>Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
</line><line>Judge:
Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!
</line><line>Judge:
W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is "strange"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look at <textEffects>the hand holding the pistol</textEffects>, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>The hand</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
This man's left hand does what...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in <textEffects>his left hand</textEffects>. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "<textEffects>right hand</textEffects>"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?
</line><line>Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... <textEffects>the victim himself</textEffects>!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed <textEffects>suicide</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.
</line><line>Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
</line><line>Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals <textEffects>the distance</textEffects> at which he was shot.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The... distance?
</line><line>Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than <textEffects>a meter</textEffects> away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>A meter</textEffects>! Th-that's three feet!
</line><line>Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?
</line><line>Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.
</line><line><textEffects>Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
</line><line>Karma:
...
</line><line>Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned.

Whew, that was a close one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.
