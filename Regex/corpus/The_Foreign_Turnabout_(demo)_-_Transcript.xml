<title>The Foreign Turnabout (demo)</title>

<line>
Here in Khura'in, death is not the end. Even after death, the soul lives on in the Twilight Realm... and priestesses can commune with the spirits of the dead. Fear not death. In the name of the Holy Mother... fear only impurities of your soul.
</line><line>???:
This blight on my soul... I'll have the child take the blame...

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(My name is Phoenix Wright, and I run a small law office. Well, that's what I do back home, anyway. Right now, I'm just a traveler; a stranger in a strange land. This is the <span style="color:#E16935">Kingdom of Khura'in</textEffects> -- a land of spirit mediums and mystery. I was going to take it easy, maybe take in a few sights, until... my cheery guide, <textEffects>Ahlbi Ur'gaid</textEffects>... was suddenly arrested for murder. I couldn't just leave him to his fate... so I took up his defense. Little did I know <textEffects>just how foreign</textEffects> this country's court system would be. Talk about culture shock...)</span>

<line>Judge:
O foreign lawyer... Let me make this crystal clear to you. We have no need for defense attorneys here in the Kingdom of Khura'in. All of our verdicts are guided by our royal priestess, Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa. Her <textEffects>Divination Séances</textEffects> determine all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But I can't just let a verdict be handed down with nobody standing in Ahlbi's corner!)</textEffects> If Ahlbi doesn't have a defense attorney, then I'll do it -- I'll be his attorney!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. It is a little unorthodox, but I will allow it. Though I hope you are prepared for the consequences as well.
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh heh. Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think you would dare go against Her Benevolence and me, Gaspen Payne -- I see you are as foolhardy as ever. Hee hee hee hee hee. No matter. You will learn the hard way what it means to defend someone in this country.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Uh... Have we met before...? Or are you confusing me with someone else? ...Not that now's the time for that. I gotta say, it sounds like one tough crowd out there...)</textEffects>
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Gallery:
Just you watch! That defense attorney will try and twist the truth! You can bet on it! Get him, Prosecutor Payne! Crush that defense devil!</captions>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why in the world do they hate lawyers so much here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now, if you would please give your opening argument once again, Mr. Payne.
</line><line>Payne:
Certainly, Your Magistry. The accused is charged with two crimes: <textEffects>larceny</textEffects>... and <textEffects>murder</textEffects>. Yesterday, the national treasure known as the <textEffects>Founder's Orb</textEffects>... was stolen from the treasure room of Tehm'pul Temple. But that's not all. Along with the empty <textEffects>treasure box</textEffects>... was the <textEffects>dead body</textEffects> of Mr. Paht Rohl, a temple security guard. We believe he was murdered by the thief who stole the treasure. Please allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report and crime photo.
</line><line><textEffects>Rohl's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I should be able to check out the evidence by looking in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</textEffects> (R). I'd better take a good look at it all later.)</span> And what was the weapon used in this heinous act, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
The victim was bludgeoned to death with the <textEffects>treasure box</textEffects> itself. As you can see here, it's covered in blood. Since you seem to be shamelessly uninformed, allow me to share this newspaper article.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! That's the article containing the only public photos of the box in existence.
</line><line>Payne:
Indeed. It's forbidden for anyone outside of the royal family to view the treasure itself. Which is what makes these photos so special.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess there are national treasures that are off-limits to the public back home, too.)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Treasure Box added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Your Magistry, the prosecution would like to call the accused as our first witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Accused, you will take the stand.
</line><line>Payne:
Accused, state your name and occupation again, if you would.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Ahlbi Ur'gaid, sir.. I'm in training to be a monk... and I'm a tour guide, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry, Ahlbi. I'm here to defend you.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Mr. Wright... I didn't know you were a lawyer... You... You tricked me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
If I knew you were a lawyer, I wouldn't have given you that tour!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-Ahlbi, what's gotten into you?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Don't talk to me! You... You disgust me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now even Ahlbi's against me? What's going on here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Heh heh heh. This must be a new experience for you, Mr. Wright, being loathed by a client. Now, then, accused, please give this court your testimony. I want you to tell us what you were doing at the time of the crime.

I didn't kill Mr. Rohl, and I didn't steal the treasure.
I'm not allowed to go anywhere near the treasure room.
I've never even seen that treasure box with the green Khura'inese butterfly on it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Payne:
The incident occurred after the <textEffects>Dance of Devotion</textEffects> rite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>Dance of Devotion</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Judge:
You mean you don't know?! The Dance of Devotion that is performed by Her Benevolence to the <textEffects>Song of Ceremony</textEffects>... It's only the must-see of any Khura'inese tour!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>(That sour-faced girl from earlier? ...I can't see her dancing to ANYTHING, to be honest.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You disappoint me, defense. I expect you to study and memorize this lyrics sheet posthaste!
</line><line><textEffects>Song of Ceremony lyrics received at gavel-point.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, your cross-examination, please.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"<textEffects>(Finally, something familiar in this foreign court. Hmm, should I refresh my memory on how cross-examinations work...?)</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, Ahlbi... Why would you lie to me...?)</textEffects> So, you say you've never laid eyes on the treasure box. Is that right?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
That's right. It's forbidden, so I'd never do that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In that case... how did you know there was a <textEffects>green butterfly</textEffects> on it?
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Oof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait, did that bag just move on its own...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ahlbi:
I-I... I saw the picture of it... in that newspaper article.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nope. Take another look. These photos are in <textEffects>black and white</textEffects>. You couldn't possibly tell what color the butterfly is from these pictures!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
Nngh... Ooh... Aaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What the--?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
P-P-Pohlkunka! What is going on here?!
</line><line>Shah'do:
Rrr... Ruff, ruff! Ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Ahlbi:
I-I'm sorry about this. This is my dog, <textEffects>Shah'do</textEffects>.
</line><line>Shah'do:
Ruff, ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that's what was making his bag move...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
O Holy Mother. I thought my heart was about to stop for a second there. Oh, and for our foreign lawyer, "pohlkunka" is what we say when we're surprised.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I see... <textEffects>(Well, that was rather surprising. I can't believe he explained that word to me. Is His Magistry secretly a language nerd...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Still, if what you've discovered through your cross-examination is correct... then the accused has seen the murder weapon in person before. Which just makes him more suspicious than ever!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Which just makes things worse than ever...)</textEffects> Ahlbi. Please give only true statements. I can't help you if you don't tell the truth.
</line><line>Ahlbi:
............
</line><line>Shah'do:
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Darn. I just can't seem to get him to open up to me. What in the world happened in this country... to make even a kid like Ahlbi hate lawyers so much?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
As I suspected, this "cross-examination" session has served no purpose whatsoever. But armed as we are with Her Benevolence's Insight... there's no reason to doubt his guilt.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait just one moment, Your Magistry! I haven't seen this <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> for myself yet. As the defense, I have the right to check it!
</line><line>Judge:
......Hmm... Very well. We will ask to have Her Benevolence perform the Divination Séance again. But, then, right after your tearful begs for mercy, I really do have to be going.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The only "tearful begs" are going to come from the prosecution when we're through!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There she is: "Her Benevolence"...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
......Barb-headed attorney!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Rayfa:
I am told you question the veracity of the sacred Divination Séance. Rest assured, you will soon see the error of your foolish ways!
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Your Benevolence. The <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects>, if you would.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Certainly. Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their <textEffects>final memories</textEffects> in the <textEffects>Pool of Souls</textEffects>!

</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What just happened?! An image appeared in the pool!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
A final message from the victim's soul, the last communication of his mitamah... The Divination Séance has revealed this to us.
</line><line>Payne:
Her Benevolence can use her power of Spirit Communion... to project a victim's memories of <textEffects>the last few moments before their demise.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So what we saw in the pool is what Mr. Rohl actually experienced?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
In the victim's memories, we see the accused raising a weapon up over his head. This is consistent with the findings of the police investigation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This looks bad for Ahlbi... Really, really bad...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
You'll have plenty of time to regret your folly in the Twilight Realm. The souls of the departed speak only the truth, and I but give their messages a voice. If you think my Insights contain falsehood, I challenge you to prove it!

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Insight</textEffects></captions>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Rayfa's Insight --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Rayfa:
The accused swung whatever he was holding down on the victim's head!
With the pain, the victim's vision went dark. This is when he lost his life.
Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
These are the victim's experiences just before his death.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(As the victim's final memories, we can assume they aren't lies. So how do I break this down?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Allow me to relieve you of your ignorance, defense. Did you notice the <textEffects>words</textEffects> that appeared in the Séance vision?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, I did see words... like "<span style="color:#E16935">Song of Ceremony</textEffects>" and "<textEffects>Incense</textEffects>.")</span>
</line><line>Rayfa:
The victim's final memories are not limited to sight alone. Sight, smell, taste, sound, touch -- all is laid bare in the Pool of Souls.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So <textEffects>what Mr. Rohl experienced with his five senses</textEffects> appears in the vision as words, right?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Precisely. And by examining these <textEffects>sensations</textEffects>... we can perceive the victim's final moments with unparalleled clarity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Okay, so this vision shows what the victim was experiencing with his five senses... Wait a minute. Just before... Her Benevolence said "after the morning Dance of Devotion," didn't she? Isn't there something off about that?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'll use these arrows (D-Pad or Circle Pad) to select the <span style="color:#E16935">Insight</textEffects> I think is off.</span>
</line><line>Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yes, this is the <span style="color:#E16935">Insight</textEffects> that sounded funny. Now I'll just carefully compare this Insight with the Séance vision. If I notice a sensation that seems contradictory, I'll tap "<textEffects>Select</textEffects>" (X)!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is it -- this is the part of the vision that contradicts the Insight. Now I just select the sensation I think is inconsistent and then "<span style="color:#E16935">Present</textEffects>" (X) it!)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Wait just a moment!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Yes? What is it, Barbed Head?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're saying the incident occurred AFTER the morning Dance of Devotion, right?
</line><line>Rayfa:
That is right. What of it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then isn't it strange that Mr. Rohl could still hear the Song of Ceremony?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! You're absolutely right!
</line><line>Rayfa:

</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. Is that all that troubles you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Rayfa:
What the victim heard was just a practice run of the Song of Ceremony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Practice run? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Mr. Payne, if you would?
</line><line>Payne:
Certainly! The incident occurred in the interval between the morning performance... during which time, the song's singers were practicing in the performance hall.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Precisely! I was there as well, so I can corroborate this statement.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. So what the victim hears was that practice session.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ugh. There goes my contradiction...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
A most exquisite rebuttal, Your Benevolence. Now, if you wouldn't mind, could you please revise your Insight for us?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Very well.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Insight Revised</captions>
<line><s>Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?</s>
The Song of Ceremony the victim heard was of a practice run.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I think I'm getting the hang of this. If I point out an inconsistency, she'll update her Insights accordingly. So if I keep pointing things out, maybe I can knock all of her Insights out after all! I'd better find another inconsistency, no matter how small!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm... It's a bit hard to focus on the <span style="color:#E16935">Insights</textEffects> with the Séance vision going. I'll try using the "<textEffects>Pause</textEffects>" button (L) to temporarily stop the vision. There! I paused the vision! I think I can touch the flashing panels (Y/A) to jump to different parts of the vision. I'll try moving the mitamah mark to the flashing red panel there. Okay, now that I know how to get around in Séance visions... it's time to find inconsistencies between the Insight and the vision!)</span>

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You're saying the victim's field of vision went dark right after he was struck, correct?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Of course, as anyone with eyes can see.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, pardon me, but... I must disagree.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, please take another look at the exact moment the victim felt pain.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hm...? ......Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Everything goes black and then -- only <textEffects>after</textEffects> that -- the victim feels pain.
</line><line>Rayfa:
I-Inconceivable!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This places the order of events at odds with what you say happened!
</line><line>Rayfa:
P-P-P... Pohlkunka!
</line><line>Judge:
Your Benevolence! What is the meaning of this?
</line><line>Rayfa:
I c-cannot be wrong! My Insights are beyond fallacy!
</line><line>Judge:
If what the defense says is true, this is a very grave matter indeed! I'm afraid this contradiction... is something we simply can't ignore!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(All right! I crushed that Insight! Even if I have to fight every person in this country... I swear I'll get Ahlbi acquitted of this crime... in the main game!)</textEffects>
