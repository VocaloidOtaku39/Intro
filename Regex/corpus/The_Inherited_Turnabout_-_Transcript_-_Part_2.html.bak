<textEffects>(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet... They were probably used as Mr. Dover's "signature". Just as an artist would sign their name on their works.
</line><line>Kate:
R-Right...
</line><line>Delicia:
Oi! I remember now! ...Icy's sherbet sculptures had <textEffects>PH</textEffects> carved into them, I'm sure of it!
</line><line>Badd:
...<textEffects>PH</textEffects>...? Those aren't Isaac Dover's initials though...
</line><line>Gregory:
No. ...But, we found this <textEffects>seal</textEffects> at the scene of the crime. It had probably fallen out of the late Mr. Dover's pocket. If you had pressed this seal into something, it would mark the letters <textEffects>PH</textEffects>. Also... the very same <textEffects>PH</textEffects> symbol is engraved into this teapot.
</line><line>Badd:
...The same... symbol...?
</line><line>Gregory:
This teapot was made by the sculptor Pierre Hoquet. In other words... this <textEffects>PH</textEffects> is the signature of Pierre Hoquet. Ms. Hall, you know about this signature all too well, don't you?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... Monsieur Hoquet's works always bear that signature. Since he never shows himself in public, his signature is used to identify his works.
</line><line>Badd:
! No way... Are you saying Pierre Hoquet is...!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(It seems Detective Badd has also realized Isaac Dover's true identity...)</textEffects> To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef. That's because, his true identity was...!
</line>



<line>Gregory:
That's right... Mr. Dover's true identity was the sculptor Pierre Hoquet!
</line><line>Ray:
Whaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Dover was... a sculptor!?
</line><line>Badd:
Things like signatures... can be faked... if you have the original designs... Can you really use that... as proof that he was a sculptor...?
</line><line>Gregory:
No. But what's important here is that Ms. Hall thought he was. As for proving his real identity, I'll leave that to the police.
</line><line>Badd:
Hmph... I get it. ...I'll have the boys check up on it.
</line><line>Kate:
As I expected from you... Gregory Edgeworth.
</line><line>Gregory:
You... You knew Mr. Dover's real identity all along, didn't you?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... When I discovered the body, I noticed the seal... I knew from that moment he was Pierre Hoquet, the man I greatly admired. Thinking that this would be his final posthumous work, I just couldn't sit still...!
</line><line>Gregory:
So... that's why you entered Dover's room?
</line><line>Kate:
...Huh? Wh-What did you say?
</line><line>Gregory:
When exactly... did you take this photo of Dover's room?
</line><line>Kate:
Th-That was... Perhaps this was taken during the judging...
</line><line>Gregory:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Gregory:
That's strange. I thought you said the camera ran out of film during the judging. Before Mr. Master entered Dover's room, you were the one in possession of the camera. Wasn't that why you were able to take the photo when you discovered the body?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... That's right.
</line><line>Gregory:
The only photos you took with the new film were of Dover's room and the body. ...If that's the case, a new contradiction comes to light.
</line><line>Kate:
Ugh... Another one...!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Kate:
That is... my instant camera...
</line><line>Gregory:
You've already handed the photos of Dover's room and the body to myself and the police.
</line><line>Ray:
That reminds me, didn't you also take a photo of me and Mr. Edgeworth just now?
</line><line>Gregory:
The film used in this camera can take up to 20 photos. However... this camera only has <textEffects>three</textEffects> photos left. ...Which leaves 14 photos unaccounted for. Exactly what were they used to photograph?
</line><line>Kate:
...Ughh.
</line><line>Gregory:
Please show us ALL the photos you took. We will be able to discern your actions from these photos.
</line><line>Kate:
...I'm so sorry... I have told... a terrible lie.
</line><line>Badd:
Don't tell me... All of the remaining shots... are of Isaac Dover's room...
</line><line>Kate:
My deepest apologies...
</line><line>Ray:
It seems they are all shots of the ice sculptures from various angles.
</line><line>Badd:
So when these were taken... the sculptures had not melted yet. But that means... the one who caused them to melt was you...?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... I am positive... that I melted them.
</line><line>Gregory:
You are "positive"...?
</line><line>Kate:
I am an aficionado of the sculptor Pierre Hoquet, who is actually Monsieur Dover. Before the authorities could defile his final masterpieces during their investigation... I thought I should preserve them through photographs. Hence, I entered his room...
</line><line>Badd:
In that case... why did all the ice melt...?
</line><line>Kate:
...It's probably... because... As I was taking the pictures, I became entranced with his works... ...and it seems that my foot accidentally got caught in the power cord, unplugging it...
</line><line>Gregory:
Accidentally, you say?
</line><line>Kate:
I did not notice the power cord at the time... I would never have imagined that I would be the cause of those sculptures melting.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Could the truth really be that simple? However, I cannot say with certainly that she is lying...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
I am so sorry to have caused you all so much trouble...!
</line><line>Gregory:
As long as you are telling the truth, there's no need to apologize.
</line><line>Ray:
That's right! Don't sweat it, Kate!
</line><line>Kate:
...Thank you very much.
</line><line>Badd:
...Edgeworth. Here... take this picture. ...Do what you want with it.

</line><line>von Karma:
...You meddling fools still haven't given up yet, have you? No matter how long you wait, I have no intention of allowing a defense attorney to investigate.
</line><line>Gregory:
...No matter. If we can't investigate, we'll find the truth through some other method.
</line><line>von Karma:
...Always ready with a comeback. Well, do try your best.
</line><line>Kate:
Um, excuse me... Monsieur von Karma? The truth is... it was I who melted the ice sculptures in Monsieur Dover's room!
</line><line>von Karma:
What...? What's the meaning of this, you clod!?
</line><line>Kate:
I am truly sorry! Both to you and Monsieur Gustavia...!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... Do not be concerned about me. Sir von Karma has already recognized that I had no hand in this act.
</line><line>Gregory:
That reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Ah. Well, that was because...
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
Silence, ignoramus! You are not to give that attorney the tiniest hint of information. Katherine Hall! You are coming with me! You are under suspicion of being "<textEffects>complicit</textEffects>" in the murder.
</line><line>Gregory:
...!
</line><line>Kate:
N-No!
</line><line>von Karma:
I shall be interrogating you personally. ...You best prepare yourself.
</line><line>Kate:
...Very well.
</line><line>Gregory:
Please wait. I still have some questions I want to ask her...!
</line><line>von Karma:
I do not care for your sorry plight in the least.
</line><line>Gregory:
Urgh...!
</line><line>von Karma:
Badd, Gustavia, and while I'm at it, you as well, Scones. I have plenty of questions for you all.
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Understood.
</line><line>Delicia:
Fie! "While I'm at it", he says... The nerve!
</line><line>Ray:
...He just took everyone away with him.
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes... Even if we stay here, I don't think we'll be able to investigate any further today. Let's take our leave for now. It has already grown rather late. <textEffects>(I hope the snow has stopped by now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Sounds good! ...I'm starving anyway.
</line><line>Gregory:
Hmm... Let's stop somewhere for hamburgers then. <textEffects>(Before my stomach joins the chorus...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
He he he! You can't fight on an empty stomach after all!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(We'll need to report back to Mr. Master with our findings first thing tomorrow...)</textEffects>

<line>Ray:
Huh? What are you doing here, Kate?
</line><line>Kate:
Ah... Monsieur Shields and Monsieur Edgeworth. Allow me to apologize once again for all the trouble I caused you yesterday.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Ms. Hall looks a bit tired...)</textEffects> Has Von Karma finished interrogating you?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes, aside from what happened to the ice sculptures, I was not at fault for anything else.
</line><line>Ray:
Are you also here to meet with Master Jeff, Kate?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... I am worried about how he is holding up...
</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd...? Why are you here?
</line><line>Badd:
I just happened to be here... ...I'll be heading to the crime scene soon.
</line><line>Ray:
I don't think this is a place that people "happen to be" though...
</line><line>Master:
...Hello...
</line><line>Gregory:
...!
</line><line>Ray:
M-Master Jeff! What happened to you!?
</line><line>Kate:
Oh, no! Monsieur Master! Why do you look so poor!?
</line><line>Master:
...I didn't get much sleep last night... The tribulation known as questioning... was rather harsh. I'm just... a little exhausted.
</line><line>Gregory:
! ...They didn't let you sleep?
</line><line>Ray:
Even for an interrogation, that's going too far! Detective Badd!
</line><line>Badd:
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also in charge of the interrogation... I don't like Von Karma's methods, but... this was all I could do.
</line><line>Master:
He was the one who brought me here. It seems... I was supposed to be interrogated for a little bit longer, though...
</line><line>Badd:
...Hmph.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(It seems that Detective Badd is looking out for Mr. Master in his own way...)</textEffects> So, shall we inform Mr. Master about what happened yesterday, Raymond?
</line><line>Ray:
Yessir! I got all my memos right here!
</line><line>Gregory:
Mr. Master, we would like to inform you about yesterday's investigation...
</line><line>Master:
Yes... Thank you very much... Please go ahead...
</line><line>Ray:
Master Jeff. It's almost like your spirit's gone...
</line><line>Master:
Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Master...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)</textEffects>

<line>Master:
Ohh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?
</line><line>Kate:
Ah... Those chocolates are...
</line><line>Gregory:
If possible, I would like to give them to you immediately... ...but it's against the rules to give anything to the suspects in the detention center.
</line><line>Master:
I... see... Regrettably, if those are the rules, then there's nothing we can do about it...
</line><line>Badd:
.....
</line><line>Ray:
Are you sure there's no way we can give them to him...?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Detective Badd... looks like he noticed what we're trying to ask of him.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Badd:
...Tsk. ...I'll inspect the chocolates, and if there are no problems... I'll think about it.
</line><line>Gregory:
! Detective Badd... Thank you very much.
</line><line>Ray:
Alright! I knew we could count on you, Detective Badd!
</line><line>Master:
...! I am truly in your debt.
</line><line>Badd:
...Wait right here. ...Take it.
</line><line>Master:
Thank you very much...!
</line><line>Badd:
Not a word... to anyone else. ...It would cause problems for me later...
</line><line>Master:
Yes, of course... I apologize for making you go through so much trouble. Now, I shall partake in eating these delicious delights at once.
</line><line>Gregory:
I'm sorry for asking you to do something so dangerous, Detective Badd.
</line><line>Badd:
Hmph. I only did... what I wanted to do...
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. Why can't you just be honest here, Detective?
</line><line>Master:
Ohhh... How sweet! It's like I've come back to life...! Ho ho... Did Kate make these chocolates?
</line><line>Kate:
Y-Yes, sir, I did. How does it taste...?
</line><line>Master:
♬ Meeeelts... in your mouth Nooot iiin youuur haand Sweet choocoolaates! ♪ Meeeelting iiin my mouth Sooo sweet! Sooo divine! ♬ ...Thank you for the tasty treat. Ho ho, they're a bit misshapen... but so sweet and delicious. Thank you.
</line><line>Kate:
! I am so glad that you enjoyed it!
</line><line>Gregory:
...And above all, it helped you regain your spirit.
</line><line>Master:
Thank you for your concern. The food they serve here has been absolutely tasteless... And combined with the lack of sleep, I was thoroughly exhausted.
</line><line>Ray:
Is the food here that bad?
</line><line>Badd:
...Just salt beef and stew... Your average prison fare.
</line><line>Master:
? That is odd. I really could not taste anything...
</line><line>Gregory:
...?
</line><line>Badd:
...Whatever. I'm about to head out... to the crime scene.
</line><line>Gregory:
Please wait, Detective Badd. Can you give us any new information?
</line><line>Badd:
...Yeah. I think I can... We've identified the victim. Just as you said... Isaac Dover was a sculptor who worked in France. It seems he went by the name... Pierre Hoquet.
</line><line>Master:
Isaac Dover was... Pierre Hoquet...? How could that be...!?
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Pierre Hoquet...
</line><line>Ray:
So Pierre Hoquet wasn't actually French, huh?
</line><line>Gregory:
Which is likely why he never showed himself in public while he worked under that name.
</line><line>Badd:
The "Zodiac Sculptures"... They were his masterpieces, it seems... ...Although they will remain forever unfinished.
</line><line>Ray:
Unfinished...? Even though they were his masterpieces?
</line><line>Badd:
It seems he worked on them... by season... Once he finished... the remaining winter constellations... his work would be done...
</line><line>Ray:
Huh? The winter constellations are... Taurus and Gemini, right?
</line><line>Gregory:
So those ice sculptures were his final pieces.
</line><line>Ray:
It is heartbreaking that they melted...
</line><line>Kate:
I cannot apologize enough...
</line><line>Ray:
Ah! No! I wasn't blaming you or anything...!
</line><line>Badd:
Also... Dover was infamous for being greedy... He would charge... hundreds of thousands... just to make a single sculpture... It seemed like... he always had money troubles. The murder might be related to that... but it's still under investigation.
</line><line>Ray:
So he had money problems even though he was a famous artist?
</line><line>Gregory:
Do you know why he entered a dessert contest?
</line><line>Badd:
...Not yet. He kept it a secret... Even from his family.
</line><line>Gregory:
I see...
</line><line>Badd:
...It's time. I'm bringing in the replacement guard... I can't... hang around here any longer than I have.
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes. I understand. Let's meet again later.
</line><line>Master:
That detective... is a kind soul.
</line><line>Gregory:
Indeed. He never strays from his own beliefs... He truly has a strong will.
</line><line>Ray:
But he's pretty scary when you first meet him!
</line><line>Master:
I see... Could you tell me everything that happened yesterday?
</line><line>Gregory:
Of course. Allow me to give you a report of our investigation.
</line><line>Master:
So this is what happened...? I am sorry for the trouble Kate has caused you.
</line><line>Kate:
I am truly very sorry...
</line><line>Gregory:
...You have no need to worry so long as you have told the truth, Ms. Hall. Mr. Master, would you mind if I asked you a few questions as well?
</line><line>Master:
Yes. I shall divulge all that I know.
</line>

<line>Gregory:
You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?
</line><line>Master:
Yes, the one that was in the same glass case as the Gemini Sculpture.
</line><line>Gregory:
...Please have a look at this picture, Mr. Master. Did you eat from this lyre that's missing the strings?
</line><line>Master:
Yes, that lyre originally had strings. However, I ate them all, resulting in what you see here in this picture.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(So the strings on the lyre were missing because he ate them...)</textEffects> Actually, Delicia ate part of the same lyre that you did. However, she said it was so salty that she could not eat it.
</line><line>Master:
! ...You don't say...! That means... there might be a problem with my sense of taste, after all...
</line><line>Gregory:
A problem with your sense of taste...? How so?
</line><line>Master:
There is a taste disorder called "hypogeusia", in which you <textEffects>lose the ability to taste salt</textEffects>. Perhaps... I have contracted this illness. I just never realized it since I eat nothing but sweets... However, I now know with certainly.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(So that's why he couldn't tell what the food they served here tasted like...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
No...! For a pastry chef to lose their sense of taste is fatal!
</line><line>Gregory:
...Even if there is treatment for taste impairment, there isn't a cure for it yet. But, it's probably best that you let the police know so you can receive a medical examination.
</line><line>Master:
No... That won't be necessary. ...There is a recipe in my mansion specifically for making the cure.
</line><line>Gregory:
A recipe for a drug that will cure your taste impairment?
</line><line>Master:
Yes... Please look for it later when you return to the mansion.
</line><line>Kate:
! Monsieur Master... but that means revealing the...!
</line><line>Master:
Kate... We should no longer conceal it from Mr. Gregory.
</line><line>Kate:
...Yes, sir. I understand. If that is what you wish...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(A recipe for a special drug... Just what are they hiding?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
Well, then... I must be returning to the mansion now, so I will take my leave.
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes, we will be heading there later as well.
</line><line>Master:
...Kate.
</line><line>Kate:
? What is it, Monsieur Master?
</line><line>Master:
You... should not live for my sake.
</line><line>Kate:
!
</line><line>Master:
You should... reconsider your lifestyle. So that you can live by yourself, even if I were no longer around...
</line><line>Kate:
P-Please do not say things like that! I simply cannot live without you, Monsieur Master! I promise to wait for you until you return...! .....Excuse me!
</line><line>Ray:
Ah...! Kate...!
</line><line>Master:
...Katherine...
</line><line>Ray:
Master Jeff... Kate was crying. Why did you say something so cruel...?
</line><line>Master:
...I am worried about her. Katherine always put me... before herself.
</line><line>Gregory:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Master:
She collects Pierre Hoquet's works and makes sweets... ...all to make me happy, nothing more. That is the only reason she does anything.
</line><line>Ray:
!
</line><line>Master:
She always puts aside her own preferences and things that she wants to do herself. ...I want Katherine to choose to live her own life. I do not want her to waste her valuable life because of me.
</line><line>Ray:
Is... that so...?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(He thinks of Ms. Hall as his own daughter. And he would want his children to choose their own path in life. And... a parent would do anything to protect their own children. That feeling... I also know it well.)</textEffects> Well, that should do it for the questions. We must return to the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Master:
Ah... It is already time to leave, I see. So will my tribulations... of questioning... resume...
</line><line>Gregory:
We should take measures against their interrogations from our side as well.
</line><line>Master:
Can you ask the police about that?
</line><line>Gregory:
I can... But I have other ways in mind, as well. ...When the time comes.
</line><line>Master:
Ho ho... You are a dependable man. I shall be counting on you.
</line><line>Ray:
Master Jeff... We'll come here every day with reports of our progress! And we'll bring Kate, too!
</line><line>Master:
Yes... Thank you very much. I shall be looking forward to it.
</line><line>Gregory:
...Mr. Master, know that the police will be attempting to get you to confess. I am sorry to ask an innocent soul like yourself to bear with these painful experiences... ...but please hold on for now. If you confess, I am positive that Von Karma will use that to his advantage. And that will make helping you all that much more difficult.
</line><line>Master:
...I understand. I shall do my best.
</line><line>Gregory:
If you believe in me until the bitter end, I will definitely get you out of here.

...Detective Badd, thank you for helping us earlier.
</line><line>Ray:
Yes, thank you!
</line><line>Badd:
Hmph... Thanks for what?
</line><line>Gregory:
Heh.....
</line><line>Ray:
Ah ha ha ha! There's no need to be shy about it!
</line><line>Badd:
.....Tsk. Enough about that... I suppose... you intend to investigate today too?
</line><line>Gregory:
Of course. We still need more information to prove Mr. Master's innocence.
</line><line>Badd:
I'm sorry... but apart from this patio... you're not allowed to investigate anywhere else.
</line><line>Ray:
What!? So you're saying we can't investigate!?
</line><line>Gregory:
...I'm guessing this is Von Karma's doing?
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. Moreover... the only ones in this mansion are Ms. Hall and the police... So don't get your hopes up... on speaking with the people connected to this case.
</line><line>Ray:
Von Karma's being completely unreasonable! He's gone too far...!
</line><line>Gregory:
.....Detective Badd. What you intend to do?
</line><line>Badd:
I promised... I'll do anything I can... to assist you.
</line><line>Gregory:
...You have my thanks.
</line><line>Ray:
We won't let any of Von Karma's dirty tricks get the best of us!
</line><line>Gregory:
Detective Badd, is it alright if we investigate the Fountain Patio?
</line><line>Badd:
Yes... but we've already finished checking everything, except for the fountain...

That's fine. As long as there is still something, I shall continue investigating.

<line>Gregory:
Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Master... wanted to bring joy to people with his desserts. His parents also wanted him to become a great pastry chef and supported him. When his parents died, the recipe book was left to him as his inheritance.
</line><line>Gregory:
Why would he give away a memento of his parents as a prize in the contest...?
</line><line>Kate:
There were always people who were after it, something which troubled Monsieur Master. But just giving away the memento would have been disrespectful to his parents. So, he decided to pass it over to someone he acknowledged.
</line><line>Badd:
And the members of the Master Group... approved of that? Information about new drugs... being passed on to outsiders...
</line><line>Kate:
...Of course they objected. That's why... Delicia participated in the contest. On the order of the Master Group, she was requested to win the championship.
</line><line>Gregory:
! You knew Delicia's true identity from the start?
</line><line>Kate:
...Yes. In order for her to win, I told her Monsieur Master's tastes and preferences.
</line><line>Gregory:
Why did you help her?
</line><line>Kate:
I helped her... in order to protect Monsieur Master and the Master Group... If the drug recipes were given to another company, he would be reprimanded by the board. I wanted to return the recipes to the company in a way that Monsieur Master would accept...
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(So it was due to Ms. Hall's help that Delicia was able to reach the finals...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Speaking of which, Mr. Dover wasn't a pastry chef either. He sure did well to make it to the finals, considering he's just a sculptor.
</line><line>Kate:
Yes. For him to be able to make such fine desserts despite being a sculptor...!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(From the sherbet sculptures he made for the finals, it's clear to see he has great talent, but... ...could he really have made that by himself?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
That is all I know... Is there anything else I can do to help?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...To save Mr. Master, she's trying to help as much as she can.)</textEffects> May we perhaps have some more of that tea from yesterday please, Ms. Hall? I'm sure that would help us get on with the investigation.
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah! I'd like some of Kate's tea too!
</line><line>Kate:
...Right! Understood. I'll be back in a minute!
</line><line>Ray:
Kate looks a bit better now!

<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(What exactly was he doing in Mr. Dover's room...? And moreover... something is odd about his semifinal entry. A pastry chef bad at design, and a sculptor skilled only at designing...

We have reason to suspect the actions of Dane Gustavia.
</line><line>Badd:
Yeah...
</line><line>Gregory:
It is imperative that we find a way to contact him at once.
</line><line>von Karma:
...Oh? This conversation is most interesting. However... I cannot allow you to speak with Mr. Gustavia.
</line><line>Gregory:
Von Karma...!
</line><line>von Karma:
I have already conducted my interrogation of him. It is not necessary for him to speak any further, especially to a mere defense attorney. Tsk tsk tsk... but I will answer your questions in that fool's place.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...It seems Von Karma intends to prevent me from meeting Gustavia in person.)</textEffects> I understand. In that case, I have but one thing to ask you.
</line><line>von Karma:
...Yes?
</line><line>Gregory:
I would like to know the relationship between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Their Connection --</textEffects></center>
<line>von Karma:
Gustavia and Dover's relationship?
It's obvious the only relationship they had was that they happened to participate in the same contest.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
...That's it?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... There is nothing more to say.
</line><line>Ray:
What! How are we supposed to understand anything from so little...!?
</line><line>Gregory:
If we want Von Karma to divulge the truth, we have no choice but to present evidence. ...It's all too obvious that he's hiding something.

<line>von Karma:
<textEffects>It's obvious the only relationship they had was that they happened to participate in the same contest.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
It would seem Von Karma does not want us to know Gustavia and Dover's real connection.
</line><line>Ray:
Maybe the connection between those two puts the prosecution at a disadvantage?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover should have had <span style="color:#E16935">something in common</textEffects>. I should enlighten Von Karma on this fact.)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts. The desserts were made for the contest's semifinals. ...Don't you think these two have a particularly impressive design?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph! Just what are you getting at?
</line><line>Gregory:
These two desserts were made by Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover. I wouldn't exactly call Mr. Gustavia's design skills praiseworthy. And yet, for the semifinals, he was able to produce something comparable to Mr. Dover's. Furthermore, these two desserts have the exact same flavor.
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
...What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Gregory:
I'm saying it's possible they collaborated with each other on their entries! Prosecutor von Karma. Please take a closer look at their desserts. At first glance, they may look completely different... But even though the designs are different, it's clear they were made from the same materials!
</line><line>von Karma:
......Is that so?
</line><line>Gregory:
The same flavor and composition... It's impossible to dismiss their similarity as coincidence. The very existence of these two desserts points to a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover!
</line><line>von Karma:
...Hmph. Since you already know this much, I'll tell you the truth.
</line><line>Gregory:
! <textEffects>(Did Von Karma know about their collaboration...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
However... what I am about to say is not going to help your case at all.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Their Real Connection --</textEffects></center>
<line>von Karma:
If you want to know about Gustavia and Dover's connection so badly, I'll tell you.
Last night, when I interrogated Gustavia, he told me about his connection with Dover.
Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.
</line>

<line>Gregory:
You knew about their cooperation all this time, didn't you? Why would you conceal the truth?

I would appreciate it if you didn't sully my reputation. Until I explain my points in court, I avoid giving away unnecessary details. I was merely saving you time.

<line>von Karma:
<textEffects>Last night, when I interrogated Gustavia, he told me about his connection with Dover.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>von Karma:
<textEffects>Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>von Karma:
<textEffects>Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>von Karma:
<textEffects>Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
Mr. Master said Mr. Dover was the favorite to win at the finals.
</line><line>Ray:
Which means he must have still been cooperating with Mr. Gustavia at the time, right?
</line><line>Gregory:
...Yes, that is what I believe. <textEffects>(I must have evidence that proves that they still cooperated during the finals...!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
You say that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover did not collaborate during the finals...? That's strange...
</line><line>von Karma:
......
</line><line>Gregory:
Delicia testified that "<textEffects>Dover's sherbet was most delicious.</textEffects>" Being a novice chef, I doubt he could have done all that by himself. Perhaps the two of them cooperated during the finals as well?
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
Defense attorney! How many times do I have to tell you! Delicia Scones' subjective opinion cannot be admitted as evidence! There is still a chance that a novice chef could make something tasty! My wife is an amateur, yet her cooking rivals that of world class chefs!
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(...How is THAT not a subjective opinion!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Moreover... even if you take this pharmacist's testimony to be true, it changes nothing. She also mentioned that a part of his sherbet was very salty. Which means you can hardly call his entry for the finals <textEffects>perfect</textEffects>!
</line><line>Gregory:
N... Nnghhoooh!
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... What, no more objections?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Is there no way I can prove their collaboration...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. There's something that's been bugging me...
</line><line>Gregory:
Hm... What is it?
</line><line>Ray:
The desserts Mr. Dover made for the finals would have taken a long time to make, right?
</line><line>Gregory:
Indeed... They were frozen sculptures after all.
</line><line>Ray:
How would he have had the time to sculpt it after it was frozen? Let alone help Mr. Gustavia with his design as well...
</line><line>Gregory:
!
</line><line>Ray:
The way I see it, just waiting for the sherbet to freeze would have used up all of his time. Hmm... Just how was he able to make those sherbet sculptures?
</line><line>Gregory:
.....Raymond. You may have a promising future after all. Thanks to you, I have noticed one more possibility.
</line><line>Ray:
......?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(That's right... Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly. And the contest's time limit would not have been enough. The method Mr. Dover used to make his sherbet within the time limit was...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
You... Just what are you mumbling about?
</line><line>Gregory:
...Please excuse me. I've finally realized. Your earlier view... was correct.
</line><line>Ray:
Huh!? M-Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Badd:
...What are you doing...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Oh? So you're finally admitting defeat?
</line><line>Gregory:
No... All I am admitting to is the truth of one of your statements. "<textEffects>Dover and Gustavia's collaboration lasted only until the day before the finals</textEffects>." It is exactly as you said, they only cooperated <textEffects>until the day before the finals</textEffects>.
</line><line>von Karma:
.....
</line><line>Gregory:
The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of <textEffects>sherbet</textEffects>. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be <textEffects>left overnight to freeze</textEffects>. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!
</line><line>von Karma:
......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.
</line><line>Gregory:
Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>Gregory:
If you aren't going to answer that, I'll need to get in touch with Mr. Gustavia himself. Or was your interrogation not quite as thorough as you claim?
</line><line>von Karma:
You ingrate... You dare mock me!
</line><line>Gregory:
That was not my intention, but I do have a problem with your attitude. I want you to give us a clear reason why we can't speak to Mr. Gustavia in person.
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph. A clear reason? Gustavia and Dover's collaboration has no bearing on this case.

</line><line>von Karma:
You're saying that Gustavia and Dover's collaboration was linked to the motive for the murder...? If that were the case, why did he not conceal it? After all, we found out about this collaboration from Gustavia himself!
</line><line>Gregory:
!
</line><line>von Karma:
If you really are a lawyer, show us evidence that gives us reason to suspect Gustavia!
</line><line>Gregory:
...... <textEffects>(Only one of Mr. Gustavia's actions has been suspicious so far. Doubtless Von Karma already knows of this facts. This... could be a trap by Von Karma.)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... What's wrong, defense attorney? Not going to answer?
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(But... I mustn't back down now!)</textEffects> Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room. His reasons for this are currently unclear. But the very fact he secretly entered the victim's room is reason enough to suspect him!
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... If that's the extent of it, I can dispel those doubts.
</line><line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(I knew it. Was it a trap after all...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I was intending to save this for the courtroom, but I'll make a special exception. We wouldn't want to prolong the trial with unnecessary information, would we? ....Take a look at this.
</line><line>Gregory:
This is...!
</line><line>von Karma:
This is a photo of Gustavia and Dover... and their sons.
</line><line><textEffects>Family Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
Gustavia entered Dover's room in order to steal this photo.
</line><line>Gregory:
To steal the photo...?
</line><line>von Karma:
It seems their sons attended the same elementary school. Apparently he thought that he'd be suspected if people find out he and Dover were acquainted. Yes... just like you're doing now!
</line><line>Gregory:
Ngh...!
</line><line>von Karma:
There is nothing suspicious about Gustavia's actions! No further room for argument!
</line><line>Gregory:
Nghoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(He's still adamant on not letting us meet with Mr. Gustavia...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
...I have an investigation to return to. I have no more time to waste on the likes of you.
</line><line>Ray:
Curse that Von Karma! Calling us a waste of time! What should we do... Mr. Edgeworth! At this rate, Master Jeff will be...!
</line><line>Gregory:
Von Karma is... busy? <textEffects>(Of course... Why would he be so busy? Both the body and murder weapon have been found, and he already has his suspect. The police should have more than enough evidence to prove Mr. Master's guilt. If that's the case, then why is Von Karma still investigating the crime scene?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth...? Is there something wrong?
</line><line>Gregory:
...It seems I have been overlooking a matter of vital importance. Considering that he already has the evidence he needs to convict Mr. Master... I feel that Von Karma isn't as composed as he should be. He didn't even tell Detective Badd the full results of the investigation.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="No autopsy report - A day after the incident, the autopsy report still has not arrived.">hasn't received the autopsy report.</textEffects></span><textEffects> (No autopsy report - A day after the incident, the autopsy report still has not arrived.)</textEffects></span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Furthermore... something vanished from the crime scene, and we still don't know why.

<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more.

</line><line>Badd:
...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
But the strangest thing we found wasn't in Mr. Master's room at all...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
...It's a match. <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Blood in the water fountain - Traces of Dover&#39;s blood was found in the fountain water.">The blood in the fountain... is Dover's</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Blood in the water fountain - Traces of Dover's blood was found in the fountain water.)</textEffects></span>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Mr. Dover's blood vanished from Mr. Master's room... And somehow found its way into the fountain. What does this mean?)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room... It was detected in the water fountain. There would be no need for the killer to conceal the bloodstains after the body was found. It's unnatural that only the bloodstains that were found with the body disappeared. Unless the body was moved, the blood would have still remained on the chocolate. Don't tell me... someone <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Was the body removed? - Blood vanished from the scene because body was removed?">removed the body</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Was the body removed? - Blood vanished from the scene because body was removed?)</textEffects></span> and then erased the bloodstains?)</span>
</line>

<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene... And the autopsy report still has not arrived. Although we have a murder weapon and a suspect, we don't know much about the body... I've been investigating under <span style="color:#E16935">the assumption that the body had been discovered</textEffects>... Perhaps this <textEffects>assumption</textEffects> was wrong from the very beginning...! Why didn't Von Karma give Detective Badd the autopsy report? To understand that... yes, I must <textEffects>turn my logic around</textEffects>! My thinking shouldn't be "<textEffects>why is Von Karma hiding information about the body</textEffects>." But rather, "<textEffects>what if Von Karma doesn't even have the information to begin with</textEffects>?" ...What happens if I think of it like that? It's possible that the body wasn't removed by the police for autopsy... It was moved and hidden by the real killer!)</span>
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Gregory:
...I've heard many dark rumors surrounding Von Karma. He's a prosecutor who forges evidence, fabricates testimonies and makes backroom deals.
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah, I've heard that too! But... what does that have to do with this?
</line><line>Gregory:
I try to avoid judging others based on rumors. And I didn't let those rumors influence my opinion on Von Karma... Until today. It seems... he is a man who would distort the truth.
</line><line>Ray:
Distort the truth...? You don't mean... forgery...!
</line><line>Gregory:
...I do. <textEffects>(And I can't allow him to get away with this...!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Gregory:
"Police" ...no. My objection is with you!
</line><line>von Karma:
.....What?
</line><line>Gregory:
Isn't it a prosecutor's job to ensure justice for criminals...!?
</line><line>von Karma:
Hmph... What are you saying? I have no time to debate the job of a prosecutor with you. However, I will tell you one more thing. My job is to ensure all those I prosecute are found guilty. Before the perfect proof, there can be no room for doubt.
</line><line>Gregory:

</line><line>Gregory:
And to find that perfect proof, you would even stoop to forgery?
</line><line>von Karma:
Ha! I was wondering what you were going on about... You intend to accuse me of forgery, don't you?
</line><line>Gregory:
.....Yes. And it's for that reason... you did not allow Detective Badd to investigate.
</line><line>von Karma:
...!
</line><line>Badd:
....What do you mean...?
</line><line>Gregory:
The real reason Detective Badd wasn't investigating was not so he could keep an eye on us. It was to hide the fact you never found the body!
</line><line>Badd:
Wha...!
</line><line>Ray:
They never... found the body...?
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
You cretins! You WILL cease with these ludicrous accusations! I will not tolerate any further insults!
</line><line>Gregory:
In that case, let us verify the body! If you do, we will have evidence that shows whether I am right or not!
</line><line>von Karma:
.....Ngh! Tsk tsk tsk... The burden of proof falls on you, defense attorney! I have no reason to comply with your baseless conjecture!
</line><line>Gregory:

</line><line>Gregory:
You must have noticed it too. The lack of bloodstains at the crime scene. So why did the blood vanish? And more importantly... Where did it go?
</line><line>von Karma:
Foolishness. Why would anyone erase just the blood in the chest that contained the body!?
</line><line>Gregory:
Yes... that's exactly right. If the body had been found there, the disappearing bloodstains would have no meaning at all. ...However, what if the body was already gone? To erase the traces of the body being there, one would have to get rid of the bloodstains as well!
</line><line>von Karma:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>von Karma:
Why make such a fuss over those bloodstains. It seems like a trivial detail to me. Or, are you saying that you can show me where those bloodstains went!?
</line><line>Gregory:
"<textEffects>In court, everything must be said with evidence.</textEffects>" ...Isn't that right, Von Karma? In that case, I'll show you the evidence supporting my claim! <textEffects>(Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Gregory:
There were traces of <textEffects>the victim's blood</textEffects> found in the fountain.
</line><line>von Karma:
.....
</line><line>Gregory:
Traces of Mr. Master's chocolate were also found in this very fountain. In other words, the blood was washed down the stream, which then flowed into the fountain. All of this points to only one possibility! After the body was removed, someone erased the bloodstains!
</line><line>von Karma:
Gah.....!
</line><line>Gregory:
Von Karma. Where was the body really found? If you really found the body, you should be able to answer!
</line><line>von Karma:
...You... How, how do you know this information!? How do you know the results of the water composition test on the fountain...!?
</line><line>Badd:
...Because I allowed them to investigate.
</line><line>von Karma:
Badd...! Always a thorn in my side...! From here on out, I will not allow you to associate any further with this case!
</line><line>Badd:
Hmph... it's not like you were letting me do much anyway...
</line><line>Gregory:
...Von Karma. You still haven't answered my question. Or... are you admitting to the fact that you didn't find the body after all?
</line><line>von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... You say I never found the body? Where is your evidence?
</line><line>Gregory:
! <textEffects>(He's never going to confess...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>von Karma:
I have nothing further to say to you. Gregory Edgeworth... This matter will be decided in court. We'll see just how well your logic holds up there!
</line><line>Gregory:
Von Karma...! I know your methods are wrong! I promise, without fail... I will expose the truth you've hidden!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
...Detective Badd, I'm sorry. It's because you let me investigate that...
</line><line>Badd:
No... this was bound to happen... sooner or later. This is also... the first time... I have been restricted in my investigation... ...Your theory that they never found the body sounds pretty close to the mark.
</line><line>Gregory:
That... I will make clear in court.
</line><line>Badd:
Heh... if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Even though... I'm no longer in charge of this case...
</line><line>Gregory:
Then... though I'm very sorry about this, I have one more favor to ask of you.
</line><line>Ray:
Hey, what are you guys whispering about? I wanna know too!
</line><line>Gregory:
Heh... this will be my trump card in court. The information I've gathered up until now should be enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence. ...But, if all else fails, I'll have this ready.
</line><line>Ray:
Your trump card...?
</line><line>Gregory:
He heh... you'll see at the trial.
</line><line>Ray:
Wow! I get to be at the trial too!?
</line><line>Gregory:
Of course. You are my assistant after all.
</line><line>Ray:
He he heh... I'll be an Ace Attorney too next year! Von Karma will never beat the two of us!
</line><line>Gregory:
...Right. Although I hope to clear Mr. Master's name before you become a lawyer... If Von Karma is to be my opponent... he'll want the trial ended in a day.
</line><line>Ray:
That's right... we have to save Master Jeff as fast as we can! After all, this is you we're talking about... I'm sure you'll beat Von Karma!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
<textEffects>(Jeff Master, alone in a dark cell, arrested on false charges. I must expose Von Karma's lies if I am to save him...!)</textEffects>

<line>Ray:
...And that's all Uncle Ray knows about the IS-7 Incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So that's what happened in my father's last case... The truth of the IS-7 Incident.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
What happened at the trial?
</line><line>Ray:
In the end... Von Karma defeated us.
</line><line>Kay:
Eh...! So, you couldn't prove Mr. Master's innocence?
</line><line>Ray:
We had gathered plenty of evidence to prove it. But, Von Karma was even more despicable than we thought.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He was... a prosecutor who would do anything for his guilty verdict.
</line><line>Ray:
That's right... and he really did use any means necessary. Because of this, the trial dragged on for about a year, until it finally reached a conclusion. I'll never forget that fateful day, when the judgement was passed down. The 28th of December. It's April now... So it's been a little over 17 years. How time flies...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...The 28th of December, 17 years ago. I was watching from the gallery that day...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
...Before the trial, your old man noticed that Mr. Master was acting strangely. He was at the breaking point, both mentally and physically. He wanted to be found guilty...
</line><line>Kay:
No... Mr. Master didn't fake a confession, did he...?
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah... That was what Von Karma was aiming for from the start. When your old man tried to expose the fact that the body had not been found... ...Von Karma used the power of his police cronies to quash that argument. ...He even went as far as to prepare a fake autopsy report. Then... they made Mr. Master give a false testimony, and confess to being an accomplice. With Mr. Master's confession, the situation quickly became dire... But... your old man had a trump card up his sleeve.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was that the <textEffects>trump card</textEffects> he was talking to Detective Badd about...?
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah. That trump card was to be our insurance, in case Mr. Master confessed. He had asked Detective Badd to have Mr. Master's interrogation recorded.
</line><line>Kay:
Detective Badd... wanted to know the truth too, huh.
</line><line>Ray:
After he was dropped from the investigation, he never stopped caring about the case. Even when he was involved with other large cases... He really was the definition of a true detective. The defense presented the recording, which proved that the confession was forced. Well, it seems the detective in charge of the initial investigation and interrogation... ...Rip Lacer, took all of the blame and was charged and dismissed. Still, at the trial, your old man exposed Von Karma's corruption, and... ...Von Karma received his first penalty from the then chief prosecutor.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The only penalty in his 40 years of prosecution...
</line><line>Ray:
However... Mr. Master didn't want the trial to continue any longer. And the curtains closed on the trial that day with the verdict of "guilty"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(My memory of that time is fuzzy, but... I was also there, watching my father's final trial. And I think his final regret... became my own.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Your old man wanted a retrial to prove Master's innocence. But... he passed on before he could fulfill his wish... ...after getting entangled in another case...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Ray:
It breaks my heart even now... that I didn't return home with him that day. And what's more, to blind myself from my own worthlessness... ...Uncle Ray put all of his hatred on you, as a traitor for being Von Karma's pupil. ...I'm sorry.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't be... It's natural you would hate me. After I became a prosecutor... I was able to get Von Karma to show me the case file. Mr. Master was found guilty for the murder of Isaac Dover...
</line><line>Ray:
...Eh, that's not right. Wasn't Mr. Master found guilty of being an <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, this case file says, "<textEffects>guilty of murder</textEffects>"... There shouldn't be anything unresolved in the cases handled by Manfred von Karma.
</line><line>Ray:
...Wait, can I take a look at that file?&#160;! ...It looks the charges have been re-written.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha...!
</line><line>Ray:
Look at this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The charge is... "<textEffects>accomplice to murder</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Ray:
This is a copy of the original case file I received from the courts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why would the charge be altered?
</line><line>Ray:
This file... was given to you by Von Karma, right? Maybe he just didn't want you to know the truth, since you're Gregory's son. He would have wanted to avoid another retrial before the statute of limitations ran out after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So what I had come to believe back then, had all been a lie...
</line><line>Ray:
...If you didn't know about it, just make sure you know it from now on.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
The statute of limitations has long expired, but the truth still sleeps, right here. After your old man passed away, Uncle Ray took over as Mr. Master's defense attorney. Although Von Karma also had another prosecutor take over the case... Perhaps he thought that since his opponent was a rookie... he didn't even need to turn up. In the end the real killer was never found... and Mr. Master was found guilty.
</line><line>Kay:
No...! Is there nothing we can do, even now?
</line><line>Ray:
Since the killer was never found, he can't withdraw his confession. I found out after the trial that... ...Mr. Master made a deal with Von Karma because Von Karma had threatened him... "<textEffects>If you don't confess, Katherine Hall will be held under the same charges</textEffects>."
</line><line>Kay:
That's terrible...!
</line><line>Ray:
I don't think Mr. Master really thought that Kate was the killer, but... ...to protect her, he faked a confession. ...Miles. On the day that Knightley-boy was killed, why do you think Uncle Ray was at the prison?
</line><line>Kay:
...Ah, I see!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You went to see Mr. Master, didn't you...?
</line><line>Ray:
I said I'd visit him every day. I couldn't keep that promise, but... ...I asked Katie-pie to look in on him for me when I couldn't. Through rain or snow she went... every single day without fail. But... nothing has changed, and Mr. Master still serves his punishment.
</line><line>Kay:
That's so sad...! Isn't there anything we can do?
</line><line>Ray:
...That's why I came here. Because, I knew those "<textEffects>ice sculptures</textEffects>" would be on display here today. ...So, what are you going to do, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am a prosecutor. My position is different from you and my father...
</line><line>Ray:
Miles...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, moving past my position, what I want as Miles Edgeworth... Is to know the truth of these two cases. It is for that reason that... I am here.
</line><line>Ray:
He he he... You really are your father's son. Well then! If that's what you've decided, I'll support you all the way! I'd better leave the IS-7 documents and evidence with you then! Alright, here are the documents. By the way, the parts in <textEffects>orange</textEffects> are Uncle Ray's old notes.
</line><line><textEffects>IS-7 Incident File updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Thank you.
</line><line>Ray:
And now, here's the IS-7 evidence. There's a lot, so make sure to look it over while you investigate.
</line><line><textEffects>Received a lot of IS-7 evidence from Mr. Shields.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm... Right. <textEffects>(I'll check through it later...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Anyway, there are so many strange things about this case.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed... Those involved in the case 18 years ago have reunited, and another incident occurs... <textEffects>(Replicas of the statues from 18 years ago were displayed in the Winter Palace, and... Poison gas was released in the Autumn Palace, which had been disguised as the Winter Palace. The two chemicals in the Pisces case... Normallium and Fatallium, were mixed, causing an outbreak of poison gas... The victim of the poison gas was Dane Gustavia. A person involved in the IS-7 Incident. Because he was unconscious, he received treatment in the Zodiac Art Gallery's infirmary... Finally, the dead body found floating in the fountain... ...And once again, the ice sculptures have melted.)</textEffects> There are deep connections between the two cases. ...It's possible there are still some clues left from 18 years ago.
</line><line>Kay:
Right! Let's get started!
</line><line>Debeste:

</line><line>Debeste:
Juuuust one second! Don't tell me you've forgotten about me? Didn't I tell you that I'm the one in charge of this case?
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. If you intend to continue disrupting Sebastian's investigation... ...the world "Guilty" will be added to your P.I.C. report.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...What does she mean "guilty"?)</textEffects> Please allow me to assist in your investigation as before.
</line><line>Courtney:
I appreciate your proposal, but I'm afraid I must overrule it.
</line><line>Kay:
...That was fast.
</line><line>Courtney:
Even though we're short on hands to identify the victim right now... ..it's only a matter of time until we figure it out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...In that case, I shall take that load off your shoulders at once. Regarding the identity of the unidentified body... One person comes to mind.
</line><line>Debeste:
Really!? Then tell us!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Very well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago... The body in the fountain is...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occurred here 18 years ago. ...Isaac Dover.
</line><line>Delicia:
Ehhhhhh! It's Icy's body!?
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey! Who's that!? I've never heard of him!
</line><line>Courtney:
Mr. Isaac Dover... A truly great sculptor. But he was better known as Pierre Hoquet. The sculptures on display here in the museum are all his creations.
</line><line>Debeste:
Ah, so in other words, that sculptor was the best. Somehow, I feel a strong kinship to him.
</line><line>Courtney:
And... he was the victim in the IS-7 Incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! <textEffects>(She knew about the IS-7 Incident...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. The IS-7 Incident occurred 18 years ago. And what's more, the police reported the removal of the body.
</line><line>Ray:
That's what's on the record. But... I wonder if that really is the truth?
</line><line>Courtney:
...What are you saying?
</line><line>Ray:
The defense attorney in the IS-7 Incident claimed that the body was never found. ...Not that the prosecution would ever admit to such a thing.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....
</line><line>Debeste:
Hello... Eh! Really!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Is something wrong, Sebastian?
</line><line>Debeste:
No... it's just, they said that they know who the victim is.
</line><line>Courtney:
!
</line><line>Debeste:
It's just as that prosecutor says, it's <textEffects>Dover</textEffects>...
</line><line>Courtney:
No... it can't be!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... <textEffects>(It would seem my father's suspicion were correct.)</textEffects> What is it, Judge Courtney? Have you finally realized that I'm much helpful than Mr. Debeste?
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey... You! Are you trying to steal Debeste position for yourself!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm doing no such thing. I just want to know the truth. And for that to happen, we need to cooperate, no?
</line><line>Courtney:
The truth... is none of your concern.
</line><line>Ray:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ray:
I don't think that's true, Courtney-pie.
</line><line>Courtney:
You again...!
</line><line>Ray:
Uncle Ray assisted the defense attorney involved in the IS-7 Incident. The one who claimed that Mr. Dover's body was never found.
</line><line>Courtney:
.....!
</line><line>Ray:
The prosecution denied it at the time, but now the body has been discovered here. ...In other words, the IS-7 investigation was unjust. And, isn't it the duty of the P.I.C. to investigate corrupt prosecutors?
</line><line>Courtney:
Uuuh....!
</line><line>Ray:
Then, wouldn't you want to cooperate with those who were involved in the case? ...Unless, you have an ulterior motive?
</line><line>Courtney:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now that I think about it... Judge Courtney knew about the IS-7 Incident. So it would seem she really is here because of the P.I.C.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Even if you're related to the incident, I don't see how Prosecutor Edgeworth is.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ray:
He is the son of the attorney in that case, and a prosecutor taught by Von Karma himself. And what's more... he was in the audience at the IS-7 trial. I'm sure there are many points he can enlighten us on.
</line><line>Courtney:
Urgh...! ...Very well. I will allow you to cooperate. However, your investigation must not hinder the other investigators. The Winter Palace is currently being investigated, but the Fountain Patio is open to you.
</line><line>Ray:
That's my Courtney-pie! Now we're talking! As thanks, I will allow you to have a hug with Uncle Ray!
</line><line>Courtney:
Overruled. If I feel your cooperation isn't needed, I will have to ask you to leave.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Understood.
</line><line>Ray:
Ahh... Isn't that great, Miles? Now we can start investigating.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You really helped us there.
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. Uncle Ray did it all for himself.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph...
</line><line>Ray:
Alright! Uncle Ray's going to investigate too, so let me know if you figure something out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Got it. Right then... Kay, let's begin the investigation.
</line><line>Kay:
OK! Let's do this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We still don't know... ...where Mr. Dover's body and the Normallium were hidden.
</line><line>Kay:
We don't have enough information to go on.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're right. Our first priority is the Normallium.
</line><line>Kay:
Well, Normallium is used in washing detergents, paints and the like.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If I recall... it's a red liquid with a <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.">minty aroma</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.)</textEffects></span>.

...Madame and Messieurs. Would you care for some tea?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Larry:
Aah...! K-Katie...! N-No... I'm fine, thanks. Kay and Edgey, you guys can have some!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...? Well... Since you asked, we might as well take a short break.
</line><line>Kate:
Certainly.
</line><line>Kay:
Thanks for the tea! Wow! It's so tasty! ...What kind of tea is this, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's Ceylon tea. Known for its citrus aroma. However... Ms. Hall, is this the same tea you served us this morning?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes, that's right... Was it not to your liking?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, it's not that...

Wh-What's wrong with you, Edgey! Quit nitpicking about the tea Katie so kindly prepared for you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Larry... What are you getting so upset about?
</line><line>Larry:
I-I'm not upset! You're just being a rude jerk! And I told you to call me Laurice! Sheesh! I'm not gonna talk to you anymore!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...It's like arguing with a child...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Laurice... I wonder what's wrong?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask him that later myself. <textEffects>(And... I also need to speak with Ms. Hall. I don't have any evidence that shows she is the culprit, but... ...I dare say she is the one who set up the poison gas trap.)</textEffects>

Larry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch.
</line><line>Larry:
Huh? You want a lecture on sketching from the famed Professor Laurice, do ya?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... I just need to ask you something. The tablecloth in your sketch, are you sure it was <textEffects>light blue</textEffects>?
</line><line>Larry:
Yeah, my eyes never fail me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, the one on the service cart here is white, isn't it?
</line><line>Larry:
.........Dude. You're always so busy thinking with just your head, that you miss the obvious.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What's with that look on your face!
</line><line>Larry:
When I drew that painting... I was using the cart with the tea set on it, remember? Because I was tidying up the broken pottery shards!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's not something to be proud of!
</line><line>Larry:
And right then, Katie came out of the Winter Palace. I had to hurry and hide the broken teapot, so that she wouldn't notice it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did you just say... Ms. Hall came out of the Winter Palace?
</line><line>Larry:
That's right. But this time, she was pushing another service cart. And the tablecloth was light blue, just like how I drew it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did she do with that service cart?
</line><line>Larry:
Beats me. She went into the Summer Palace with it, so I don't know. And when she came out, she was pushing the lift trolley.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The lift trolley...?
</line><line>Larry:
When I called out to her, she was so surprised that she just left it there. ...She's so cute when she's shy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A second service cart... and a lift trolley...
</line><line>Kay:
Maybe there were two tea sets along with two service carts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...We'll have to verify it with Ms. Hall.

<textEffects>! There's still liquid in the glass cases?</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! We just investigated the <textEffects>light blue liquid</textEffects> a moment ago. We only detected sugar in the Taurus case, but... ...for some reason, in the Gemini case, we detected three different substances.

<textEffects>Three substances...?</textEffects>

It's just like Mr. Edgeworth said!
</line><line>Debeste:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. It seems like you have an obsession about being the best... But when you're on a case, winning and losing is of no importance.
</line><line>Debeste:
What are you saying...? Obviously, it's best to be the best at everything!

</line><line>Courtney:
Well then... Ms. Curator. Can you tell us why Normallium was discovered in the teapot?
</line><line>Kate:
I was not aware that it contained such a chemical. I suppose it may have been an ingredient from the detergent I had used.
</line><line>Courtney:
...So you're saying that you did not put it in deliberately?
</line><line>Kate:
No. Of course not. There is no way for me to have known how to create the poison gas.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Despite being a former actress, ...it seems you're not very good at lying.
</line><line>Kate:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Angel's Recipe is in your possession. And the method to create the poison gas is contained inside that recipe book. So you must have known how to create it!
</line><line>Kate:
...I'm surprised you knew about that.
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. Curator, is this true?
</line><line>Kate:
...It's true that information about the poison gas is contained in one of the recipes. However, just because I saw it does not mean that I was responsible for the crime. Could you tell me what set off the poison gas?
</line><line>Courtney:
It was caused by the victim heating the lid of the glass case with a burner.
</line><line>Kate:
Ha ha... I see. If he locked himself in that room of his own will and then set off the poison gas... ...wouldn't that suggest "<textEffects>suicide</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Does she intend to deny it until the bitter end...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
Futhermore, I wouldn't have been able to obtain a chemical like Megatoxin X.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That may be true, but you could have stolen it from someone else.
</line><line>Delicia:
That reminds me. I met up with Katie a week ago and... ...that night was when I realized that my Megatoxin X was gone! Katie... you couldn't have...!
</line><line>Kate:
...Madame Delicia always carried her medicine bag around with her. Anyone could have stolen it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's right... I don't have any proof that she was the one who stole it...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Katie. Can't you tell us what you're hiding? I know you're not the kind of person who would hurt someone without a reason.
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Shields... You doubt me as well?
</line><line>Ray:
...Setting a trap on one of the gallery's exhibits, and then disguising the rooms... I just think it would have been impossible for anyone but the curator...
</line><line>Kate:
.....That's not true. There are no guards or security cameras at this gallery. If any ill-intentioned person wanted to sneak into the gallery... ...it would have been an easy task for them.
</line><line>Kay:
Th-Then, isn't it like an all-you-can-steal buffet in here!? ...You have to be careful! You never know when a Great Thief could appear.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It doesn't sound like a joke when Kay says it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
...Actually, Monsieur Gustavia apparently entered the gallery before it opened.
</line><line>Ray:
...Well, I'm beat. Looks like Uncle Ray can't do anything to break down Kate's iron guard. Hmm. This might be a good time to use the technique your old man taught me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The techinque... my father taught you?
</line><line>Ray:
This case is deeply connected to the one from 18 years ago. If we just pursue the present case, it may seem like there is a lot we don't understand... But if we try turning things around, there might be a hint in the case from the past.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"<textEffects>Thinking the other way around</textEffects>"...! <textEffects>(Did my father do that too?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
For example... just consider the relationship between the past case and Kate...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! <textEffects>(Ms. Hall melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures 18 years ago... And today, Mr. Dover's works are on display in this gallery. It can't be, she...!)</textEffects> I see... Now I know what to ask her.
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. That's good to hear. In that case, Uncle Ray will just watch over you as you do your work.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ms. Katherine Hall. 18 years ago, it seems that you melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures.
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... I was young and inexperienced, and I did something inexcusable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, isn't that why you were able to open the Zodiac Art Gallery?
</line><line>Kate:
...I don't know what you mean.
</line><line>Courtney:
I don't understand either. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you seek her testimony?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. I would like her to tell me about the Zodiac Art Gallery. I would like to know the reason you decided to open a gallery for Mr. Dover's artwork.
</line><line>Courtney:
If you insist that this is related to the case at hand... I will allow it. Ms. Curator. Your testimony, if you please.
</line><line>Kate:
Very well... if that will clear your suspicions about me...
</line><line>Courtney:
Now then, please testify about the Zodiac Art Gallery.

<line>Courtney:
It's wonderful that your dream has come true. What do you think, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I don't believe there was anything strange about her testimony.

</line><line>Kate:
...I can't believe you've already uncovered so much.
</line><line>Courtney:
So you're admitting that you stole the sherbet sculptures?
</line><line>Kate:
...No. I cannot admit to such a thing. There isn't any proof that I stole them, after all. Also... I couldn't have stolen the sculptures 18 years ago. I don't think they would've been easy to steal without the police noticing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Is that so? I don't know what you did 18 years ago. As such, how can I judge how difficult it would have been to steal them?
</line><line>Kate:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I never said she used the "<textEffects>service cart</textEffects>" to move the sculptures.
</line><line>Courtney:
What...!? What do you mean? Then what did she use to move the sculptures around!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>This is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
And this is...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the lift trolley Mr. Dover used 18 years ago to move his sherbet sculptures. It seems this same lift trolley lies here, in the Fountain Patio.
</line><line>Kate:
...That's because it was originally prepared for the contest in the first place.
</line><line>Courtney:
Are you saying she used the lift trolley to move the sculptures?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. If the sculptures were placed on this lift trolley, and then covered with a tablecloth... ...it could be disguised as a service cart, and moved without arousing suspicion!
</line><line>Courtney:
H-How could that be...!?
</line><line>Ray:
...So the saucers were chilled because they were sitting on the ice sculptures?
</line><line>Kate:
......
</line><line>Ray:
Kate...! What's the meaning of this? What were you thinking...!?
</line><line>Kate:
...... That was truly impressive.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Kate:
You certainly are... Monsieur Gregory's son. After 18 years... it's hard to imagine any proof that I stole the sculptures remained... But, I knew it was only a matter of time until I was suspected.
</line><line>Courtney:
Ms. Curator. Does this mean you admit to stealing the sculptures?
</line><line>Kate:
...Yes. I admit it. 18 years ago, I stole the sherbet sculptures from Monsieur Dover's room. It's just as Monsieur Edgeworth says. I disguised the lift trolley as a service cart. And I served tea as I made my way back and forth. That wasn't all. I also took the ice block with all the star clusters on it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(An ice block with star clusters on it...? That seems familiar...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The Winter Palace is a <span style="color:#E16935">reproduction</textEffects> of Mr. Dover's room from 18 years ago. Because they had melted, my father never got the chance to see them... But those blocks of ice were also originally from Dover's Sherbet Salon.)</span>
</line><line>Kate:
The two sculptures and the two blocks of ice, I took everything I could... ...and then I placed empty glass cases in Monsieur Dover's room. The sculptures were all encased in glass to preserve their fine details... ...but the ice blocks were being displayed as they were. As per the rules, we prepared the glass cases for Mr. Dover.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hm. So it would have been easy for her to prepare the glass cases...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
In Monsieur Dover's room, there were some sculptures that were still unfinished. I thought I melted them, it would look like the ones I stole had melted too... So, everything you see in the Winter Palace are all original works from 18 years ago.
</line><line>Kay:
Ms. Hall... It didn't take much to get her to confess.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Then she must know. She knows it isn't enough to try her in court.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
That is all I have to say. But... Even though I admit to stealing the sculptures, you can't arrest me for it.
</line><line>Kay:
What!? Wh-What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Courtney:
Heavens! You're assisting an investigation without knowing this much? Perhaps you should read this book concerning the "<textEffects>Statute of Limitations</textEffects>".
</line><line>Kay:
S-Statute of limitations...?
</line><line><textEffects>Statute of Limitation data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
To put it simply... ...it's the <textEffects>time frame</textEffects> in which a suspect can be taken to court. ...You can see it on this page.
</line><line>Kay:
The statute of limitations for murder is 15 years, and for theft it's <textEffects>7 years</textEffects>..... AH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right... And Ms. Hall's theft was <textEffects>18 years ago</textEffects>. According to statute, she cannot be arrested for stealing the sculptures.
</line><line>Kay:
So that's how it is...
</line><line>Courtney:
Stealing evidence from a crime scene is an unforgivable offense. However, for this crime at least, we have no right to pass judgement. ...it appears that Prosecutor Edgeworth's tepid reasoning has all been for naught.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I wonder about that. I deduced Ms. Hall's actions simply to expose a different crime. If she only took the sculptures, we wouldn't have found the <textEffects>body from 18 years ago</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kate:
...Are you saying that I hid Monsieur Dover's body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's correct.
</line><line>Kay:
But, how can someone hide a body for 18 years?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I would imagine it would be very difficult, under normal circumstances.
</line><line>Kay:
So you're saying the circumstances weren't... normal...?
</line><line>Courtney:
Are you claiming that you knew where the body was hidden?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When you consider Ms. Hall's actions, the answer becomes obvious. 18 years ago, Ms. Hall stole something more than just sherbet sculptures.
</line><line>Courtney:
If you're so confident, I would like to hear your answer. <textEffects>Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
This is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, and perhaps you've noticed that the victim's body can be seen in this picture?
</line><line>Courtney:
.....I do not see it. Please point it out clearly. Where in this picture can one see the body of the victim?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
The Gemini Sculpture...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... While it may look like the Gemini Sculpture at first glance... ...in reality, this is none other than Isaac Dover himself!
</line><line>Courtney:
This... This ice sculpture was the victim's body...? But all I can see from this picture is an ice sculpture statue...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's because a certain piece of evidence was used to conceal it.
</line><line>Courtney:
Conceal it...? <textEffects>Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
This is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This cloth manipulates light. With it, it's entirely possible to make something look like ice. Isn't that right, Delicia?
</line><line>Delicia:
Yessie! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice!
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
That cloth will only emit light when it is attached to a special device!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney... Look closely at the picture one more time. Beneath the Gemini case... lies a box-shaped object attached to the pedestal.
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-This is...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A <textEffects>rainbow light device</textEffects>. Detective Gumshoe reported one in the Winter Palace. This is the device that went missing 18 years ago. Originally, it would have been attached to the cloth inside the glass case. Naturally, Ms. Hall took the device with her when she moved the sculptures. By using the rainbow light device to make the fluorescent cloth glow... ...Mr. Dover's body was made to look like an ice sculpture!
</line><line>Courtney:
That's... ridiculous...!
</line><line>Ray:
So then, when Uncle Ray took a photo of the Winter Palace...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. The body had been in front of us all along, disguised as Gemini!
</line><line>Courtney:
However, the body and the fluorescent cloth were both discovered in the fountain. If the ice sculpture was the body, we would have found it in the Winter Palace!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we had found it there, her trick would have been revealed immediately. Ms. Hall moved the body out of the Winter Palace to prevent us from discovering it.
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
Absurd. You say she threw the body into the fountain without any of us noticing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, Judge Courtney... There was no need for that. She simply used the same method as before. Remember the lift trolley...?
</line><line>Courtney:
A... Aaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
She moved the body to some other room and dumped it into the stream to the fountain. ...Naturally, the frozen body would have sunk to the bottom of the fountain. That's why the cloth floated up first, and was found by Delicia.
</line><line>Courtney:
And eventually, the body thawed out and floated to the surface...?
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth. You truly have a gift for deductive reasoning. However... do you have any proof that I moved the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Kate:
If you cannot prove that, then there is no way I can accept what you are saying.
</line><line>Kay:
Hrmm... Wasn't there anyone who saw Ms. Hall move the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, I believe such a person exists. <textEffects>(The answers lie in the evidence that person gave me... And that piece of evidence will reveal the truth of Ms. Hall's actions.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you able to prove the crime of Ms. Curator?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Certainly. I have evidence that will show exactly what she did.
</line><line>Courtney:
Then, it's time we see your answer. <textEffects>Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
...Another sketch? ...Oh? It appears I have been drawn in this one...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is a sketch Larry drew of the women at the Fountain Patio. I would like to direct your attention to the <textEffects>service cart</textEffects> on the left side of the sketch.
</line><line>Courtney:
Service cart...? What about it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Don't you see? What transpired 18 years ago has happened again. Ms. Hall was moving... the body in this sketch!
</line><line>Courtney:
No...!
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kate:
...Please wait. I don't see Monsieur Dover's body anywhere in that drawing. All I did was hand out chocolates to everyone.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The key detail in this sketch is the <textEffects>color of the tablecloth</textEffects>. Up until now, I thought Larry had just made a mistake.
</line><line>Courtney:
...The tablecloth. It's light blue.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It may be light blue in the sketch, but no blue tablecloths exist in this mansion. Perhaps it's light blue because the body was hidden, still glowing, underneath the tablecloth.
</line><line>Courtney:
What...! B-But... the lift trolley is rectangular in the sketch! If she just placed the body in the lift trolley, we would notice it immediately!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There were two blocks of ice in the Winter Palace that are completely hollowed out. If she put the body inside the block of ice, it would look like a service cart.
</line><line>Courtney:
That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ms. Hall. You put the body in the block of ice and used the lift trolley to move it, didn't you?
</line><line>Kate:
I... I never imagined you would be able to deduce so much from just a single sketch. ...But what if it was just a mistake, like you said before? It doesn't prove anything.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... I agree that alone the sketch is worthless.
</line><line>Kate:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Once you removed the body, the "service cart" would revert back to a lift trolley. That's why the lift trolley was left behind in the Fountain Patio. And without the service cart, there would be no place for you to put your chocolates.
</line><line>Kate:
The chocolates I gave everyone...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Until then, the chocolates had sat on top of the service cart as you gave them away... ...but when you gave them to us, you took them from your pocket.
</line><line>Kate:
Ah... Now that you mention it, they were a bit melted. But they were still really sweet and tasty!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, why was it necessary to put them in your pocket halfway through?
</line><line>Kate:
Th-That's because...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's because once the body was disposed of, you no longer had a service cart.
</line><line>Kate:
...Aaah!
</line><line>Courtney:
Hold it right there. If she put the chocolates in her pocket, and left the lift trolley in the patio. Then... Where did the tablecloth go?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If she had been forced to put the chocolates in her pocket... ...she wouldn't have had time to dispose of the tablecloth!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Can you answer that for me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The tablecloth wasn't hidden. It's right in front of us.
</line><line>Courtney:
...Do clarify. The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open.
</line><line>Courtney:
Out in the open...? Ah...! Y-You mean...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. You are... wearing the tablecloth around your waist!
</line><line>Kate:
......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The block of ice was not encased in a glass case. In other words, the tablecloth was in direct contact with the block of ice. If we have it examined, we will undoubtedly find traces of sherbet on it. ...Ms. Hall. You will turn your tablecloth over to the police at once!
</line><line>Kate:
...... .....There's no need to examine the tablecloth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Kate:
...It is just as you say. I stole the poison from Madame Delicia, and I moved the body... I have done... I have done terrible things.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kate:
Madame Delicia... I am so sorry. One week ago, I took your Megatoxin X bottle. I slipped it into that man's pocket... to make it look like suicide. And if they suspected it was murder, the evidence would point to Madame Delicia.

<line>Delicia:
Eep! K-Katie?
</line><line>Ray:
Kate...! What were you thinking...? Weren't we always trying to save Mr. Master together!?
</line><line>Kate:
I... could not let myself be arrested. Not until... I had proven Monsieur Master's innocence...! From the very beginning, I had planned to turn myself in once everything was over... ...but I suppose it is too late to say that now.
</line><line>Ray:
Kate... Why? Why would you go this far...?
</line><line>Kate:
...Even for Monsieur Shields, I've caused nothing but trouble. For the past 18 years... I have been a criminal.
</line><line>Courtney:
The IS-7 Incident... Don't tell me that you were the true culprit?
</line><line>Kate:
My greatest crime was stealing the sherbet sculptures for my own selfish interests. When Monsieur Dover died... they were no longer just ordinary sculptures. They had become the final works of the sculptor Monsieur Master so deeply loved. What if... What if they melted before Monsieur Master returned? With that in mind, I couldn't let anyone touch them, not even the police... Even though I knew it was wrong, I moved them to the mansion's freezer... However... I only wanted to preserve Monsieur Dover's art. I did not know his body was hidden among them...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So she stole the sculptures without noticing the body...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Master would never take another person's life. But, because of me, the body vanished, and Monsieur Master was found... Guilty...! That kind man... he treated someone like me as family. He meant more to me than anyone else, and yet...!
</line><line>Ray:
Kate...
</line><line>Kate:
When Monsieur Master was found guilty, I was chased out of this mansion. I was finally able to reclaim the mansion just a few days ago, but... ...when I saw the sculptures still sleeping away in the freezer, I realized... ...that I was the one who hid Monsieur Dover's body. However... the statute of limitations had already expired. Therefore, I... ...could think of no other way to atone for my sins...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..... <textEffects>(...It appears I have misunderstood her. It seems... she caused this entire incident in order to save Mr. Master.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Whatcha thinking about, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...There is one thing that has been bothering me this whole time. Why would Ms. Hall plan a murder with such an uncertain method like poison gas? And, the reason she disguised the Autumn Palace to look like the Winter Palace... ...was to make those involved in the incident 18 years ago confuse the two rooms.
</line><line>Kay:
I wonder what Kate was trying to accomplish...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She was trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence... In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?)</textEffects> Ms. Hall... Were you trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence?
</line><line>Kate:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You wanted to reveal the true culprit and have the police find the body from 18 years ago... Was that not your true goal?
</line><line>Kate:
.....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By displaying those sculptures, you'd attract those involved in the past incident. Only two people would know where the body was hidden. You... and the true culprit.
</line><line>Ray:
The culprit would've panicked, knowing that the body would be displayed publicly...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. And if the culprit really showed up, there's the risk they'd erase their tracks. In the worst-case scenario, they might have even stolen the body. So, how could she protect the evidence while simultaneously luring in the culprit?
</line><line>Ray:
...I see. That's why she made the Autumn Palace look like the Winter Palace...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. And then... Ms. Hall, you must have thought... ...<textEffects>whoever opens the Pisces case</textEffects>, believing it to be the Gemini case... ...must be the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!
</line><line>Kate:
!
</line><line>Courtney:
What...!
</line><line>Kay:
B-But that means...! That person is... the true culprit...?
</line><line>Courtney:

</line><line>Courtney:
Please wait a moment, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Do you realize what you're saying? Do you intend to accuse that person of being the culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ms. Hall was trying to trap the true culprit... If so, wouldn't the person who feel for the trap, be the true culprit? However... I have no evidence to back up my claims. If I make a formal accusation without any proof, it will not end well. Should I announce the true killer of Isaac Dover...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What I should do is reveal "<span style="color:#E16935">the truth</textEffects>." In that case... there is no need to hesitate!)</span> ...Yes, that's correct. Judge Courtney. <textEffects>I indict this person as the true culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
Dane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?
</line><line>Delicia:
G-Gusty is...!
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Gustavia...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. Didn't you believe, that if you opened this gallery, the true culprit would come? That's why... you set up the poison gas trap, is it not?
</line><line>Kate:
...You truly have... a gifted mind, just like your father. It is as you say, Monsieur Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Now, would you please tell us the whole truth?
</line><line>Kate:
Yes... I have nothing more to hide. I will... tell you everything. I set a trap in the gallery to find the true culprit. Before the gallery opened... I left only the Autumn Palace unlocked. At opening time, when I went around to unlock each room... I discovered that the Autumn Palace had been locked from the inside. I knew that the true culprit was on the other side of the door. My hand was... t-trembling...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...All that was left was for the trap do its work...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
When I heard Monsieur Gustavia was exposed to the poison gas, I realized he was the culprit. And, I thought that if the police discovered Monsieur Dover's body... ...it would prove Monsieur Master's innocence.
</line><line>Ray:
...Why didn't you ever come talk to me...? There might have been another way!
</line><line>Kate:
I know that you did everything you could for me over the past 18 years. However... all of this had been brought on by my own crime... That's why I wanted to save Monsieur Master as soon as possible...!
</line><line>Ray:
Kate...
</line><line>Kate:
Not only that, the police hid the fact that the body went missing 18 years ago. Even if I reported the body, there was a chance that the truth would be hidden again. That's why I caused the incident at the museum's opening, with as many witnesses as possible.
</line><line>Ray:
.....I'm sorry. Gregory, Mr. Master... And even you... I couldn't protect anyone!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Shields... It must be tough on him as well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kate:
The one who should be apologizing... is me. Monsieur Edgeworth. Monsieur Shields. ...I'm terribly sorry. I shall accept whatever punishment I am given. However, I must ask of you... Please clear Monsieur Master's name!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:

What you did, no matter the reason, was unforgivable.
</line><line>Kate:
Yes, I know.

However, you committed this crime in order to prove Mr. Master's innocence. If the true culprit is someone else, we have a duty to reinvestigate.

No false evidence from the IS-7 Incident remains in the official case files. Moreover, there is no evidence to lend credence to Ms. Hall's testimony. We should first arrest Ms. Hall as the culprit behind today's incident.

We cannot be certain that all the case files are accurate. After all, the prosecutor in the case has a history of... forging evidence.

</line><line>Courtney:
Are you suggesting that the P.I.C. overlooked such a prosecutor...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's none of my concern. The truth is that evidence was falsified. ...And the fact that Dover's body from 18 years ago was just discovered proves it.
</line><line>Courtney:
..... Prosecutor Edgeworth. I can see remnants of Prosecutor von Karma within you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What did you say?
</line><line>Courtney:
You try to deceive the P.I.C. and fabricate the truth! Let me inform you of my... or rather, the P.I.C.'s logic.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- The P.I.C.'s Logic --</textEffects></center>
<line>Courtney:
I acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.
However, he successfully convicted Mr. Master as an accomplice.
I believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.
She even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Is that really... what <textEffects>the P.I.C. believes</textEffects>?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. Every word I utter is for the sake of law and order.

<line>Edgeworth:
There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled. ...Take a look at this.
</line><line>Courtney:
This is...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the forensic results from the Gemini Sculpture that melted in the Winter Palace. According to the results of the analysis, traces of someone's blood were found. Who does this blood belong to...? Until we know the answer, this case is still open!
</line><line>Courtney:
There was blood mixed in with the remains of the Gemini Sculpture...? I heard nothing of this from Sebastian!

This was a report from Detective Gumshoe. ...I had planned to tell Mr. Debeste myself.

I will not avert my eyes from the truth, nor shall I overlook the mistakes of the past.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you wish to report my actions to the P.I.C., be my guest. But in exchange, I want you to let me investigate this case to the very end.

...It is not my place to decide such things. I must ask that you check with Sebastian regarding this matter.

<line>Debeste:
Heeey! Good news, you guys! Thanks to our early detection, Mr. Gustavia's life was saved.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Gustavia...!
</line><line>Kay:
So... he's alive...
</line><line>Gustavia:
Would you be the ones... who saved my life?
</line><line>Ray:
...Hey, Mr. Gustavia.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Hmm? You are... Sir Assistant, are you not!? You've grown so big! This time... this one is your assistant, then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! No. I'm...
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. He's an assistant candidate. And Gregory Edgeworth's son.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph. What a twist of fate...! I am in your debt! It is thanks to you that I have completely recovered.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... There's no need for thanks. Since you're alive, we can reach the truth behind the incident 18 years ago.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Hmm...? What do you speak of?
</line><line>Ray:
While you were unconscious, the truth has started to come to light. You may be Isaac Dover's murderer.
</line><line>Gustavia:
!
</line><line>Debeste:
Whaaat!? Really?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall was looking for the criminal behind the events of 18 years ago. That's why... she set up the poison gas in the Pisces case.
</line><line>Gustavia:
.....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Gustavia. The events of the incident 18 years ago... Tell us what really happened.
</line><line>Gustavia:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So you wish to remain silent?
</line><line>Ray:
Nah. I think he's just meditating.
</line><line>Kay:
He can sleep standing up? What a useful skill to have!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Meditation is different from sleeping, though...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Gustavia! Please tell us what you did 18 years ago!
</line><line>Gustavia:
.....Nnph. Nwahahahahaha! I'm the criminal because I fell for the trap...? That's not a very funny joke! I'm a victim, not a culprit!
</line><line>Courtney:
Mr. Gustavia. It has not yet been made clear whether or not you are the criminal. This is only their baseless speculation. Do not concern yourself with the drivel of a prosecutor without jurisdiction.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph...! At least there is one person here who understands.
</line><line>Courtney:
My name is Justine Courtney. I am a judge. If you would like, I would be happy to assist you. Let us show Prosecutor Edgeworth the truth of 18 years ago.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... Understood. I shall prove my innocence to you, Sir Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney... Is that your answer? Do you intend to bury the truth of the IS-7 Incident before it can be brought to light!?
</line><line>Courtney:
...I merely believe in the judgement of the Goddess of Law.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ultimately, those who render judgement are only human. As long as humans control the law, there is no guarantee that every verdict is correct. If you are going to help conceal the truth... I will not hold back!
</line><line>Courtney:
Hmhm... I'm looking forward to it.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Lady Justine. What should I do now?
</line><line>Courtney:
You are being suspected because you set off the poison gas. Can you tell us the reason... ...why you opened the Pisces case?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Understood. I came to see Sir Dover's works from 18 years ago. However, I accidentally entered the museum a half hour before it opened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. There was nobody at the entrance, correct?
</line><line>Kate:
Since I thought the criminal from 18 years ago might be coming... ...I had no security guards in place. I didn't even lock the doors. I was very busy with opening preparations, so there was nobody on the first floor. In addition... I locked every place door aside from the Autumn one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I see. <textEffects>(This must have been done in order to lure the criminal to the Autumn Palace... Which is why he ended up entering the Autumn Palace.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
It's already suspicious that he snuck into the museum in the first place.
</line><line>Courtney:
The gallery should remain silent. Unless you have evidence that can prove his testimony false, I will not allow any objections.
</line><line>Kay:
G-Gallery!? This isn't even a courtroom...
</line><line>Courtney:
Now then... why did you open the Pisces case?
</line><line>Gustavia:
I wished to view Sir Dover's handiwork up close. The Gemini Sculpture... No, it was actually the Pisces, wasn't it? The lid had been frozen shut, so I borrowed a burner to open it... ...but as soon as I opened the lid, poison gas began pouring out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's quite a... convenient testimony.
</line><line>Kay:
It sounds like a total lie, doesn't it...?
</line><line>Courtney:
There are parts of Mr. Gustavia's testimony that I have issues with, as well. However... there is no evidence to disprove it.
</line><line>Kay:
B-But that's...!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Would it not make sense for suspicion to fall on Lady Katherine before myself? She may have intended to release the poison gas haphazardly.
</line><line>Ray:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ray:
Kate turned on the sprinklers as soon as the gas was released. She was specifically targeting the person who triggered the trap. ...Mr. Gustavia. You were her only target.
</line><line>Gustavia:
You... You are willing to accept the words of this criminal as the truth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall must atone for her crimes. However... the same can be said for the criminal from 18 years ago.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Sir Prosecutor, it seems you wish to suspect me to the bitter end. However, I had no reason to murder Sir Dover. If there is no evidence to suggest that I killed him, you cannot suspect me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Can't you prove that Mr. Gustavia is the criminal?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All we know for sure is that Mr. Gustavia fell victim to the poison gas... No matter how strange his behavior was, it won't prove he committed the murder.
</line><line>Kay:
But that's...! Mr. Shields, is there nothing we can do?
</line><line>Ray:
Well... if there isn't any evidence, we should try reorganizing the facts. If Mr. Gustavia was the one who killed Mr. Dover, there must have been a motive.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Motive for the murder - Gustavia claims he has no motive to murder Dover...">Motive</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Motive for the murder - Gustavia claims he has no motive to murder Dover...)</textEffects></span>... Mr. Gustavia himself is denying that such a motive exists.
</line><line>Ray:
...It's not easy to take another person's life. 18 years ago, your old man also discussed motive with Prosecutor von Karma...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
You claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Partnership turned sour - Gustavia helped Dover with his finals dessert, but Dover didn&#39;t help.">relationship had turned sour</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Partnership turned sour - Gustavia helped Dover with his finals dessert, but Dover didn't help.)</textEffects></span>... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
We couldn't talk with Mr. Gustavia 18 years ago... but this time things are different. If we connect everything we've learned so far, the truth might be revealed...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... I suppose so. <textEffects>(It seems I must re-examine the information from 18 years ago. I must recall all the details that have remained unexplained!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Badd:
So... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... Was your doing?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Delicia denied leaving the fingermarks on the frame. If they were left by Mr. Gustavia... ...he may have been trying to view the <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Was Angel&#39;s Recipe his goal? - Was Gustavia&#39;s goal to view the Angel&#39;s Recipe?">Angel's Recipe</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Was Angel's Recipe his goal? - Was Gustavia's goal to view the Angel's Recipe?)</textEffects></span>.)</span>

<line>Kate:
Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...
</line><line>Gregory:
There wasn't enough film?
</line><line>Kate:
It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Remaining film - The amount of film in the camera decreased.

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The information my father collected 18 years ago was certainly not for naught... If there is no evidence, then I shall use logic to reveal the truth!)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia. You collaborated with the victim, Isaac Dover, to create your desserts, didn't you?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Oh...? It seems you know about my secret.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields told me about it. Mr. Dover handled the design, while you were in charge of the taste. Is that correct?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Ngh... Back then my training had been insufficient.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems you worked together through the semifinals, but not during the finals. Why is that?
</line><line>Gustavia:
We both wished to compete in the finals against Sir Master on our own merits...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You must have also helped with Isaac Dover's dessert even during the finals!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... What makes you able to declare something like that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Didn't you tell Prosecutor von Karma about it yourself, 18 years ago? ...That you "cooperated until the day before the finals"?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of <textEffects>sherbet</textEffects>. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be <textEffects>left overnight to freeze</textEffects>. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!
</line><line>von Karma:
......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.
</line><line>Gregory:
Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?
</line><line>von Karma:

</line><line>von Karma:
...The views of the dead are of no concern to me.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Why did Isaac Dover not help you in return?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Ngh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If there is a reason why your partnership with Isaac Dover broke down... ...that would be a motive for murder!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Mmmmph...! That could be a possibility. However! Sir Dover and I ended our partnership peacefully!
</line><line>Kay:
A peaceful breakup? ...That's hard to imagine.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Not to mention, it's absurd to think that I killed Sir Dover in Sir Master's room! I <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Timing of Dover&#39;s murder - Gustavia could not have murdered Dover while Master was in the room.">couldn't have killed Sir Dover</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Timing of Dover's murder - Gustavia could not have murdered Dover while Master was in the room.)</textEffects></span> while Sir Master was also there, making his desserts. In other words, there is no way I could have committed the murder.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...That's not true. If there was a moment when Mr. Master was absent from the room... ...I could prove that it was possible for Mr. Gustavia to commit the murder!)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
If he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it. Perhaps Mr. Gustavia used Mr. Master's camera to take the pictures.
</line><line>Kay:
If he had stolen the actual recipe book, the police would've found out!
</line><line>Ray:
I see... Pictures, eh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The problem is the time at which he entered Mr. Master's room...
</line><line>Ray:
...Mr. Gustavia could've moved around freely during the afternoon tea, right? Because it seems both him and Mr. Dover <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Afternoon tea - Dover and Gustavia did not participate in the afternoon tea.">did not participate in the afternoon tea</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Afternoon tea - Dover and Gustavia did not participate in the afternoon tea.)</textEffects></span>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If I remember correctly, the only time we can prove that Dover was still alive is...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
The victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
Were Master's desserts all that you ate?
</line><line>Delicia:
...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(After the contest began, Isaac Dover was locked up in his room. If we assume he was killed at some point before Delicia snuck into his room... ...then there is a high chance that he was killed before the afternoon tea was over.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began. Ergo, that is the only time when Gustavia could have killed Dover.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you satisfied?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Sorry, but I am far from satisfied. Because I am finally starting to see... the truth behind this case!
</line><line>Courtney:
Are you saying you have found some evidence to show us that truth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... There is no need to present my evidence. Since we can just have Mr. Gustavia tell us the truth.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! So this is where you use "that", right!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. ...Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me.
</line><line>Gustavia:
........................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I said... Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnghhoooh! Wh-What is it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
During the finals of the contest, you made your desserts on your own.
</line><line>Gustavia:
I wanted to compete for the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef on my own merits.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If that was truly the case, you would have competed on your own merits from the start. I want you to tell me why it was necessary for you to cooperate with Isaac Dover.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
During the contest 18 years ago, Mr. Gustavia collaborated with Mr. Dover. I wonder... What made them decide to cooperate in the first place? That's what I need to draw out from him, but...
</line><line>Gustavia:
......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm... It seems he <span style="color:#E16935">pretends to meditate</textEffects> when things aren't going his way...)</span> First, I'll ask about <textEffects>why he collaborated with Mr. Dover</textEffects>. The truth has been hidden for 18 years... That ends today!
</line>
<center><textEffects>Begin Logic Chess</textEffects></center>

<line>Edgeworth:
Why did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Sir Dover and I were already acquaintances, even before the contest began. Since he was interested in the contest, we simply decided to enter it together.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Joining forces with a sculptor. You weren't confident in your own abilities?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph...! You know nothing about me! We wanted to make great works together!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Gustavia:
Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school. We all got along well from the start.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Really? So were you going to share the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef together?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph...... ......

<line>Edgeworth:
Heh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way. Mr. Dover was a sculptor... I doubt he had any interest in the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. In that case, where did his true goal lie?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Gustavia:
Nn... Nnph...! Indeed... my goal was the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. However, Sir Dover's goal was the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. You cooperated because your interests were aligned. But there must have been a reason why your partnership soured.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Sir Prosecutor, I am the victim of a poisoning. If you're going to suspect me in this manner... Perhaps I'd better return to the infirmary!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-Wait a moment!
</line><line>Gustavia:
In that case, you should end things soon. ...I am not a patient man.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It seems he's trying to leave. I can't let that happen. He's still hiding something. Next, I should ask him about his <textEffects>true goal</textEffects>. I need to keep the pressure on him, while being cautious of the time!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Didn't you have another goal besides the title? The title alone doesn't seem to have much value.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnnnpphh...! How dare the likes of you insult the title of a confectionery artist! My only goal was the "title" itself! I had no interest in anything else! My dream was to become the world's greatest pastry chef!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Gustavia:
18 years ago, I was lacking in design sense. However, things are different now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? Are you saying you have improved at your craft?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Exactly! For I have trained at the Republic of Zheng Fa!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Gustavia:
Yes, yes. At the time, I also studied Mr. Master's works. I would often watch his show with my son.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you were studying Mr. Master's work to improve your own skills. If you had his recipes, perhaps it would've been easier for you to become the world's greatest.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... Perhaps. To a pastry chef, Sir Master's recipes were worth their weight in gold... ......
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Heh... If becoming the world's greatest pastry chef was your goal... ...you should have also been interested in the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Gustavia:
Nnnnnngghh! The recipes of the world's greatest pastry chef... I would be lying if I said that I wasn't interested...! However... I wouldn't think that simply being interested would be a problem!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I wonder about that. <textEffects>(The Angel's Recipe's true nature was not for making desserts, but cures. And all of the contest participants should have been aware of that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Nnggrrrrrr...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Looks like I'm getting close. He isn't meditating any more. Now to slowly but surely drive him into a corner. Next, I'll ask what he <textEffects>planned to use the recipe book for</textEffects>!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
You seem to know quite a lot about the Angel's Recipe.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... It was explained to all the contest participants at the beginning of the contest.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... In that case, you must know about the recipe's true nature. That it was not a recipe book for desserts at all!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnnnnngghh! Impressive, Sir Prosecutor... So you know the true nature of the Angel's Recipe. The Angel's Recipe... Some have called it the "Ultimate Recipe Book." It contained formulas for new medicines that were not yet on the market!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He knew the <textEffects>recipes were actually formulas for new medicines</textEffects>. This could be a useful <textEffects>clue</textEffects>.
</line><line><i>Leads back to first</i>

<line>Edgeworth:
Looks like that <textEffects>clue</textEffects> will come in handy.

<line>Edgeworth:
You may have studied design in Zheng Fa... ...however, your skills in lying could use more work. You just said earlier... that the Angel's Recipe contained formulas for medicines!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nn... Nnnnnnnngghhh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You weren't interested in desserts. You wanted the medicine formulas!
</line><line>Gustavia:
......
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Now, why would a pastry chef such as yourself be so interested in medicine...? Perhaps what you were really after was the information about the new medicine?
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Gustavia:
Nnghhoooh! Nngh... I've underestimated you, Sir Prosecutor... Yes... my goal was more than just the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef! At the time, my son was ill... I needed the recipe for the medicine!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your son was ill...? Tell me more about that.
</line><line>Gustavia:
.....To protect my son's honor, I can say no more.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm. Judging by the <span style="color:#E16935">worried</textEffects> look on his face, I must have struck a nerve.)</span> Next, I need him to tell me more about <textEffects>his son's illness</textEffects>. This is it! This will be my final move of the game!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Looks like that <textEffects>clue</textEffects> will come in handy.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You told me your son's illness was not life-threatening. Is there really a need to be so secretive about it?
</line><line>Gustavia:
...... It was enough to keep him from living a normal life...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That... must have been difficult for your son.
</line><line>Gustavia:
I tried everything I could to cure his illness... It wasn't fair for the poor boy. He could never taste the desserts he loved so much... ......
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness. A remedy that could also cure Mr. Master's "taste disorder."
</line><line>Gustavia:
! What...! He had it too!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He had it "too"... I see... So your son suffers from a taste disorder?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnghoo! I didn't think you'd figure it out so quickly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In order to cure your son's taste disorder, you needed the recipe book... Wasn't that your true goal?
</line><line>Gustavia:
...... Nnph. It is as you say.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Based on how he's acted up until now, it appears he is still hiding something.

Until the semifinals, my son would always drop by the contest venue to play.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is that so? Wouldn't he get in your way? I doubt you had time to care for your son while you were challenging Mr. Master!
</line><line>Gustavia:
...That may be so... but I wanted to grant my son's wish. He said he always wanted to be the first to eat my desserts...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
About your son... If he was so sick, wouldn't it be difficult for him to come and play with you?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph...! My son's illness... it wasn't life-threatening...

<line>Edgeworth:
You just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works. In addition, if your goal was to win the contest in order to get the medicine formula... ...you must have been curious about the other contestants' entries as well!
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Nn... Nmmph. There was time to sample the other desserts during the contest, but... ...none of their entries... had any flavor, so I didn't want to eat any of it. I suspect... I may have been a bit nervous as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

<line>Edgeworth:

<line>Edgeworth:
Being unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness. That reminds me... didn't you say something similar earlier? "None of their entries had any flavor, so I didn't feel like eating any of it", wasn't it? Perhaps, your son wasn't the only one who suffered from a taste disorder.
</line><line>Gustavia:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's hard to imagine being a successful pastry chef without a sense of taste. Perhaps what you really wanted was to cure yourself?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnngghh... That's completely ludicrous... 18 years ago, I made those desserts all by myself...!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction. Didn't you cooperate with Isaac Dover in the contest!? You can hardly say you made the desserts "all by yourself"!
</line>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Gustavia:
Nngh... NNGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You must take great pride in your abilities as a pastry chef. But to betray your pride and cooperate with another contestant... ...you did it all to cure your own disease!
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Well done, Sir Prosecutor. It's as you say... The one with the taste disorder is not my son... ...It is I. No one knew... I've kept it a secret for 18 years...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter how long a secret is kept. If you lie before me, I will expose it. Dane Gustavia and Isaac Dover were both trying to obtain the recipes for the new medicines. Gustavia to cure his condition, and Dover most likely to sell the recipe book for money... For this reason, they entered the contest as a collaborative effort. And with that... Checkmate.

<line>Gustavia:
Nnnnnnnnngh...! I have never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a <textEffects>taste disorder</textEffects> 18 years ago.
</line><line>Kay:
Taste disorder...?
</line><line>Gustavia:
It was a severe disorder. I was unable to discern any flavor at all... It's the one illness a pastry chef dreads above all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Those symptoms sound a bit different from Mr. Master's taste disorder...
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Master's condition is known as "<textEffects>hypoguesia</textEffects>." It simply causes a decreased sensitivity to certain specific flavors.
</line><line>Gustavia:
I'm sure it has caused Sir Master much pain too. After all, no medication was available to cure it 18 years ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In order to cure your taste disorder, you would need Mr. Master's Angel's Recipe... ...and that's why you entered the contest, am I correct?
</line><line>Gustavia:
That was one of my goals, but I still had my sights set on the title of World's Greatest. When it comes to making desserts, I won't lose to anyone! Even without the ability to taste, I still have the utmost confidence in my flavors!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? So, I presume you also prepared your dessert in the finals with the intent to win?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph... That goes without saying.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(According to what Mr. Shields told us earlier, the evaluation of Mr. Gustavia's entry was...)</textEffects>

Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
It seems the dessert you made for the finals was not rated highly in regards to flavor.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nmmmph..............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Gustavia! You will tell us about how you made your dessert during the finals.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Very well...! It seems I must teach you upstarts a lesson!

Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.
However, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.
I helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.
If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gustavia:
How about that, Sir Prosecutor. This is the truth of 18 years ago!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh... I can't find any contradictions in his testimony...!
</line><line>Ray:
Well, of course he isn't going to fess up that easily. This gun's been on the run for 18 years, after all. Guess we'll just have to keep on pressing him until he breaks, eh?

<line>Edgeworth:
There was another difference between the semifinals and finals. This photo depicts your son... We know he came to visit you up until the finals.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnph. That is correct... What does that have to do with anything?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your son, who always came to see you through the semifinals, was not present for the finals. And then, it was only in the finals that your flavor judged poorly. I don't believe this to be a mere coincidence. Your son's visits must have been very important to you, were they not?
</line><line>Gustavia:
...A father can work miracles when his son is watching. With my son cheering me on, I was able to make the most delicious desserts.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Gustavia sure sounds like a good father, doesn't he...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If what he's saying is the whole truth, one could say so... ...but just hearing his son's cheers wouldn't be enough to change the taste of his desserts. <textEffects>(...A confectioner, confident in his sense of taste, develops a taste disorder. It would have been difficult for him to maintain the taste of his desserts.)</textEffects> Your son came to cheer you on. ...Was that really all he did?
</line><line>Gustavia:
...You seem very doubtful, Sir Prosecutor. In that case, I'll turn this around and ask you! What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure your elementary school son would have remembered the taste of your desserts.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Of course! My son always loved my desserts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, he would have been able to taste test your desserts in your place.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nngh... Wh-What did you say...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Earlier, you told us that you have a taste disorder...

No one else knew about your taste disorder. If Mr. Dover had found out, he would have ended your partnership. After all, you were in charge of the flavor.
</line><line>Gustavia:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your son didn't just cheer you on! He also helped you determine if your desserts tasted correct!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nngh... Nnguoooooooh!

Ah, I see... Mr. Dover's dessert was made the day before, so it still tasted good.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nwahahahaha!
</line><line>Ray:

</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Gustavia:
What are you saying is quite amusing, Sir Prosecutor! You say that my elementary school son assisted me as a taste tester!? ...You are insulting my pride.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your pride...?
</line><line>Gustavia:
It's true, I had no sense of design 18 years ago. However, I won't lose to anyone when it comes to flavor! You claim I would cast aside my pride and rely on my son...? Don't get carried away with your foolish conjecture... you upstart.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh... In that case, I'm sure your son can confirm if my theory is mere conjecture!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nwahahaha! Unfortunately for you... I no longer have a son!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh... What!?
</line><line>Gustavia:
After my taste disorder was cured, I went to train in Zheng Fa immediately. ...During that time, I severed all ties with my son!
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't tell me...! You would even abandon your own son!?
</line><line>Ray:
That's not all... Even today, the whereabouts of his son are still unknown. The police have been searching, but they haven't been able to find any traces of him.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...You wish to confirm your theory? I welcome you to try. Nwahahahahaha! Desserts are the only things that are important to me! After regaining my sense of taste, my son no longer mattered!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Order in the court. Mr. Gustavia's actions are certainly inhumane. However... we are not here to judge whether or not he is a good father. Prosecutor Edgeworth. I believe this is your loss.
</line><line>Gustavia:
After all, there is no evidence left from 18 years ago that could prove your theories!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing we can do! At this rate... we'll never find out the truth!

Hmm.....! <textEffects>(Detective Gumshoe... Where are those results...!?)</textEffects>

<textEffects>Right. I leave it to you, Detective.</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I entrusted Detective Gumshoe with the last piece of evidence. If only I knew who that blood belonged to...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Miles... there's still one thing that's bothering Uncle Ray. Was Mr. Gustavia's only reason for coming to the art gallery to check on the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..... If he only wanted to confirm the body's presence, he wouldn't have needed to open the case.
</line><line>Ray:
That's right... Is there a way we can prove this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is one way. We just need that evidence from Detective Gumshoe...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What are you talking about?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting, siiir!
</line><line>Courtney:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... Just the person I was talking about. Detective Gumshoe. I trust you have the test results?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Of course, sir! I just got the report back from the lab!
</line><line>Courtney:
Detective... Please be silent. So, this is the evidence that Prosecutor Edgeworth was talking about...
</line><line>Debeste:
Huh? Hey, what's this...? This is the first I've heard of it!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Errrrm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This was a request from me. I asked him to investigate a certain piece of evidence.
</line><line>Debeste:
Why... Why is everyone always helping you out!? I'm the one in charge of the crime scene!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Debeste. I apologize for taking matters into my own hands, but how about we hear his report first?
</line><line>Debeste:
...Uh, sure...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. What were the results?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Here's the report, sir! The traces of blood found in the Gemini Sculpture belong to... ...the victim of the poison gas, Dane Gustavia!
</line><line>Gustavia:
...What are you saying?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Good work, Detective Gumshoe. As I thought... my theory was correct.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What do you mean?
</line><line>Courtney:
We, too, would like an explanation. What on earth does this blood prove!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This blood... is something the culprit of the IS-7 Incident tried to conceal.
</line><line>Gustavia:
! I-It can't be... That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...This blood was found inside the glass case of the Gemini Sculpture. In other words, your blood was found alongside Mr. Dover's body!
</line><line>Gustavia:

</line><line>Courtney:
Wh... Why would Mr. Gustavia's blood be in a place like that!?
</line><line>Gustavia:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you intend to remain silent, then I'll reveal the truth myself. In the Gemini case, aside from the blood, we also found traces of salt and sugar.
</line><line>Courtney:
Salt and blood...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And only one of Mr. Dover's sherbet desserts tasted salty.
</line><line>Ray:
Come to think of it... I remember Ms. Delicious saying the same thing 18 years ago.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Delicia:
Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!
</line><line>Ray:
Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.
</line><line>Delicia:
But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.
</line><line>Gregory:
Salty...?
</line><line>Delicia:
It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.
</line><line>Gregory:
That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Exactly... For some reason, salt bad been mixed into the lyre. No other traces of salt were found in Dover's room.
</line><line>Courtney:
In that case... Please explain. <textEffects>Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe part of this rock salt lamp was mixed in with the sherbet from the lyre. At the time of the murder, there were two rock salt lamps in Mr. Master's room. One of those lamps took Mr. Dover's life. We know that Mr. Dover's blood was left behind on the murderous lamp, however... ...there were no traces of anyone's blood found at the crime scene, Mr. Master's room.
</line><line>Ray:
Because the killer disposed all of the desserts with traces of blood into the streams of water, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No other traces of salt were found in Mr. Dover's room.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnngh.....!
</line><line>Ray:
Speaking of which... Weren't the two rock salt lamps found in Ms. Delicious' room also broken?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gregory:
It looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.
</line><line>Badd:
Both of their light bulbs... are broken...
</line><line>Ray:
Maybe they were dropped on the floor.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
We never did figure out why the other rock salt lamp was broken... Maybe Mr. Gustavia's blood was on the other lamp!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnnnngghh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If your blood was found on the lamps at the crime scene, you would have been suspected. As the culprit, you would have needed to conceal all traces of your blood from the police.
</line><line>Courtney:
Don't tell me he concealed it in the sherbet lyre...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Exactly. The rock salt lamp and his blood were mixed into the sherbet lyre and hidden inside the glass case. Unlike the fountain's water, the sherbet desserts would not be analyzed right away. Perhaps he had planned to dispose of the sherbet when the opportunity presented itself?
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-Then... the reason Mr. Gustavia came to this gallery...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...18 years ago, the body and the evidence pointing to the killer were both stolen. Even the killer could not have anticipated that. There was no way of knowing when the body and the evidence would be discovered.
</line><line>Ray:
So he planned to destroy the evidence before the Zodiac Art Gallery's grand opening.
</line><line>Gustavia:
....................
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Dane Gustavia... isn't it about time you confessed? You are the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!

Mr. Gustavia...
</line><line>Gustavia:
Could it be...? After all this time my crime is finally brought to light! The prosecutors and defense attorneys 18 years ago never even came close. Bravo, bravo! Well done, Sir Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So you admit that you killed Mr. Dover?
</line><line>Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHA! It is true. I killed Isaac Dover! But, he had only himself to blame...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Dover and I worked together in order to win the contest. No matter who won, we agreed that we'd share the Angel's Recipe. But, on the day of the finals, he stabbed me in the back!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gustavia:
Sir Dover! This isn't what we agreed to!
</line><line>Dover:
I'm sorry Gustavia. ...The deal is off.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Wha...! But I made your desserts for you! I'm the reason you got this far!
</line><line>Dover:
...And what of it? Can you prove that you assisted me in any way?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Dover, you...! You were planning to betray me all along...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gustavia:
Because of Dover's treachery, I was forced to make my finals entry on my own. It's just as Sir Prosecutor said, my son assisted me every day until the finals.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What about your "pride" as a confectionery artist?
</line><line>Gustavia:
A proud chef loses the ability to taste his own creations... That's a feeling an upstart like you would never understand! Mastering the art of dessert making is my reason for being! It is my one and only pride!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Committing murder for the sake of pride. That's another feeling I will never understand. To say nothing of abandoning your own son... such a thought disgusts me.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Before you judge me, first understand what happened 18 years ago. On the day of the finals, my son never came to assist me. Thinking back on it now, I suppose Dover had a hand in that as well.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh...? What exactly happened to your son?
</line><line>Gustavia:
I do not know. But it no longer matters. Ever since that day, my son meant nothing to me. From what I hear, he's still missing.
</line><line>Kay:
Th... That's awful! Giving up on him like that...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Without your son, you had no chance of winning... Correct?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Yes. And since I was guaranteed to lose, I needed a fail-safe. During the afternoon tea time, I made my way to Sir Master's room... I just needed to take a photo of the cure to my taste disorder. It would have all worked out. ...If only Dover hadn't interfered!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Dover:
Ah, Gustavia... Trying to steal a picture of my prize are you? That hardly seems sporting...
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Y-You!
</line><line>Dover:
"Cure for taste disorders"...? Oho. You have... a taste disorder, don't you? Ah, this is rich! A pastry chef who can't taste!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Dover! You...! Gaah...!
</line><line>Dover:
Puny worm... You are in no position to oppose me.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Why you...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gustavia:
When I attempted to hit Dover, he struck me and sent me flying. I crashed into one of the rock salt lamps, and that was when my blood stained on it.
</line><line>Kay:
So Mr. Dover wasn't the first one to be injured...
</line><line>Gustavia:
To conceal my blood, I shaved away part of the rock salt lamp and mixed it into the sherbet. After that, it became a part of the lyre sculpture!
</line><line>Ray:
So... that's how you tried to erase your traces from the crime scene!
</line><line>Gustavia:
...Dover tried to blackmail me by using his knowledge of my taste disorder. If I didn't want it to become public, I was to pay him a large sum.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So... that's the reason why you killed Isaac Dover!?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nwahahaha! Exactly! What reason do I have to let those who obstruct me live? He was the one who drew first blood. I simply gave him his just desserts.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So that was his motive...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gustavia:
I carried the rock salt lamp that bore my blood into Dover's room. Then I came up with a hiding place where it would not be easily found.
</line><line>Ray:
...I get it. That room contained plenty of tools for sculpting sherbet.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Your deduction was spot on, Sir Attorney. It was the ideal place to shave away the rock salt. I then proceeded to coat the surface of the sherbet lyre with vast amounts of the salty mixture.
</line><line>Kate:
But why...? Why did you try to pin the crime on Monsieur Master!?
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Gustavia:
You are wrong to blame me for that, Lady Katherine. If not for your unnecessary meddling, Sir Master would never have been a suspect.
</line><line>Kate:
.....!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Why do you think I hid the murder weapon and fluorescent cloth in Lady Delicia's room?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...There is only one reason why you'd place a murder weapon in someone else's room. You wanted to pin the crime on Delicia.
</line><line>Delicia:
Eeeeeep! M-Me...?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Yes... That is correct.
</line><line>Delicia:
G-Gusty! Why... Why me?
</line><line>Gustavia:
As one who sought to be the world's best confectioner, I greatly respected Sir Master. It was never my intention to cast suspicion on him. But, an insolent woman who dared to sully the contest with fake desserts... I had no problem letting someone like you take the blame for the crime!
</line><line>Delicia:
Th-That's...! That makes me sad!
</line><line>Gustavia:
If you hadn't snacked on other people's desserts, the body would never have been found. It was when Sir Master would be judging Lady Delicia's room... That's when I finally saw an opportunity to freeze the body, but... ...before I could move the body, Lady Katherine had already discovered it...!
</line><line>Kate:
Why... did you need to freeze Monsieur Dover's body...?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Why indeed...?
</line><line>Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us! Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
</line><line>Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct. Preparations were necessary to freeze the body. While I was preparing in Dover's room... ...I placed the body in the treasure chest in Sir Master's room. I could think of no better hiding place at the time... ...but thanks to that gluttonous pharmacist, the lid of the chest broke!
</line><line>Kay:
But why did you disguise him as an ice sculpture?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Once the body was discovered, there would be no time to throw off the time of death. To buy time, you needed to hide it some place else.
</line><line>Kate:
How horrid...! How could you hide Monsieur Dover's body within one of his own works!?
</line><line>Gustavia:
It all would have worked out if the body hadn't been discovered while it was in Sir Master's room. If everything had gone according to plan, Sir Master would have been arrested.
</line><line>Kate:
So... because I... discovered the body...? It's my fault Monsieur Master was...!
</line><line>Ray:
Kate... don't take his words to heart. Even if suspicion hadn't fallen on Mr. Master, Ms. Delicious would have taken the fail. No matter who he targeted, the one at fault here... is Mr. Gustavia himself.
</line><line>Gustavia:
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also a dunce. To think that he never reported the missing body to the prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Prosecutor von Karma indicted Mr. Master without knowing the body had vanished...?
</line><line>Ray:
I see. That would explain why he looked so flustered at the crime scene. Although... It's something that would stand out if you read the official documents.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Could someone have intentionally distorted the information...?)</textEffects> At any rate, Von Karma found out about the missing body after he had made his indictment. And if he had let one person be acquitted, he'd have a stain on his much-prided perfect record. That's why he concealed the fact that the body was hidden, and had Mr. Master declared guilty...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Wh-What are you saying...!?
</line><line>Kay:
For 18 years, that man has taken the blame for your crimes... Don't you feel anything at all?
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nwahahah... I don't care what you say.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What a monster! I'm arresting him right here, right now, sir!
</line><line>Courtney:
...I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that will be impossible.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....!
</line><line>Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So, you've figured it out! That's right... You have no right to sentence me!
</line><line>Kay:
W... WHAT!? But the culprit is standing right in front of us!
</line><line>Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHA! Allow me to tell you the reason why you can't arrest me!

<center><textEffects>-- Why You Can't Arrest Me --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gustavia:
It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.
The statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?
In other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!
I only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
The statue of limitations for murder... is 15 years...! Mr. Edgeworth... Is there nothing we can do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Ngh...! As long as the statute of limitations remains, arresting him is impossible...!
</line><line>Kay:
No way...!
</line><line>Courtney:
...My sincerest apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Neither Mr. Gustavia's testimony nor your logic... can be taken as official legal proof. The verdict of the trial 18 years ago cannot be overturned.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha...! What about the fact that Mr. Dover's body was hidden? Even if we can't arrest Mr. Gustavia, this should at least earn Mr. Master a retrial!
</line><line>Courtney:
Really? I wonder about that. Overturning a verdict of the Goddess of Law... is much harder than you think.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is the P.I.C. trying to justify the verdict from 18 years ago...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nwahahahahahahaha! How unfortunate, Sir Prosecutor!

<line>Edgeworth:
...I can see how he was able to escape justice for 18 years.
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't there some way we can catch him!?
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Gustavia is an amateur at law, after all. He's no match for a real ace attorney. ...I'm sure there's some flaw in his plan that we can exploit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...An amateur at law, huh...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
One of the conditions regarding the statute of limitations for murder is as follows: "<textEffects>If the suspect flees to a foreign country, the time limit is on hold until the suspect returns.</textEffects>" So the statute of limitations was suspended while you were overseas!
</line><line>Gustavia:
......
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! The statute of limitations stopped while you were training in Zheng Fa!
</line><line>Courtney:
Indeed... it is possible that the statute of limitations has not expired yet. Mr. Gustavia. Please tell us how long you stayed in Zheng Fa.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nn... Nnph... It would be... <textEffects>exactly 3 years</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ray:
<textEffects>3 years</textEffects>! Wait... L-Let's calmly think this over. The case occurred 18 years ago... The statute of limitations is 15 years, and he was away for 3.
</line><line>Kay:
15 plus 3 is... exactly 18 years! I-I'm sure of it! Mr. Edgeworth, we did it! The statute of limitations hasn't expired yet!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Nnn... Nnnph... Nnnnnnngghh! Nmmmmmmmmmm... Nwahahahahahahaha! Exactly 18 years, you say! How amusing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh... So, he realized...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Wh-Why are you laughing!? The statute of limitations still applies!
</line><line>Ray:
Kay... it's frustrating, but... ...the case occurred in December. It's April now, which means... ...strictly speaking, the case occurred 18 years and 4 months ago. His stay abroad wasn't quite enough... We were just a few months short...!
</line><line>Kay:
Not enough...! That's... That's...!
</line><line>Gustavia:
Like I said! It's impossible for you to arrest me! Nwahahahahahahaha!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He must have known all about this when he confessed to his crime...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. It really is a shame. If it was just one year earlier... The statute of limitations would not have run out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes. It seems you were simply incapable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Ray:
If you're thinking of taking matters into your own hands, I implore you to reconsider. There still... might be a way to bring this man to justice.
</line><line>Kate:
What...?
</line><line>Ray:
...Miles. Remember the facts of the case 18 years ago. Just as you were mistaken earlier, it seems Mr. Gustavia has also overlooked one key detail.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Overlooked...?
</line><line>Ray:
He wasn't present during Mr. Master's final trial. So he doesn't know the outcome of the trial. ...There may yet be a way for you to arrest him. Miles, look over that book on <textEffects>statute of limitations</textEffects> again. 17 years ago, Master was falsely declared guilty for a serious crime. Thanks to that verdict... we aren't out of ammunition just yet.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! Mr. Shields, you don't mean...!
</line><line>Ray:
"<textEffects>Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes.</textEffects>" I am Mr. Master's attorney. I can't use his suffering as a weapon in good conscience. For that reason... I leave the rest up to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......... <textEffects>(The trial my father and Von Karma battled over, can I use that to arrest Mr. Gustavia!? What should I do... Should I raise an objection?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(My father and Von Karma. Their paths diverged. One revealed the truth, the other concealed it... The path that I choose is... the one that reveals the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Courtney:
I see no further reason to prolong this trial. I hereby find Dane Gustavia "<textEffects>Not Guilty</textEffects>".
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
"<textEffects>Overruled</textEffects>"! Gustavia... will stand in court for his crimes!
</line><line>Courtney:
...Do you mean to say you have found a way to arrest Mr. Gustavia?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Exactly. <textEffects>(I'll show Judge Courtney the evidence that will shatter the statute of limitations!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Courtney:
The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The "Suspect Data" page. At the trial, Jeffery Master was found guilty of being an "<textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>" to murder... And it took <textEffects>1 year</textEffects> to arrive at this verdict.
</line><line>Courtney:
Right... that is indeed true.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This book lists conditions in which the statute of limitations can be put on hold. The first, as I have said earlier, is "<textEffects>if the suspect flees to a foreign country...</textEffects>" But there's one more... "<textEffects>If possible accomplices are on trial, the countdown is stopped until the verdict is reached.</textEffects>"
</line><line>Gustavia:
Wh... What are you saying!? Sir Master was found to be an <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Ray:
That's right. Mr. Master was sentenced after you had left for your trip to Zheng Fa. And he was found guilty not of being the culprit, but of being an accomplice. ...But it seems you didn't know that.
</line><line>Gustavia:
Th... That's absurd! Sir Master never committed any crime to begin with! You should certainly know this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course we do. That is why we are going to free him. To that end, we will shatter the one remaining obstacle in our way... The statute of limitations!! You fled to Zheng Fa for <textEffects>3 years</textEffects>... And Jeffery Master was being tried as an <textEffects>accomplice</textEffects> for <textEffects>1 year</textEffects>. Put it all together, we see that the total time limit for this case is <textEffects>19 years</textEffects>. In other words... ...the statute of limitations is not over for you yet!
</line><line>Gustavia:
GNNGGHHAAAAAAAAAAHH!
</line><line>Courtney:
The Goddess of Law is unerring in her judgments. However... it seems that the prosecutor at the time was not. I cannot believe it, but it seems like the case will have to be reopened...
</line><line>Gustavia:
This... is absurd...! ...You cannot arrest me...!

</line><line>Kate:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. I can't help but feel that you've been dishonest with me.
</line><line>Courtney:
...Dishonest? Whatever do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You said that "<textEffects>the verdict could not be overturned</textEffects>", but... that was not the case. A reinvestigation and retrial were obviously required as soon as the missing body was found.
</line><line>Courtney:
..... I have no need to answer you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems she doesn't intend to ever give me an answer...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Now then... I shall take my leave.

Mr. Master. Miles is your old defense attorney's son.
</line><line>Master:

</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Master. I came here today to tell you everything we've learned about 18 years ago.
</line><line>Master:
18 years ago...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Master:
Kate committed a crime for my sake? Why would she do such a thing...?
</line><line>Ray:
Ms. Hall has been trying to prove your innocence for the past 18 years. She... was willing to do whatever it took to save you.
</line><line>Master:
Kate... she shouldn't have gone through so much trouble for an old man who let her down...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Master... I don't think you realize just how much Ms. Hall cares for you. I have something here that clearly proves the two of you share an unbreakable bond.
</line><line>Master:
An unbreakable bond...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Proof of the bond between Jeffery Master and Katherine Hall. This should give Mr. Master some peace of mind...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ray:
...Mr. Master. It's looking like we'll be able to get you out soon. I can only apologize that it took 18 years to do so...!
</line><line>Master:
Raymond... I'm the one who should be apologizing. No... That's not it. What I really should be saying is... ...Thank you.
</line><line>Ray:
Mr. Master...
</line><line>Master:
Now it's my turn... to wait for Kate. I'll make her favorite sweets every day until she returns. Please look after her, Raymond.
</line><line>Ray:
...You got it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The IS-7 Incident, the case I inherited from my father... After 18 long years, it's finally coming to a close.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Miles... Thanks for today. I'm sorry for leaving that final decision to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... I made that decision of my own free will.
</line><line>Kay:
Eh? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Ray:
To arrest Gustavia, we had no choice but to use Mr. Master's <textEffects>false charge</textEffects>. To use Mr. Master's false charge, which I was originally supposed to protect him from... The attorney inside of me, simply could not do it.
</line><line>Kay:
So that's how it was...
</line><line>Ray:
But... after this, Uncle Ray is going to try to clear away that false charge as well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... I understand.
</line><line>Kay:
What...? But if they find out about the false charge, they won't be able to arrest Mr. Gustavia, right?
</line><line>Ray:
That's true... It sure is a <textEffects>contradiction in the law</textEffects>. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.
</line><line>Kay:
A contradiction in the law...
</line><line>Ray:
Well. Who knows what'll happen. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. Just like Uncle Ray and Miles have grown up... y'know!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(People and the law... both grow.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
.....Miles. To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....I will.
</line><line>Ray:
Well, if you ask Uncle Ray, you'll always be welcome down at the office. Alrighty then. Looks like it's time for Uncle Ray to get going! Next time I see you, I'll be sure to thank you again. .....Really though, thanks for today.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Shields seemed to be in a bit of a hurry.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Indeed. <textEffects>(I should be the one... thanking him. I was able to face my father's last case because of him.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
When I was young... I wanted to become a great defense attorney like my father. However, under Prosecutor von Karma, I learned the ways of a prosecutor... Thanks to a certain friend, I was able to discover my own path in life. However... Right now, there are forces trying to take me off the prosecutor's path. Maybe now... is the perfect time to think about how I should live my life.

<line>Ray:
...Gregory. I'm sorry... that it took so long. It may have taken 18 years... ...but finally, we've proven Mr. Master's innocence...! Miles, your son... helped me with that. The way he fought for the truth... He was just like you, Gregory. I'm still not the kind of attorney you were... ...but I will forever carry on... the convictions I inherited from you. And if I can... ...together with him.
