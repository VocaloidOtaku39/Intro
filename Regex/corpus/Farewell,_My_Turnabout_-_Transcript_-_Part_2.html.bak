<line>Engarde:
Adrian did it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's what it looks like.
</line><line>Engarde:
Dude, no way! That woman couldn't do anything like that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.
</line><line>Engarde:
A mountain of evidence...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.
</line><line>Engarde:
Please, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm "refreshing like a spring breeze", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I understand...
</line><line>???:
Well, it's almost time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mia...
</line><line>Mia:
We must get a complete acquittal today.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know... I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!
</line><line>Mia:
Indeed. Well, let's get going!
</line>
<center><textEffects>...*beep beep beep*...</textEffects></center>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's him!)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects></center>
<line>Phoenix:
This is Wright!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Good morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya... She's unharmed, right!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Well... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Don't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
G...Grrrr...
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>For myself, you must win today's trial. Which is why... I sent you a little <span style="color:#E16935">present</textEffects> this morning.</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Present? What in the world would you want to give me!?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't "like" my gift... I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest... If you please.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait!
</line>
<center><textEffects>...*beep*...</textEffects></center>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The kidnapper sent me a "present"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Engarde:
Mr. Lawyer dude? Who was that...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!
</line><line>Engarde:
...Dude, did your nose just get longer?
</line>

<center><textEffects>March 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3</textEffects></center>
<line>Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-I don't know, Your Honor! <textEffects>(Why are you getting mad at me!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Bailiff:
...Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Please be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?
</line><line>Bailiff:
Prosecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!
</line><line>Judge:
... WWWWWWWHAT!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sh-Shot!?
</line><line>Mia:
Somehow... I think this is the "present" that man was talking about.
</line><line>Phoenix:
His "present"...!
</line><line>Mia:
Ms. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she disappeared... This would be to your "<textEffects>advantage</textEffects>".
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-This... This is totally insane!)</textEffects> M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?
</line><line>Judge:
I don't have that answer! ...
</line><line>???:
She's alive and in stable condition.
</line><line>Judge:
That's good... Phew. ... ...! Y-Y-You're...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I thought he'd show up...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-The court acknowledges the prosecution.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Witness, your name and occupation.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.
</line><line>Judge:
"For now"...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
After this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(D-Detective Gumshoe...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.
</line><line>Mia:
Get ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  <textEffects>(The answer he was "struggling" for... Interesting... Show me this "answer" you finally found, Edgeworth...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Bare Facts of the Case --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
This murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.
The victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.
After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.
At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.
However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.

</line>

<line>Mia:
Our first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...
</line><line>Mia:
Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you say so...
</line><line>Mia:
Of course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>(Pressing third, fourth and fifth statements leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Why Arrest Engarde? --</textEffects></center>
<line>Gumshoe:
Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.
They each thought the other guy was "in his way". That's motive enough in my book.
As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.
It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama".
The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.
The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.
</line><line><textEffects>Knife added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...And there's this button.
</line><line>Judge:
That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the <textEffects>victim's</textEffects> blood, sir.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line><textEffects>Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
All of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grrrrrrrrr...

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Be grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
We're still in a world of trouble...
</line><line>Mia:
Well, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Wait a second!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
So the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client "bought a knife beforehand"?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. The defendant...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Did not buy this knife.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
H-Huh!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...Huh?
</line><line>Judge:
It has a "<textEffects>Gatewater</textEffects>" seal set into the handle...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
"Gatewater"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Uh oh.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that is very true! This is a very big...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-How so!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The question is... Where did this knife come from?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.
</line><line>Judge:
There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that <textEffects>Mr. Matt Engarde's knife</textEffects> was missing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.
</line><line>Judge:
Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.
</line><line>Mia:
It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This must be one of those "traps", and I just walked headlong into it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Evidence not yet shown...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
He means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
What does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, well...
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
There's one...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
One piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
You may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?
</line>


<line>Judge:
This... is a wine glass, is it not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.
</line><line>Phoenix:
However! This glass that is sitting on top of the dresser is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Well? What do you all have to say...?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!
</line><line>Judge:
You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is it, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Your opinion...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-Then...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Fingerprints...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.
</line><line>Judge:
Only one? Well, whose were they!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAT!?
</line><line><textEffects>Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Grrr!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a "prosecutor". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!
</line><line>Judge:
W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Another witness"...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!
</line><line>Mia:
What in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Now then, witness, please state your name and occupation...
</line><line>Oldbag:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!
</line><line>Ray Gun:
<textEffects>*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Uurrngh!
</line><line>Oldbag:
...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Grrrrrrrrr...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Oldbag:
Oh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
I tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Ms... Witness... "That terrible crime" is all this court needs to know.
</line><line>Ray Gun:
<textEffects>*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Oof!
</line><line>Oldbag:
Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, madam.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.
</line><line>Oldbag:
It's true what they say that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?
</line><line>Oldbag:
It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!
</line><line>Judge:
You mean... You were a fan of the victim?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Um... But those two were the same age...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Oldbag:
Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.
</line><line>Oldbag:
Leave it to me, Edgey-poo!

<line>Oldbag:
Anyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.
There was something I was interested in finding out, you know...
Well, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.
That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.
It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...
</line><line>Oldbag:
See! It has to be him! He's the murderer!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.

<line>Phoenix:
Please tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But it does.
</line><line>Oldbag:
Um... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What thing?
</line><line>Oldbag:
That gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)</textEffects>

That thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, right...
</line><line>Judge:
So, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:

That's bad for us. Really bad.

Aaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!

<textEffects>(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...)</textEffects> This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.
</line><line>Oldbag:
See! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.
</line><line>Oldbag:
See! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his "usual <textEffects>racing jacket</textEffects>"!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!

</line><line>Oldbag:
But when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!
</line><line>Oldbag:
Edgey-poo! Do you think so too?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, it might be something worth thinking about.

Just say, "It's important" and agree with me for a change!

<line>Oldbag:
Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!
The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!
Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.
He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.
So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But... But the possibility does exist!
</line><line>Oldbag:
Ah, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.
</line><line>Judge:
H-How do you know that?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Because... I said so. And what I say is the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Hmm...
</line><line>Mia:
You don't need to think too hard on this one.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Mia:
There's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at this.
</line><line>Oldbag:
Yeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No no, that's not my intention at all...
</line><line>Judge:
That's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?
</line><line>Judge:
You don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's <textEffects>fingerprints</textEffects> are on it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Is that what you're driving at...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That is exactly what I am driving at.
</line><line>Judge:
What are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

He probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!

</line><line>Phoenix:
And why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, there is one possibility!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then let's hear your "possibility"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But the murder still did take place...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, yes... I have heard of that... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you babbling about...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, we did establish that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I suppose...
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, you just said it yourself. "At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder." If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was <textEffects>wearing the costume</textEffects> at the time of the murder... Then there should be <textEffects>glove marks</textEffects> left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!
</line><line>Judge:
O-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!
</line><line>Judge:
To frame...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

But we just established that the witness saw the "Nickel Samurai" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!

</line><line>Oldbag:
... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?

</line><line>Judge:
Witness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Well, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?
</line><line>Oldbag:
But I mean, I can't really do anything about that! Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(She wasn't waiting for the "<span style="color:#E16935">Nickel Samurai</textEffects>"...?)</span> Alright then... <textEffects>Who</textEffects> were you waiting around for then?
</line><line>Oldbag:
... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!
</line><line>Judge:
I have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Ha ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.
</line><line>Judge:
Amateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Maybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for "that" person!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...)</textEffects> Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Who is this person...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The judge seems to be really into the "article"... If it can be called such a thing...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Then this manager with the initials <textEffects>A. A.</textEffects>... Are you saying it's...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Adrian Andrews</textEffects>. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.
</line><line>Oldbag:
... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.
</line><line>Judge:
W-Witness...? What in the world are you...
</line><line>Mia:
Watch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.
</line><line>Oldbag:
I got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But what for...?
</line><line>Oldbag:
Oh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.
</line><line>Judge:
... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this "secret information".
</line><line>Oldbag:
Get ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!

</line><line>Edgeworth:

The "investigative photographer", Lotta Hart...

Oh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.
</line><line>Phoenix:
She reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.
</line><line>Judge:
She reported such a thing...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
On that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Oldbag:
Wh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No no no, I said <textEffects>impressions</textEffects>.

Ah! That's it! That's the note!

Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!

Hmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?
</line><line>Oldbag:
I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! "En garde! I'm his sidekick!" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!

</line><line>Oldbag:
I was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Witness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?
</line><line>Oldbag:
S-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!
</line><line>Oldbag:
Are you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?
</line><line>Judge:
A camera...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, "My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!"
</line><line>Judge:
Why... Why... Witness!!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What is it, gramps?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!
</line><line>Oldbag:
Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, that's...!
</line><line>Oldbag:
What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and "borrow" things from people!
</line><line>Judge:
Um... I think your definition of "borrow" is a little off...
</line><line>Oldbag:
I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, "Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.
</line><line>Judge:
Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!
</line><line>Oldbag:
See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!
</line><line>Judge:

</line><line><textEffects>Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was <textEffects>still in his Nickel Samurai costume</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The defendant.
</line><line>Judge:
How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!)</textEffects> This photo that Lotta took... There's...

<line>Phoenix:
There's... There's something strange with this photo!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I knew this was coming, Wright.
</line><line>Judge:
Your thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.
</line><line>Judge:
"Debunk with a bunker buster"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!
</line><line>Judge:
If you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need <textEffects>one chance</textEffects>, correct...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... Well... <textEffects>(I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...? It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, let's hear your objection. <textEffects>What about this photo is "strange"...?</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.
</line><line>Judge:
A-And...? What does that mean...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The "Nickel Samurai" in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!
</line><line>Judge:
What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.
</line><line>Judge:
His... His socks... You can see his socks...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much <textEffects>shorter</textEffects> than the defendant! <textEffects>(Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
That's curious...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What is?
</line><line>Mia:
Edgeworth is unusually calm today...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's true...
</line><line>Mia:
He's just letting the trial run itself; as if he's only along for the ride.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Along for the ride"...? What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Mia:
I can only think that perhaps he <textEffects>doesn't feel under attack</textEffects> at all...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAT!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?
</line>


<line>Judge:
A-Adrian Andrews...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?
</line><line>Phoenix:
For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.
</line><line>Judge:
And how does that all add up?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!
</line><line>Judge:
The knife that was used as a murder weapon!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!)</textEffects> The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to <textEffects>frame the defendant</textEffects> for the crime!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
This court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Alright! This is it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
This... is kind of bad for us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Mia:
If Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
One more day...? Ack!! <textEffects>(If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, we shall set Ms. Andrews' testimony for tomorrow...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
I abhor wasting such valuable time...
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I request that you please continue with today's trial.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk. "Unexpected" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
And what do you mean by that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
</line><line>Judge:
What is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Somehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
The court will now take a 10 minute recess.

Dude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... Her.
</line><line>Engarde:
So after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...
</line><line>Phoenix:
See, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.
</line><line>Engarde:
Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. She is the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.
</line><line>Engarde:
But... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She has her own agenda.
</line><line>Engarde:
H-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.
</line><line>Engarde:
Get me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's <textEffects>missing suicide note</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live. But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killer herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...
</line><line>Mia:
...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!
</line><line>Mia:
That sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, what...?
</line><line>Mia:
Who was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?
</line><line>Phoenix:

It looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.

Court will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
What is your occupation?
</line><line>Andrews:
I am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Now then...
</line><line>Andrews:
Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.
</line><line>Judge:
Uh, yes, sure. What is it?
</line><line>Andrews:
I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly "magazine" recently...
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of "Gossip Land"...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, so it was a "fry 'n bait" matter... or was that "bait 'n fry"? Reminds me of fishing...
</line><line>Andrews:
But I... But I didn't kill him.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No one has accused you of that.
</line><line>Andrews:
I've got a feeling someone will soon...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
I think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Very well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.

It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.
After that, I went to Juan's room.
And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...
What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.
I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You poured yourself a glass of juice...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... I know.
</line><line>Mia:
In order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pace.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Disrupt her pace...?
</line><line>Mia:
She's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?

</line><line>Andrews:
And what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.

Hmm, actually... So would I...
</line><line>Andrews:
I... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...

It was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.

Wh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?
</line><line>Andrews:
I'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess.

It's not "some" problem, it's a "major" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the <textEffects>inside</textEffects>, not the outside!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's very true!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Furthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.
</line><line>Judge:
And wh-what is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.
</line><line>Judge:
And what is wrong with that?

If the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!

She's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
I'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I have your proof right here. This wine glass.
</line><line>Andrews:
The wine glass?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You left <textEffects>your fingerprints</textEffects> very clearly on this wine glass.
</line><line>Andrews:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Even if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?
</line><line>Andrews:
Ugn!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!
</line><line>Mia:
Looks like you hit the nail on the head this time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...? What do you mean?
</line><line>Mia:
I believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But it's just an empty case...
</line><line>Mia:
I wonder if it really was empty though...
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...

Your Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...

</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase "fell <textEffects>onto</textEffects> the guitar case"! Which means that the case was <textEffects>closed</textEffects> when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh...
</line><line>Judge:
Can you do that, Mr. Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...
</line><line>Judge:
The bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Deflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Th-This is... This is a photograph...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
I-In this picture...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a <textEffects>costume</textEffects>!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That insane point would be to <textEffects>wear</textEffects> the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?
</line><line>Judge:
You... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?
</line><line>Mia:
Nice job, Phoenix.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a <textEffects>spare one</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...?
</line><line>Judge:
Then... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were <textEffects>TWO</textEffects> Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, that is what I am saying.
</line><line>Judge:
And how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It would mean that the victim himself had <textEffects>planned to bring this spare</textEffects> to the ceremony!
</line><line>Judge:
But... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the <textEffects>Jammin' Ninja</textEffects>. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Ah, so that's what he intended...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh!? N-No, I just...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Alright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...
</line>


<line>Judge:
What is this...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special <textEffects>press conference</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
A press conference...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to <textEffects>confess</textEffects> something at this conference.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had <textEffects>no idea</textEffects> he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Judge:
But how can that be!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, <textEffects>Mr. Juan Corrida</textEffects> himself!
</line><line>Judge:
Th-The victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the "<textEffects>Nickel Samurai</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Judge:
He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is <textEffects>what he intended to reveal</textEffects> at that conference.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Nickel Samurai was going to "<textEffects>confess</textEffects>" something. And by "confess", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about "<textEffects>himself</textEffects>".
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about <textEffects>Matt Engarde</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I guess that is what it would mean...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, if that's the case... that's not a "confession"! That's "<textEffects>public disclosure</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Andrews:
Hmph.
</line><line>Judge:
M-Ms. Andrews...?
</line><line>Andrews:
I can see why you are pros at what you do.
</line><line>Judge:
Pardon me?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!
</line><line>Andrews:
I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.
</line><line>Judge:
You...!?
</line><line>Andrews:
Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was <textEffects>going down with him</textEffects>. That's what he thought anyway.
</line><line>Judge:
He was going to ruin him, huh...?
</line><line>Andrews:
It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a <textEffects>secret so powerful</textEffects>... that it would <textEffects>destroy Matt's acting career</textEffects> had it been revealed!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What!?
</line><line>Judge:
And do you know what this "secret" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?
</line><line>Andrews:
... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah... I see.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Andrews:
I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Protect Mr. Engarde!?
</line><line>Judge:
And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes, Your Honor. I understand.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Protecting Matt --</textEffects></center>
<line>Andrews:
From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.
Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.
And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.
My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...
But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... This does account for everything...
</line><line>Andrews:
Well... I am the logical type.
</line><line>Mia:
We're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.
</line><line>Judge:
If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony. Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Protecting Matt --</textEffects></center>
<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>From the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Andrews:
<textEffects>But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
As I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.
</line><line>Mia:
Really? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wishy-washy? <textEffects>(Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
You should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Got it, Chief! <textEffects>(...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was "<textEffects>strangulation by a scarf</textEffects>".
</line><line>Andrews:
S...Strangulation...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The knife stab to the victim was done <textEffects>after</textEffects> the victim had already died.
</line><line>Judge:
A-And what does that mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>After</textEffects> the knife was stabbed into the victim...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was <textEffects>strangled to death</textEffects> in that fight!
</line><line>Andrews:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What "purpose"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer <textEffects>had something in mind</textEffects>, wouldn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
There is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!
</line><line>Judge:
And... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!
</line><line>Andrews:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Any evidence"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!
</line><line>Andrews:
Wh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can't, can I? Would you care to test me?
</line><line>Andrews:
Then... Then what about this knife!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from <textEffects>his room</textEffects>. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.
</line><line>Andrews:
...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This button was removed from the victim's body <textEffects>after</textEffects> he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the <textEffects>person who found his body</textEffects> or the <textEffects>killer</textEffects>. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!
</line><line>Andrews:
Ughn...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Judge:
I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>Andrews:
N...No... I...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!
</line><line>Judge:
...! Th-That's right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic "dazed discoverer" of a dead body!
</line><line>Andrews:
Aaaaaah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?
</line><line>Andrews:
P-Please... Stop...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?
</line><line>Andrews:
Um...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got her this time!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Andrews...?
</line><line>Andrews:
... I... I... I refuse... to testify.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What was that...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid <textEffects>self-incrimination</textEffects>... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAT!? <textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Pleading the fifth</textEffects>" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>von Karma:
Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>Andrews:
Y-Yes...?
</line><line>von Karma:
Think hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?
</line><line>Andrews:
A-Alright... ...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's it. That's when Franziska <span style="color:#E16935">planted this idea</textEffects> into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to <textEffects>not testify</textEffects> if things looked bad.)</span>
</line><line>Mia:
You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Something I haven't done...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Everything you have proven is circumstantial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Circumstantial</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of <textEffects>definitive proof</textEffects>. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?
</line><line>Andrews:
I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.
</line><line>Judge:
But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be "guilty" of due to my silence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!)</textEffects> M-Mia! What should we do...?
</line><line>Mia:
Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.
</line><line>Judge:
I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with <textEffects>solid definitive proof</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But! That's not true!
</line><line>Judge:
In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-Recess...!?
</line><line>Judge:
I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">T-Tomorrow</textEffects>...!? We don't have a "tomorrow"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Please wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...?
</line><line>Judge:
But it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is not impossible for this trial to continue.
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Yes, that is very true, but...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.
</line><line>Andrews:
Y-Yes... And...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.
</line><line>Andrews:
So my actions were "unusual"? But I've already...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.
</line><line>Andrews:
Testify...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Mia:
I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...
</line><line>Judge:
The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- When I Found the Body --</textEffects></center>
<line>Andrews:
That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.
I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.
And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.
When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.
To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.
When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?
</line><line>Andrews:
...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.
</line><line>Mia:
Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know. <textEffects>(Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.

<line>Mia:
... This is what it all comes down to.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Mia:
This is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?
</line><line>Andrews:
No, not at all...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Even though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?
</line><line>Andrews:
...Ah!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Isn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!
</line><line>Andrews:
Ah... Um... That's... Well, you see...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Your point is...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!
</line><line>Andrews:
Ungh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!
</line><line>Andrews:
... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...
</line><line>Andrews:
That... But that's impossible! You're wrong...
</line><line>Judge:
M-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!
</line><line>Andrews:
It... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you "might" end up incriminating yourself!
</line><line>Andrews:
Th-That's because...
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may "incriminate" you?
</line><line>Andrews:
... I... I... I refuse... to testify.
</line><line>Judge:
Then there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Mia:
What's wrong, Phoenix?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Usually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute real truth.
</line><line>Judge:
The "absolute real truth"...? What are you...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Witness... Don't you understand yet?
</line><line>Andrews:
...Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you "protect" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the <textEffects>guilty party</textEffects>!
</line><line>Andrews:
...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...?
</line><line>Andrews:
I... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
I... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...
</line><line>Mia:
It's Franziska von Karma...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh...?
</line><line>Mia:
Don't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...
</line><line>Mia:
Yesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by <textEffects>Ms. von Karma</textEffects>. "Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted." Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
It wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
The court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Come now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
</line>


<line>Judge:
That's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.
</line><line>Andrews:
...Y...You're wrong...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Such a shame...
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.
</line><line>Andrews:
...S...Stop...
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.
</line><line>Andrews:
What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.
</line><line>Andrews:
S-Stop... Please stop...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.
</line><line>Andrews:
Ah! Th-That's...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's the second part of the suicide report; the <span style="color:#E16935">attempted suicide report</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The secret of her <span style="color:#E16935">co-dependant nature</textEffects>... Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)</span>
</line><line>Andrews:
Please! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you're going to say you would "choose death", that is of no concern to me.
</line><line>Andrews:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, before you die... I will pull the truth from your breathing lips! ... No matter what I have to do.
</line><line>Andrews:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.
</line><line>Andrews:
... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- My "Crime" --</textEffects></center>
<line>Andrews:
When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.
When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.
Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.
And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.
Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.
And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
S-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?
</line><line>Andrews:
Isn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh... What do you mean by all of this...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.
</line><line>Andrews:
The real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("Last time"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her "crime"!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.

<line><i>(Pressing all statements leads to:)</i>
</line><line>Judge:
I think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?
</line><line>Andrews:
...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.
</line><line>Judge:
M-My word... What does all this mean...?
</line><line>Andrews:
...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Andrews:
The real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Franziska, huh...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Andrews:
She said that I should under no circumstances confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found <textEffects>guilty</textEffects> for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>...............

What this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!

Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Understood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.
</line><line>Judge:
That's all. Court is adjourned for today!

</line><line>Andrews:
What is it...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Before you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Oh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"The room"...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"That day"...?
</line><line>Andrews:
Yes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You found that card... next to the victim's body?
</line><line>Andrews:
I suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)</textEffects>
