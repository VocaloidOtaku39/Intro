  <poem>
    <lb number="1"/>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
    <lb number="2"/>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
    <lb number="3"/>But as the riper should by time decease,
    <lb number="4"/>His tender heir might bear his memory:
    <lb number="5"/>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
    <lb number="6"/>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
    <lb number="7"/>Making a famine where abundance lies,
    <lb number="8"/>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
    <lb number="9"/>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
    <lb number="10"/>And only herald to the gaudy spring,
    <lb number="11"/>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
    <lb number="12"/>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    <lb number="13"/>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    <lb number="14"/>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="15"/>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
    <lb number="16"/>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
    <lb number="17"/>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
    <lb number="18"/>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
    <lb number="19"/>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
    <lb number="20"/>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
    <lb number="21"/>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
    <lb number="22"/>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
    <lb number="23"/>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
    <lb number="24"/>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
    <lb number="25"/>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
    <lb number="26"/>Proving his beauty by succession thine!
    <lb number="27"/>This were to be new made when thou art old,
    <lb number="28"/>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="29"/>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
    <lb number="30"/>Now is the time that face should form another;
    <lb number="31"/>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
    <lb number="32"/>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
    <lb number="33"/>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
    <lb number="34"/>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
    <lb number="35"/>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
    <lb number="36"/>Of his self-love to stop posterity?
    <lb number="37"/>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
    <lb number="38"/>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
    <lb number="39"/>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
    <lb number="40"/>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    <lb number="41"/>But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
    <lb number="42"/>Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="43"/>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
    <lb number="44"/>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
    <lb number="45"/>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
    <lb number="46"/>And being frank she lends to those are free:
    <lb number="47"/>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
    <lb number="48"/>The bounteous largess given thee to give?
    <lb number="49"/>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
    <lb number="50"/>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
    <lb number="51"/>For having traffic with thy self alone,
    <lb number="52"/>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
    <lb number="53"/>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
    <lb number="54"/>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
    <lb number="55"/>Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    <lb number="56"/>Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="57"/>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
    <lb number="58"/>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
    <lb number="59"/>Will play the tyrants to the very same
    <lb number="60"/>And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
    <lb number="61"/>For never-resting time leads summer on
    <lb number="62"/>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
    <lb number="63"/>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
    <lb number="64"/>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
    <lb number="65"/>Then were not summer's distillation left,
    <lb number="66"/>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
    <lb number="67"/>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
    <lb number="68"/>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
    <lb number="69"/>But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
    <lb number="70"/>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="71"/>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
    <lb number="72"/>In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
    <lb number="73"/>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
    <lb number="74"/>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
    <lb number="75"/>That use is not forbidden usury,
    <lb number="76"/>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
    <lb number="77"/>That's for thy self to breed another thee,
    <lb number="78"/>Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
    <lb number="79"/>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
    <lb number="80"/>If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
    <lb number="81"/>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
    <lb number="82"/>Leaving thee living in posterity?
    <lb number="83"/>Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
    <lb number="84"/>To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="85"/>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
    <lb number="86"/>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
    <lb number="87"/>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
    <lb number="88"/>Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
    <lb number="89"/>And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
    <lb number="90"/>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
    <lb number="91"/>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
    <lb number="92"/>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
    <lb number="93"/>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
    <lb number="94"/>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
    <lb number="95"/>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
    <lb number="96"/>From his low tract, and look another way:
    <lb number="97"/>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
    <lb number="98"/>Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="99"/>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
    <lb number="100"/>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
    <lb number="101"/>Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
    <lb number="102"/>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
    <lb number="103"/>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
    <lb number="104"/>By unions married, do offend thine ear,
    <lb number="105"/>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
    <lb number="106"/>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
    <lb number="107"/>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
    <lb number="108"/>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
    <lb number="109"/>Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
    <lb number="110"/>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    <lb number="111"/>Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
    <lb number="112"/>Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="113"/>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
    <lb number="114"/>That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
    <lb number="115"/>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
    <lb number="116"/>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
    <lb number="117"/>The world will be thy widow and still weep
    <lb number="118"/>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
    <lb number="119"/>When every private widow well may keep
    <lb number="120"/>By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
    <lb number="121"/>Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
    <lb number="122"/>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
    <lb number="123"/>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
    <lb number="124"/>And kept unused the user so destroys it.
    <lb number="125"/>No love toward others in that bosom sits
    <lb number="126"/>That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="127"/>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
    <lb number="128"/>Who for thy self art so unprovident.
    <lb number="129"/>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
    <lb number="130"/>But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
    <lb number="131"/>For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
    <lb number="132"/>That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
    <lb number="133"/>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
    <lb number="134"/>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
    <lb number="135"/>O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
    <lb number="136"/>Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
    <lb number="137"/>Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
    <lb number="138"/>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
    <lb number="139"/>Make thee another self for love of me,
    <lb number="140"/>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="141"/>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
    <lb number="142"/>In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
    <lb number="143"/>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
    <lb number="144"/>Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
    <lb number="145"/>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
    <lb number="146"/>Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
    <lb number="147"/>If all were minded so, the times should cease
    <lb number="148"/>And threescore year would make the world away.
    <lb number="149"/>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
    <lb number="150"/>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
    <lb number="151"/>Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
    <lb number="152"/>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    <lb number="153"/>She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    <lb number="154"/>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="155"/>When I do count the clock that tells the time,
    <lb number="156"/>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
    <lb number="157"/>When I behold the violet past prime,
    <lb number="158"/>And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
    <lb number="159"/>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
    <lb number="160"/>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
    <lb number="161"/>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
    <lb number="162"/>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
    <lb number="163"/>Then of thy beauty do I question make,
    <lb number="164"/>That thou among the wastes of time must go,
    <lb number="165"/>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
    <lb number="166"/>And die as fast as they see others grow;
    <lb number="167"/>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    <lb number="168"/>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="169"/>O! that you were your self; but, love you are
    <lb number="170"/>No longer yours, than you your self here live:
    <lb number="171"/>Against this coming end you should prepare,
    <lb number="172"/>And your sweet semblance to some other give:
    <lb number="173"/>So should that beauty which you hold in lease
    <lb number="174"/>Find no determination; then you were
    <lb number="175"/>Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
    <lb number="176"/>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
    <lb number="177"/>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
    <lb number="178"/>Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
    <lb number="179"/>Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
    <lb number="180"/>And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
    <lb number="181"/>O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
    <lb number="182"/>You had a father: let your son say so.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="183"/>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
    <lb number="184"/>And yet methinks I have astronomy,
    <lb number="185"/>But not to tell of good or evil luck,
    <lb number="186"/>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
    <lb number="187"/>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
    <lb number="188"/>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
    <lb number="189"/>Or say with princes if it shall go well
    <lb number="190"/>By oft predict that I in heaven find:
    <lb number="191"/>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
    <lb number="192"/>And constant stars in them I read such art
    <lb number="193"/>As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
    <lb number="194"/>If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
    <lb number="195"/>Or else of thee this I prognosticate: 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and
    date.' </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="196"/>When I consider every thing that grows
    <lb number="197"/>Holds in perfection but a little moment,
    <lb number="198"/>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
    <lb number="199"/>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
    <lb number="200"/>When I perceive that men as plants increase,
    <lb number="201"/>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
    <lb number="202"/>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
    <lb number="203"/>And wear their brave state out of memory;
    <lb number="204"/>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
    <lb number="205"/>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
    <lb number="206"/>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
    <lb number="207"/>To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    <lb number="208"/>And all in war with Time for love of you,
    <lb number="209"/>As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="210"/>But wherefore do not you a mightier way
    <lb number="211"/>Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
    <lb number="212"/>And fortify your self in your decay
    <lb number="213"/>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
    <lb number="214"/>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
    <lb number="215"/>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
    <lb number="216"/>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
    <lb number="217"/>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
    <lb number="218"/>So should the lines of life that life repair,
    <lb number="219"/>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
    <lb number="220"/>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
    <lb number="221"/>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    <lb number="222"/>To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    <lb number="223"/>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="224"/>Who will believe my verse in time to come,
    <lb number="225"/>If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
    <lb number="226"/>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
    <lb number="227"/>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
    <lb number="228"/>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
    <lb number="229"/>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
    <lb number="230"/>The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
    <lb number="231"/>Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
    <lb number="232"/>So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
    <lb number="233"/>Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
    <lb number="234"/>And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
    <lb number="235"/>And stretched metre of an antique song:
    <lb number="236"/>But were some child of yours alive that time,
    <lb number="237"/>You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="238"/>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    <lb number="239"/>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    <lb number="240"/>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    <lb number="241"/>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
    <lb number="242"/>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    <lb number="243"/>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
    <lb number="244"/>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    <lb number="245"/>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
    <lb number="246"/>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    <lb number="247"/>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
    <lb number="248"/>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
    <lb number="249"/>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
    <lb number="250"/>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    <lb number="251"/>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="252"/>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
    <lb number="253"/>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
    <lb number="254"/>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
    <lb number="255"/>And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
    <lb number="256"/>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
    <lb number="257"/>And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
    <lb number="258"/>To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
    <lb number="259"/>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
    <lb number="260"/>O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
    <lb number="261"/>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
    <lb number="262"/>Him in thy course untainted do allow
    <lb number="263"/>For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
    <lb number="264"/>Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
    <lb number="265"/>My love shall in my verse ever live young.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="266"/>A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
    <lb number="267"/>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
    <lb number="268"/>A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
    <lb number="269"/>With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
    <lb number="270"/>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
    <lb number="271"/>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
    <lb number="272"/>A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
    <lb number="273"/>Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
    <lb number="274"/>And for a woman wert thou first created;
    <lb number="275"/>Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
    <lb number="276"/>And by addition me of thee defeated,
    <lb number="277"/>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    <lb number="278"/>But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
    <lb number="279"/>Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="280"/>So is it not with me as with that Muse,
    <lb number="281"/>Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
    <lb number="282"/>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
    <lb number="283"/>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
    <lb number="284"/>Making a couplement of proud compare'
    <lb number="285"/>With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
    <lb number="286"/>With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
    <lb number="287"/>That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
    <lb number="288"/>O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
    <lb number="289"/>And then believe me, my love is as fair
    <lb number="290"/>As any mother's child, though not so bright
    <lb number="291"/>As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
    <lb number="292"/>Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
    <lb number="293"/>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="294"/>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
    <lb number="295"/>So long as youth and thou are of one date;
    <lb number="296"/>But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
    <lb number="297"/>Then look I death my days should expiate.
    <lb number="298"/>For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
    <lb number="299"/>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
    <lb number="300"/>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
    <lb number="301"/>How can I then be elder than thou art?
    <lb number="302"/>O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
    <lb number="303"/>As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
    <lb number="304"/>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
    <lb number="305"/>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    <lb number="306"/>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    <lb number="307"/>Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="308"/>As an unperfect actor on the stage,
    <lb number="309"/>Who with his fear is put beside his part,
    <lb number="310"/>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
    <lb number="311"/>Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
    <lb number="312"/>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
    <lb number="313"/>The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
    <lb number="314"/>And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
    <lb number="315"/>O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
    <lb number="316"/>O! let my looks be then the eloquence
    <lb number="317"/>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
    <lb number="318"/>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
    <lb number="319"/>More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
    <lb number="320"/>O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
    <lb number="321"/>To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="322"/>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
    <lb number="323"/>Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
    <lb number="324"/>My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
    <lb number="325"/>And perspective it is best painter's art.
    <lb number="326"/>For through the painter must you see his skill,
    <lb number="327"/>To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
    <lb number="328"/>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
    <lb number="329"/>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
    <lb number="330"/>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
    <lb number="331"/>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
    <lb number="332"/>Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
    <lb number="333"/>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
    <lb number="334"/>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    <lb number="335"/>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="336"/>Let those who are in favour with their stars
    <lb number="337"/>Of public honour and proud titles boast,
    <lb number="338"/>Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
    <lb number="339"/>Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
    <lb number="340"/>Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
    <lb number="341"/>But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
    <lb number="342"/>And in themselves their pride lies buried,
    <lb number="343"/>For at a frown they in their glory die.
    <lb number="344"/>The painful warrior famoused for fight,
    <lb number="345"/>After a thousand victories once foil'd,
    <lb number="346"/>Is from the book of honour razed quite,
    <lb number="347"/>And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
    <lb number="348"/>Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
    <lb number="349"/>Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="350"/>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
    <lb number="351"/>Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
    <lb number="352"/>To thee I send this written embassage,
    <lb number="353"/>To witness duty, not to show my wit:
    <lb number="354"/>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
    <lb number="355"/>May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
    <lb number="356"/>But that I hope some good conceit of thine
    <lb number="357"/>In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
    <lb number="358"/>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
    <lb number="359"/>Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
    <lb number="360"/>And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
    <lb number="361"/>To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
    <lb number="362"/>Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
    <lb number="363"/>Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="364"/>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
    <lb number="365"/>The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
    <lb number="366"/>But then begins a journey in my head
    <lb number="367"/>To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
    <lb number="368"/>For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
    <lb number="369"/>Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
    <lb number="370"/>And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
    <lb number="371"/>Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
    <lb number="372"/>Save that my soul's imaginary sight
    <lb number="373"/>Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
    <lb number="374"/>Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
    <lb number="375"/>Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    <lb number="376"/>Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    <lb number="377"/>For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="378"/>How can I then return in happy plight,
    <lb number="379"/>That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
    <lb number="380"/>When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
    <lb number="381"/>But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
    <lb number="382"/>And each, though enemies to either's reign,
    <lb number="383"/>Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
    <lb number="384"/>The one by toil, the other to complain
    <lb number="385"/>How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
    <lb number="386"/>I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
    <lb number="387"/>And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
    <lb number="388"/>So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
    <lb number="389"/>When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
    <lb number="390"/>But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    <lb number="391"/>And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="392"/>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
    <lb number="393"/>I all alone beweep my outcast state,
    <lb number="394"/>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
    <lb number="395"/>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
    <lb number="396"/>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
    <lb number="397"/>Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
    <lb number="398"/>Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
    <lb number="399"/>With what I most enjoy contented least;
    <lb number="400"/>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
    <lb number="401"/>Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
    <lb number="402"/>Like to the lark at break of day arising
    <lb number="403"/>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
    <lb number="404"/>For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
    <lb number="405"/>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="406"/>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
    <lb number="407"/>I summon up remembrance of things past,
    <lb number="408"/>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
    <lb number="409"/>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
    <lb number="410"/>Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
    <lb number="411"/>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
    <lb number="412"/>And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
    <lb number="413"/>And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
    <lb number="414"/>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
    <lb number="415"/>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
    <lb number="416"/>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
    <lb number="417"/>Which I new pay as if not paid before.
    <lb number="418"/>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
    <lb number="419"/>All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="420"/>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
    <lb number="421"/>Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
    <lb number="422"/>And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
    <lb number="423"/>And all those friends which I thought buried.
    <lb number="424"/>How many a holy and obsequious tear
    <lb number="425"/>Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
    <lb number="426"/>As interest of the dead, which now appear
    <lb number="427"/>But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
    <lb number="428"/>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
    <lb number="429"/>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
    <lb number="430"/>Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
    <lb number="431"/>That due of many now is thine alone:
    <lb number="432"/>Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
    <lb number="433"/>And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="434"/>If thou survive my well-contented day,
    <lb number="435"/>When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
    <lb number="436"/>And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
    <lb number="437"/>These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
    <lb number="438"/>Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
    <lb number="439"/>And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
    <lb number="440"/>Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
    <lb number="441"/>Exceeded by the height of happier men.
    <lb number="442"/>O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought: 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this
    growing age, <lb number="443"/>A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
    <lb number="444"/>To march in ranks of better equipage:
    <lb number="445"/>But since he died and poets better prove,
    <lb number="446"/>Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="447"/>Full many a glorious morning have I seen
    <lb number="448"/>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
    <lb number="449"/>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
    <lb number="450"/>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
    <lb number="451"/>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
    <lb number="452"/>With ugly rack on his celestial face,
    <lb number="453"/>And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
    <lb number="454"/>Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
    <lb number="455"/>Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
    <lb number="456"/>With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
    <lb number="457"/>But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
    <lb number="458"/>The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
    <lb number="459"/>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
    <lb number="460"/>Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="461"/>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
    <lb number="462"/>And make me travel forth without my cloak,
    <lb number="463"/>To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
    <lb number="464"/>Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke? 'Tis not enough that through the cloud
    thou break, <lb number="465"/>To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
    <lb number="466"/>For no man well of such a salve can speak,
    <lb number="467"/>That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
    <lb number="468"/>Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
    <lb number="469"/>Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
    <lb number="470"/>The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
    <lb number="471"/>To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    <lb number="472"/>Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    <lb number="473"/>And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="474"/>No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
    <lb number="475"/>Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
    <lb number="476"/>Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
    <lb number="477"/>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
    <lb number="478"/>All men make faults, and even I in this,
    <lb number="479"/>Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
    <lb number="480"/>Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
    <lb number="481"/>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
    <lb number="482"/>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
    <lb number="483"/>Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
    <lb number="484"/>And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
    <lb number="485"/>Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    <lb number="486"/>That I an accessary needs must be,
    <lb number="487"/>To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="488"/>Let me confess that we two must be twain,
    <lb number="489"/>Although our undivided loves are one:
    <lb number="490"/>So shall those blots that do with me remain,
    <lb number="491"/>Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
    <lb number="492"/>In our two loves there is but one respect,
    <lb number="493"/>Though in our lives a separable spite,
    <lb number="494"/>Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
    <lb number="495"/>Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
    <lb number="496"/>I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
    <lb number="497"/>Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
    <lb number="498"/>Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
    <lb number="499"/>Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    <lb number="500"/>But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    <lb number="501"/>As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="502"/>As a decrepit father takes delight
    <lb number="503"/>To see his active child do deeds of youth,
    <lb number="504"/>So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
    <lb number="505"/>Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
    <lb number="506"/>For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
    <lb number="507"/>Or any of these all, or all, or more,
    <lb number="508"/>Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
    <lb number="509"/>I make my love engrafted, to this store:
    <lb number="510"/>So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
    <lb number="511"/>Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
    <lb number="512"/>That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
    <lb number="513"/>And by a part of all thy glory live.
    <lb number="514"/>Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    <lb number="515"/>This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="516"/>How can my muse want subject to invent,
    <lb number="517"/>While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
    <lb number="518"/>Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
    <lb number="519"/>For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
    <lb number="520"/>O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
    <lb number="521"/>Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
    <lb number="522"/>For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
    <lb number="523"/>When thou thy self dost give invention light?
    <lb number="524"/>Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
    <lb number="525"/>Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
    <lb number="526"/>And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
    <lb number="527"/>Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    <lb number="528"/>If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    <lb number="529"/>The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="530"/>O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
    <lb number="531"/>When thou art all the better part of me?
    <lb number="532"/>What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
    <lb number="533"/>And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
    <lb number="534"/>Even for this, let us divided live,
    <lb number="535"/>And our dear love lose name of single one,
    <lb number="536"/>That by this separation I may give
    <lb number="537"/>That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
    <lb number="538"/>O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
    <lb number="539"/>Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
    <lb number="540"/>To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
    <lb number="541"/>Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    <lb number="542"/>And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    <lb number="543"/>By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="544"/>Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
    <lb number="545"/>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
    <lb number="546"/>No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
    <lb number="547"/>All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
    <lb number="548"/>Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
    <lb number="549"/>I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
    <lb number="550"/>But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
    <lb number="551"/>By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
    <lb number="552"/>I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
    <lb number="553"/>Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
    <lb number="554"/>And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
    <lb number="555"/>To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
    <lb number="556"/>Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    <lb number="557"/>Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="558"/>Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
    <lb number="559"/>When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
    <lb number="560"/>Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
    <lb number="561"/>For still temptation follows where thou art.
    <lb number="562"/>Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
    <lb number="563"/>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
    <lb number="564"/>And when a woman woos, what woman's son
    <lb number="565"/>Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
    <lb number="566"/>Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
    <lb number="567"/>And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
    <lb number="568"/>Who lead thee in their riot even there
    <lb number="569"/>Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
    <lb number="570"/>Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    <lb number="571"/>Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="572"/>That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
    <lb number="573"/>And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
    <lb number="574"/>That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
    <lb number="575"/>A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
    <lb number="576"/>Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
    <lb number="577"/>Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
    <lb number="578"/>And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
    <lb number="579"/>Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
    <lb number="580"/>If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
    <lb number="581"/>And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
    <lb number="582"/>Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
    <lb number="583"/>And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
    <lb number="584"/>But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
    <lb number="585"/>Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="586"/>When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
    <lb number="587"/>For all the day they view things unrespected;
    <lb number="588"/>But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
    <lb number="589"/>And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
    <lb number="590"/>Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
    <lb number="591"/>How would thy shadow's form form happy show
    <lb number="592"/>To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
    <lb number="593"/>When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
    <lb number="594"/>How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
    <lb number="595"/>By looking on thee in the living day,
    <lb number="596"/>When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
    <lb number="597"/>Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    <lb number="598"/>All days are nights to see till I see thee,
    <lb number="599"/>And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="600"/>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
    <lb number="601"/>Injurious distance should not stop my way;
    <lb number="602"/>For then despite of space I would be brought,
    <lb number="603"/>From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
    <lb number="604"/>No matter then although my foot did stand
    <lb number="605"/>Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
    <lb number="606"/>For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
    <lb number="607"/>As soon as think the place where he would be.
    <lb number="608"/>But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
    <lb number="609"/>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
    <lb number="610"/>But that so much of earth and water wrought,
    <lb number="611"/>I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
    <lb number="612"/>Receiving nought by elements so slow
    <lb number="613"/>But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="614"/>The other two, slight air, and purging fire
    <lb number="615"/>Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
    <lb number="616"/>The first my thought, the other my desire,
    <lb number="617"/>These present-absent with swift motion slide.
    <lb number="618"/>For when these quicker elements are gone
    <lb number="619"/>In tender embassy of love to thee,
    <lb number="620"/>My life, being made of four, with two alone
    <lb number="621"/>Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
    <lb number="622"/>Until life's composition be recur'd
    <lb number="623"/>By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
    <lb number="624"/>Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
    <lb number="625"/>Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
    <lb number="626"/>This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
    <lb number="627"/>I send them back again, and straight grow sad.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="628"/>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
    <lb number="629"/>How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
    <lb number="630"/>Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
    <lb number="631"/>My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
    <lb number="632"/>My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
    <lb number="633"/>A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
    <lb number="634"/>But the defendant doth that plea deny,
    <lb number="635"/>And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
    <lb number="636"/>To side this title is impannelled
    <lb number="637"/>A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
    <lb number="638"/>And by their verdict is determined
    <lb number="639"/>The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
    <lb number="640"/>As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
    <lb number="641"/>And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="642"/>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
    <lb number="643"/>And each doth good turns now unto the other:
    <lb number="644"/>When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
    <lb number="645"/>Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
    <lb number="646"/>With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
    <lb number="647"/>And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
    <lb number="648"/>Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
    <lb number="649"/>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
    <lb number="650"/>So, either by thy picture or my love,
    <lb number="651"/>Thy self away, art present still with me;
    <lb number="652"/>For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
    <lb number="653"/>And I am still with them, and they with thee;
    <lb number="654"/>Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    <lb number="655"/>Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="656"/>How careful was I when I took my way,
    <lb number="657"/>Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
    <lb number="658"/>That to my use it might unused stay
    <lb number="659"/>From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
    <lb number="660"/>But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
    <lb number="661"/>Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
    <lb number="662"/>Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
    <lb number="663"/>Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
    <lb number="664"/>Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
    <lb number="665"/>Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
    <lb number="666"/>Within the gentle closure of my breast,
    <lb number="667"/>From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
    <lb number="668"/>And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    <lb number="669"/>For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="670"/>Against that time, if ever that time come,
    <lb number="671"/>When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
    <lb number="672"/>When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
    <lb number="673"/>Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
    <lb number="674"/>Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
    <lb number="675"/>And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
    <lb number="676"/>When love, converted from the thing it was,
    <lb number="677"/>Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
    <lb number="678"/>Against that time do I ensconce me here,
    <lb number="679"/>Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
    <lb number="680"/>And this my hand, against my self uprear,
    <lb number="681"/>To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
    <lb number="682"/>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
    <lb number="683"/>Since why to love I can allege no cause.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="684"/>How heavy do I journey on the way,
    <lb number="685"/>When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
    <lb number="686"/>Doth teach that ease and that repose to say, 'Thus far the miles are measured from
    thy friend!' <lb number="687"/>The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
    <lb number="688"/>Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
    <lb number="689"/>As if by some instinct the wretch did know
    <lb number="690"/>His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
    <lb number="691"/>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
    <lb number="692"/>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
    <lb number="693"/>Which heavily he answers with a groan,
    <lb number="694"/>More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
    <lb number="695"/>For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    <lb number="696"/>My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="697"/>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
    <lb number="698"/>Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
    <lb number="699"/>From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
    <lb number="700"/>Till I return, of posting is no need.
    <lb number="701"/>O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
    <lb number="702"/>When swift extremity can seem but slow?
    <lb number="703"/>Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
    <lb number="704"/>In winged speed no motion shall I know,
    <lb number="705"/>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
    <lb number="706"/>Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
    <lb number="707"/>Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
    <lb number="708"/>But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,-- 'Since from thee going, he went
    wilful-slow, <lb number="709"/>Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="710"/>So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
    <lb number="711"/>Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
    <lb number="712"/>The which he will not every hour survey,
    <lb number="713"/>For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
    <lb number="714"/>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
    <lb number="715"/>Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
    <lb number="716"/>Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
    <lb number="717"/>Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
    <lb number="718"/>So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
    <lb number="719"/>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
    <lb number="720"/>To make some special instant special-blest,
    <lb number="721"/>By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
    <lb number="722"/>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    <lb number="723"/>Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="724"/>What is your substance, whereof are you made,
    <lb number="725"/>That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
    <lb number="726"/>Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
    <lb number="727"/>And you but one, can every shadow lend.
    <lb number="728"/>Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
    <lb number="729"/>Is poorly imitated after you;
    <lb number="730"/>On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
    <lb number="731"/>And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
    <lb number="732"/>Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
    <lb number="733"/>The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
    <lb number="734"/>The other as your bounty doth appear;
    <lb number="735"/>And you in every blessed shape we know.
    <lb number="736"/>In all external grace you have some part,
    <lb number="737"/>But you like none, none you, for constant heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="738"/>O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
    <lb number="739"/>By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
    <lb number="740"/>The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
    <lb number="741"/>For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
    <lb number="742"/>The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
    <lb number="743"/>As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
    <lb number="744"/>Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
    <lb number="745"/>When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
    <lb number="746"/>But, for their virtue only is their show,
    <lb number="747"/>They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
    <lb number="748"/>Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
    <lb number="749"/>Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    <lb number="750"/>And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    <lb number="751"/>When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="752"/>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
    <lb number="753"/>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
    <lb number="754"/>But you shall shine more bright in these contents
    <lb number="755"/>Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
    <lb number="756"/>When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
    <lb number="757"/>And broils root out the work of masonry,
    <lb number="758"/>Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
    <lb number="759"/>The living record of your memory.
    <lb number="760"/>'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
    <lb number="761"/>Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
    <lb number="762"/>Even in the eyes of all posterity
    <lb number="763"/>That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    <lb number="764"/>So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
    <lb number="765"/>You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="766"/>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
    <lb number="767"/>Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
    <lb number="768"/>Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
    <lb number="769"/>To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
    <lb number="770"/>So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
    <lb number="771"/>Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
    <lb number="772"/>To-morrow see again, and do not kill
    <lb number="773"/>The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
    <lb number="774"/>Let this sad interim like the ocean be
    <lb number="775"/>Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
    <lb number="776"/>Come daily to the banks, that when they see
    <lb number="777"/>Return of love, more blest may be the view;
    <lb number="778"/>Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    <lb number="779"/>Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="780"/>Being your slave what should I do but tend,
    <lb number="781"/>Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
    <lb number="782"/>I have no precious time at all to spend;
    <lb number="783"/>Nor services to do, till you require.
    <lb number="784"/>Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
    <lb number="785"/>Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
    <lb number="786"/>Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
    <lb number="787"/>When you have bid your servant once adieu;
    <lb number="788"/>Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
    <lb number="789"/>Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
    <lb number="790"/>But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
    <lb number="791"/>Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
    <lb number="792"/>So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    <lb number="793"/>Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="794"/>That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
    <lb number="795"/>I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
    <lb number="796"/>Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
    <lb number="797"/>Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
    <lb number="798"/>O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
    <lb number="799"/>The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
    <lb number="800"/>And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
    <lb number="801"/>Without accusing you of injury.
    <lb number="802"/>Be where you list, your charter is so strong
    <lb number="803"/>That you yourself may privilage your time
    <lb number="804"/>To what you will; to you it doth belong
    <lb number="805"/>Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
    <lb number="806"/>I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    <lb number="807"/>Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="808"/>If there be nothing new, but that which is
    <lb number="809"/>Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
    <lb number="810"/>Which labouring for invention bear amiss
    <lb number="811"/>The second burthen of a former child!
    <lb number="812"/>O! that record could with a backward look,
    <lb number="813"/>Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
    <lb number="814"/>Show me your image in some antique book,
    <lb number="815"/>Since mind at first in character was done!
    <lb number="816"/>That I might see what the old world could say
    <lb number="817"/>To this composed wonder of your frame;
    <lb number="818"/>Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
    <lb number="819"/>Or whether revolution be the same.
    <lb number="820"/>O! sure I am the wits of former days,
    <lb number="821"/>To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="822"/>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
    <lb number="823"/>So do our minutes hasten to their end;
    <lb number="824"/>Each changing place with that which goes before,
    <lb number="825"/>In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
    <lb number="826"/>Nativity, once in the main of light,
    <lb number="827"/>Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
    <lb number="828"/>Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
    <lb number="829"/>And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
    <lb number="830"/>Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
    <lb number="831"/>And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
    <lb number="832"/>Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
    <lb number="833"/>And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
    <lb number="834"/>And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
    <lb number="835"/>Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="836"/>Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
    <lb number="837"/>My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
    <lb number="838"/>Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
    <lb number="839"/>While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
    <lb number="840"/>Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
    <lb number="841"/>So far from home into my deeds to pry,
    <lb number="842"/>To find out shames and idle hours in me,
    <lb number="843"/>The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
    <lb number="844"/>O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
    <lb number="845"/>It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
    <lb number="846"/>Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
    <lb number="847"/>To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
    <lb number="848"/>For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    <lb number="849"/>From me far off, with others all too near.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="850"/>Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
    <lb number="851"/>And all my soul, and all my every part;
    <lb number="852"/>And for this sin there is no remedy,
    <lb number="853"/>It is so grounded inward in my heart.
    <lb number="854"/>Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
    <lb number="855"/>No shape so true, no truth of such account;
    <lb number="856"/>And for myself mine own worth do define,
    <lb number="857"/>As I all other in all worths surmount.
    <lb number="858"/>But when my glass shows me myself indeed
    <lb number="859"/>Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
    <lb number="860"/>Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
    <lb number="861"/>Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    <lb number="862"/>'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    <lb number="863"/>Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="864"/>Against my love shall be as I am now,
    <lb number="865"/>With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
    <lb number="866"/>When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
    <lb number="867"/>With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
    <lb number="868"/>Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
    <lb number="869"/>And all those beauties whereof now he's king
    <lb number="870"/>Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
    <lb number="871"/>Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
    <lb number="872"/>For such a time do I now fortify
    <lb number="873"/>Against confounding age's cruel knife,
    <lb number="874"/>That he shall never cut from memory
    <lb number="875"/>My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
    <lb number="876"/>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    <lb number="877"/>And they shall live, and he in them still green.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="878"/>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
    <lb number="879"/>The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
    <lb number="880"/>When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
    <lb number="881"/>And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
    <lb number="882"/>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
    <lb number="883"/>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
    <lb number="884"/>And the firm soil win of the watery main,
    <lb number="885"/>Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
    <lb number="886"/>When I have seen such interchange of state,
    <lb number="887"/>Or state itself confounded, to decay;
    <lb number="888"/>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
    <lb number="889"/>That Time will come and take my love away.
    <lb number="890"/>This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    <lb number="891"/>But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="892"/>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
    <lb number="893"/>But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
    <lb number="894"/>How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
    <lb number="895"/>Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
    <lb number="896"/>O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
    <lb number="897"/>Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
    <lb number="898"/>When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
    <lb number="899"/>Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
    <lb number="900"/>O fearful meditation! where, alack,
    <lb number="901"/>Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
    <lb number="902"/>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
    <lb number="903"/>Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    <lb number="904"/>O! none, unless this miracle have might,
    <lb number="905"/>That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="906"/>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
    <lb number="907"/>As to behold desert a beggar born,
    <lb number="908"/>And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
    <lb number="909"/>And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
    <lb number="910"/>And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
    <lb number="911"/>And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
    <lb number="912"/>And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
    <lb number="913"/>And strength by limping sway disabled
    <lb number="914"/>And art made tongue-tied by authority,
    <lb number="915"/>And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
    <lb number="916"/>And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
    <lb number="917"/>And captive good attending captain ill:
    <lb number="918"/>Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
    <lb number="919"/>Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="920"/>Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
    <lb number="921"/>And with his presence grace impiety,
    <lb number="922"/>That sin by him advantage should achieve,
    <lb number="923"/>And lace itself with his society?
    <lb number="924"/>Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
    <lb number="925"/>And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
    <lb number="926"/>Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
    <lb number="927"/>Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
    <lb number="928"/>Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
    <lb number="929"/>Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
    <lb number="930"/>For she hath no exchequer now but his,
    <lb number="931"/>And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    <lb number="932"/>O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    <lb number="933"/>In days long since, before these last so bad.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="934"/>Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
    <lb number="935"/>When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
    <lb number="936"/>Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
    <lb number="937"/>Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
    <lb number="938"/>Before the golden tresses of the dead,
    <lb number="939"/>The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
    <lb number="940"/>To live a second life on second head;
    <lb number="941"/>Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
    <lb number="942"/>In him those holy antique hours are seen,
    <lb number="943"/>Without all ornament, itself and true,
    <lb number="944"/>Making no summer of another's green,
    <lb number="945"/>Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    <lb number="946"/>And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    <lb number="947"/>To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="948"/>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
    <lb number="949"/>Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
    <lb number="950"/>All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
    <lb number="951"/>Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
    <lb number="952"/>Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
    <lb number="953"/>But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
    <lb number="954"/>In other accents do this praise confound
    <lb number="955"/>By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
    <lb number="956"/>They look into the beauty of thy mind,
    <lb number="957"/>And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
    <lb number="958"/>Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
    <lb number="959"/>To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
    <lb number="960"/>But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    <lb number="961"/>The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="962"/>That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
    <lb number="963"/>For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
    <lb number="964"/>The ornament of beauty is suspect,
    <lb number="965"/>A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
    <lb number="966"/>So thou be good, slander doth but approve
    <lb number="967"/>Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
    <lb number="968"/>For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
    <lb number="969"/>And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
    <lb number="970"/>Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
    <lb number="971"/>Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
    <lb number="972"/>Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
    <lb number="973"/>To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    <lb number="974"/>If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    <lb number="975"/>Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="976"/>No longer mourn for me when I am dead
    <lb number="977"/>Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
    <lb number="978"/>Give warning to the world that I am fled
    <lb number="979"/>From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
    <lb number="980"/>Nay, if you read this line, remember not
    <lb number="981"/>The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
    <lb number="982"/>That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
    <lb number="983"/>If thinking on me then should make you woe.
    <lb number="984"/>O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
    <lb number="985"/>When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
    <lb number="986"/>Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
    <lb number="987"/>But let your love even with my life decay;
    <lb number="988"/>Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    <lb number="989"/>And mock you with me after I am gone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="990"/>O! lest the world should task you to recite
    <lb number="991"/>What merit lived in me, that you should love
    <lb number="992"/>After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
    <lb number="993"/>For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
    <lb number="994"/>Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
    <lb number="995"/>To do more for me than mine own desert,
    <lb number="996"/>And hang more praise upon deceased I
    <lb number="997"/>Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
    <lb number="998"/>O! lest your true love may seem false in this
    <lb number="999"/>That you for love speak well of me untrue,
    <lb number="1000"/>My name be buried where my body is,
    <lb number="1001"/>And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
    <lb number="1002"/>For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    <lb number="1003"/>And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1004"/>That time of year thou mayst in me behold
    <lb number="1005"/>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
    <lb number="1006"/>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
    <lb number="1007"/>Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
    <lb number="1008"/>In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
    <lb number="1009"/>As after sunset fadeth in the west;
    <lb number="1010"/>Which by and by black night doth take away,
    <lb number="1011"/>Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
    <lb number="1012"/>In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
    <lb number="1013"/>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
    <lb number="1014"/>As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
    <lb number="1015"/>Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    <lb number="1016"/>This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    <lb number="1017"/>To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1018"/>But be contented: when that fell arrest
    <lb number="1019"/>Without all bail shall carry me away,
    <lb number="1020"/>My life hath in this line some interest,
    <lb number="1021"/>Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
    <lb number="1022"/>When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
    <lb number="1023"/>The very part was consecrate to thee:
    <lb number="1024"/>The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
    <lb number="1025"/>My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
    <lb number="1026"/>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
    <lb number="1027"/>The prey of worms, my body being dead;
    <lb number="1028"/>The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
    <lb number="1029"/>Too base of thee to be remembered.
    <lb number="1030"/>The worth of that is that which it contains,
    <lb number="1031"/>And that is this, and this with thee remains.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1032"/>So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
    <lb number="1033"/>Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
    <lb number="1034"/>And for the peace of you I hold such strife
    <lb number="1035"/>As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
    <lb number="1036"/>Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
    <lb number="1037"/>Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
    <lb number="1038"/>Now counting best to be with you alone,
    <lb number="1039"/>Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
    <lb number="1040"/>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
    <lb number="1041"/>And by and by clean starved for a look;
    <lb number="1042"/>Possessing or pursuing no delight,
    <lb number="1043"/>Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    <lb number="1044"/>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    <lb number="1045"/>Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1046"/>Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
    <lb number="1047"/>So far from variation or quick change?
    <lb number="1048"/>Why with the time do I not glance aside
    <lb number="1049"/>To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
    <lb number="1050"/>Why write I still all one, ever the same,
    <lb number="1051"/>And keep invention in a noted weed,
    <lb number="1052"/>That every word doth almost tell my name,
    <lb number="1053"/>Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
    <lb number="1054"/>O! know sweet love I always write of you,
    <lb number="1055"/>And you and love are still my argument;
    <lb number="1056"/>So all my best is dressing old words new,
    <lb number="1057"/>Spending again what is already spent:
    <lb number="1058"/>For as the sun is daily new and old,
    <lb number="1059"/>So is my love still telling what is told.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1060"/>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
    <lb number="1061"/>Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
    <lb number="1062"/>These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
    <lb number="1063"/>And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
    <lb number="1064"/>The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
    <lb number="1065"/>Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
    <lb number="1066"/>Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
    <lb number="1067"/>Time's thievish progress to eternity.
    <lb number="1068"/>Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
    <lb number="1069"/>Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
    <lb number="1070"/>Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
    <lb number="1071"/>To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    <lb number="1072"/>These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    <lb number="1073"/>Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1074"/>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
    <lb number="1075"/>And found such fair assistance in my verse
    <lb number="1076"/>As every alien pen hath got my use
    <lb number="1077"/>And under thee their poesy disperse.
    <lb number="1078"/>Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
    <lb number="1079"/>And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
    <lb number="1080"/>Have added feathers to the learned's wing
    <lb number="1081"/>And given grace a double majesty.
    <lb number="1082"/>Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
    <lb number="1083"/>Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
    <lb number="1084"/>In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
    <lb number="1085"/>And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
    <lb number="1086"/>But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    <lb number="1087"/>As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1088"/>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
    <lb number="1089"/>My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
    <lb number="1090"/>But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
    <lb number="1091"/>And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
    <lb number="1092"/>I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
    <lb number="1093"/>Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
    <lb number="1094"/>Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
    <lb number="1095"/>He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
    <lb number="1096"/>He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
    <lb number="1097"/>From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
    <lb number="1098"/>And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
    <lb number="1099"/>No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    <lb number="1100"/>Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    <lb number="1101"/>Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1102"/>O! how I faint when I of you do write,
    <lb number="1103"/>Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
    <lb number="1104"/>And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
    <lb number="1105"/>To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
    <lb number="1106"/>But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
    <lb number="1107"/>The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
    <lb number="1108"/>My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
    <lb number="1109"/>On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
    <lb number="1110"/>Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
    <lb number="1111"/>Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
    <lb number="1112"/>Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
    <lb number="1113"/>He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
    <lb number="1114"/>Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    <lb number="1115"/>The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1116"/>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
    <lb number="1117"/>Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
    <lb number="1118"/>From hence your memory death cannot take,
    <lb number="1119"/>Although in me each part will be forgotten.
    <lb number="1120"/>Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
    <lb number="1121"/>Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
    <lb number="1122"/>The earth can yield me but a common grave,
    <lb number="1123"/>When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
    <lb number="1124"/>Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
    <lb number="1125"/>Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
    <lb number="1126"/>And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
    <lb number="1127"/>When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    <lb number="1128"/>You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--
    <lb number="1129"/>Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1130"/>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
    <lb number="1131"/>And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
    <lb number="1132"/>The dedicated words which writers use
    <lb number="1133"/>Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
    <lb number="1134"/>Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
    <lb number="1135"/>Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
    <lb number="1136"/>And therefore art enforced to seek anew
    <lb number="1137"/>Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
    <lb number="1138"/>And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
    <lb number="1139"/>What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
    <lb number="1140"/>Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
    <lb number="1141"/>In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
    <lb number="1142"/>And their gross painting might be better us'd
    <lb number="1143"/>Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1144"/>I never saw that you did painting need,
    <lb number="1145"/>And therefore to your fair no painting set;
    <lb number="1146"/>I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
    <lb number="1147"/>That barren tender of a poet's debt:
    <lb number="1148"/>And therefore have I slept in your report,
    <lb number="1149"/>That you yourself, being extant, well might show
    <lb number="1150"/>How far a modern quill doth come too short,
    <lb number="1151"/>Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
    <lb number="1152"/>This silence for my sin you did impute,
    <lb number="1153"/>Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
    <lb number="1154"/>For I impair not beauty being mute,
    <lb number="1155"/>When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    <lb number="1156"/>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    <lb number="1157"/>Than both your poets can in praise devise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1158"/>Who is it that says most, which can say more,
    <lb number="1159"/>Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
    <lb number="1160"/>In whose confine immured is the store
    <lb number="1161"/>Which should example where your equal grew.
    <lb number="1162"/>Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
    <lb number="1163"/>That to his subject lends not some small glory;
    <lb number="1164"/>But he that writes of you, if he can tell
    <lb number="1165"/>That you are you, so dignifies his story,
    <lb number="1166"/>Let him but copy what in you is writ,
    <lb number="1167"/>Not making worse what nature made so clear,
    <lb number="1168"/>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
    <lb number="1169"/>Making his style admired every where.
    <lb number="1170"/>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    <lb number="1171"/>Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1172"/>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
    <lb number="1173"/>While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
    <lb number="1174"/>Reserve their character with golden quill,
    <lb number="1175"/>And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
    <lb number="1176"/>I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
    <lb number="1177"/>And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
    <lb number="1178"/>To every hymn that able spirit affords,
    <lb number="1179"/>In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
    <lb number="1180"/>Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
    <lb number="1181"/>And to the most of praise add something more;
    <lb number="1182"/>But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
    <lb number="1183"/>Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    <lb number="1184"/>Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    <lb number="1185"/>Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1186"/>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
    <lb number="1187"/>Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
    <lb number="1188"/>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
    <lb number="1189"/>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
    <lb number="1190"/>Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
    <lb number="1191"/>Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
    <lb number="1192"/>No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
    <lb number="1193"/>Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
    <lb number="1194"/>He, nor that affable familiar ghost
    <lb number="1195"/>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
    <lb number="1196"/>As victors of my silence cannot boast;
    <lb number="1197"/>I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    <lb number="1198"/>But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    <lb number="1199"/>Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1200"/>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
    <lb number="1201"/>And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
    <lb number="1202"/>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
    <lb number="1203"/>My bonds in thee are all determinate.
    <lb number="1204"/>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
    <lb number="1205"/>And for that riches where is my deserving?
    <lb number="1206"/>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
    <lb number="1207"/>And so my patent back again is swerving.
    <lb number="1208"/>Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
    <lb number="1209"/>Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
    <lb number="1210"/>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
    <lb number="1211"/>Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    <lb number="1212"/>Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    <lb number="1213"/>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1214"/>When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
    <lb number="1215"/>And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
    <lb number="1216"/>Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
    <lb number="1217"/>And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
    <lb number="1218"/>With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
    <lb number="1219"/>Upon thy part I can set down a story
    <lb number="1220"/>Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
    <lb number="1221"/>That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
    <lb number="1222"/>And I by this will be a gainer too;
    <lb number="1223"/>For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
    <lb number="1224"/>The injuries that to myself I do,
    <lb number="1225"/>Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    <lb number="1226"/>Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    <lb number="1227"/>That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1228"/>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
    <lb number="1229"/>And I will comment upon that offence:
    <lb number="1230"/>Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
    <lb number="1231"/>Against thy reasons making no defence.
    <lb number="1232"/>Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
    <lb number="1233"/>To set a form upon desired change,
    <lb number="1234"/>As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
    <lb number="1235"/>I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
    <lb number="1236"/>Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
    <lb number="1237"/>Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
    <lb number="1238"/>Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
    <lb number="1239"/>And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    <lb number="1240"/>For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    <lb number="1241"/>For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1242"/>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
    <lb number="1243"/>Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
    <lb number="1244"/>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
    <lb number="1245"/>And do not drop in for an after-loss:
    <lb number="1246"/>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
    <lb number="1247"/>Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
    <lb number="1248"/>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
    <lb number="1249"/>To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
    <lb number="1250"/>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
    <lb number="1251"/>When other petty griefs have done their spite,
    <lb number="1252"/>But in the onset come: so shall I taste
    <lb number="1253"/>At first the very worst of fortune's might;
    <lb number="1254"/>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    <lb number="1255"/>Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1256"/>Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
    <lb number="1257"/>Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
    <lb number="1258"/>Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
    <lb number="1259"/>Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
    <lb number="1260"/>And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
    <lb number="1261"/>Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
    <lb number="1262"/>But these particulars are not my measure,
    <lb number="1263"/>All these I better in one general best.
    <lb number="1264"/>Thy love is better than high birth to me,
    <lb number="1265"/>Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
    <lb number="1266"/>Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
    <lb number="1267"/>And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
    <lb number="1268"/>Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
    <lb number="1269"/>All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1270"/>But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
    <lb number="1271"/>For term of life thou art assured mine;
    <lb number="1272"/>And life no longer than thy love will stay,
    <lb number="1273"/>For it depends upon that love of thine.
    <lb number="1274"/>Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
    <lb number="1275"/>When in the least of them my life hath end.
    <lb number="1276"/>I see a better state to me belongs
    <lb number="1277"/>Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
    <lb number="1278"/>Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
    <lb number="1279"/>Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
    <lb number="1280"/>O! what a happy title do I find,
    <lb number="1281"/>Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    <lb number="1282"/>But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    <lb number="1283"/>Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1284"/>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
    <lb number="1285"/>Like a deceived husband; so love's face
    <lb number="1286"/>May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
    <lb number="1287"/>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
    <lb number="1288"/>For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
    <lb number="1289"/>Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
    <lb number="1290"/>In many's looks, the false heart's history
    <lb number="1291"/>Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
    <lb number="1292"/>But heaven in thy creation did decree
    <lb number="1293"/>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
    <lb number="1294"/>Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
    <lb number="1295"/>Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
    <lb number="1296"/>How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    <lb number="1297"/>If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1298"/>They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
    <lb number="1299"/>That do not do the thing they most do show,
    <lb number="1300"/>Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
    <lb number="1301"/>Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
    <lb number="1302"/>They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
    <lb number="1303"/>And husband nature's riches from expense;
    <lb number="1304"/>They are the lords and owners of their faces,
    <lb number="1305"/>Others, but stewards of their excellence.
    <lb number="1306"/>The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
    <lb number="1307"/>Though to itself, it only live and die,
    <lb number="1308"/>But if that flower with base infection meet,
    <lb number="1309"/>The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
    <lb number="1310"/>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
    <lb number="1311"/>Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1312"/>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
    <lb number="1313"/>Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
    <lb number="1314"/>Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
    <lb number="1315"/>O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
    <lb number="1316"/>That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
    <lb number="1317"/>Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
    <lb number="1318"/>Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
    <lb number="1319"/>Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
    <lb number="1320"/>O! what a mansion have those vices got
    <lb number="1321"/>Which for their habitation chose out thee,
    <lb number="1322"/>Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
    <lb number="1323"/>And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
    <lb number="1324"/>Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
    <lb number="1325"/>The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1326"/>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
    <lb number="1327"/>Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
    <lb number="1328"/>Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
    <lb number="1329"/>Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
    <lb number="1330"/>As on the finger of a throned queen
    <lb number="1331"/>The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
    <lb number="1332"/>So are those errors that in thee are seen
    <lb number="1333"/>To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
    <lb number="1334"/>How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
    <lb number="1335"/>If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
    <lb number="1336"/>How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
    <lb number="1337"/>if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    <lb number="1338"/>But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
    <lb number="1339"/>As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1340"/>How like a winter hath my absence been
    <lb number="1341"/>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
    <lb number="1342"/>What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
    <lb number="1343"/>What old December's bareness everywhere!
    <lb number="1344"/>And yet this time removed was summer's time;
    <lb number="1345"/>The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
    <lb number="1346"/>Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
    <lb number="1347"/>Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
    <lb number="1348"/>Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
    <lb number="1349"/>But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
    <lb number="1350"/>For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
    <lb number="1351"/>And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
    <lb number="1352"/>Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    <lb number="1353"/>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1354"/>From you have I been absent in the spring,
    <lb number="1355"/>When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
    <lb number="1356"/>Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
    <lb number="1357"/>That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
    <lb number="1358"/>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
    <lb number="1359"/>Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
    <lb number="1360"/>Could make me any summer's story tell,
    <lb number="1361"/>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
    <lb number="1362"/>Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
    <lb number="1363"/>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
    <lb number="1364"/>They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
    <lb number="1365"/>Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    <lb number="1366"/>Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
    <lb number="1367"/>As with your shadow I with these did play.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1368"/>The forward violet thus did I chide:
    <lb number="1369"/>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
    <lb number="1370"/>If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
    <lb number="1371"/>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
    <lb number="1372"/>In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
    <lb number="1373"/>The lily I condemned for thy hand,
    <lb number="1374"/>And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
    <lb number="1375"/>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
    <lb number="1376"/>One blushing shame, another white despair;
    <lb number="1377"/>A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
    <lb number="1378"/>And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
    <lb number="1379"/>But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
    <lb number="1380"/>A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    <lb number="1381"/>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
    <lb number="1382"/>But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1383"/>Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
    <lb number="1384"/>To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
    <lb number="1385"/>Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
    <lb number="1386"/>Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
    <lb number="1387"/>Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
    <lb number="1388"/>In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
    <lb number="1389"/>Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
    <lb number="1390"/>And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
    <lb number="1391"/>Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
    <lb number="1392"/>If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
    <lb number="1393"/>If any, be a satire to decay,
    <lb number="1394"/>And make time's spoils despised every where.
    <lb number="1395"/>Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    <lb number="1396"/>So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1397"/>O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
    <lb number="1398"/>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
    <lb number="1399"/>Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
    <lb number="1400"/>So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
    <lb number="1401"/>Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say, 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour
    fix'd; <lb number="1402"/>Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
    <lb number="1403"/>But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
    <lb number="1404"/>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
    <lb number="1405"/>Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
    <lb number="1406"/>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
    <lb number="1407"/>And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
    <lb number="1408"/>Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
    <lb number="1409"/>To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1410"/>My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
    <lb number="1411"/>I love not less, though less the show appear;
    <lb number="1412"/>That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
    <lb number="1413"/>The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
    <lb number="1414"/>Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
    <lb number="1415"/>When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
    <lb number="1416"/>As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
    <lb number="1417"/>And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
    <lb number="1418"/>Not that the summer is less pleasant now
    <lb number="1419"/>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
    <lb number="1420"/>But that wild music burthens every bough,
    <lb number="1421"/>And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    <lb number="1422"/>Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    <lb number="1423"/>Because I would not dull you with my song.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1424"/>Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
    <lb number="1425"/>That having such a scope to show her pride,
    <lb number="1426"/>The argument, all bare, is of more worth
    <lb number="1427"/>Than when it hath my added praise beside!
    <lb number="1428"/>O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
    <lb number="1429"/>Look in your glass, and there appears a face
    <lb number="1430"/>That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
    <lb number="1431"/>Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
    <lb number="1432"/>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
    <lb number="1433"/>To mar the subject that before was well?
    <lb number="1434"/>For to no other pass my verses tend
    <lb number="1435"/>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
    <lb number="1436"/>And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
    <lb number="1437"/>Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1438"/>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
    <lb number="1439"/>For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
    <lb number="1440"/>Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
    <lb number="1441"/>Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
    <lb number="1442"/>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
    <lb number="1443"/>In process of the seasons have I seen,
    <lb number="1444"/>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
    <lb number="1445"/>Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
    <lb number="1446"/>Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
    <lb number="1447"/>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
    <lb number="1448"/>So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
    <lb number="1449"/>Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
    <lb number="1450"/>For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
    <lb number="1451"/>Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1452"/>Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
    <lb number="1453"/>Nor my beloved as an idol show,
    <lb number="1454"/>Since all alike my songs and praises be
    <lb number="1455"/>To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
    <lb number="1456"/>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
    <lb number="1457"/>Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
    <lb number="1458"/>Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
    <lb number="1459"/>One thing expressing, leaves out difference. 'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my
    argument, 'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words; <lb number="1460"/>And in this change is my
      invention spent,
    <lb number="1461"/>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    <lb number="1462"/>Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
    <lb number="1463"/>Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1464"/>When in the chronicle of wasted time
    <lb number="1465"/>I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
    <lb number="1466"/>And beauty making beautiful old rime,
    <lb number="1467"/>In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
    <lb number="1468"/>Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
    <lb number="1469"/>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
    <lb number="1470"/>I see their antique pen would have express'd
    <lb number="1471"/>Even such a beauty as you master now.
    <lb number="1472"/>So all their praises are but prophecies
    <lb number="1473"/>Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
    <lb number="1474"/>And for they looked but with divining eyes,
    <lb number="1475"/>They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    <lb number="1476"/>For we, which now behold these present days,
    <lb number="1477"/>Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1478"/>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
    <lb number="1479"/>Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
    <lb number="1480"/>Can yet the lease of my true love control,
    <lb number="1481"/>Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
    <lb number="1482"/>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
    <lb number="1483"/>And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
    <lb number="1484"/>Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
    <lb number="1485"/>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
    <lb number="1486"/>Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
    <lb number="1487"/>My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
    <lb number="1488"/>Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
    <lb number="1489"/>While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
    <lb number="1490"/>And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    <lb number="1491"/>When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1492"/>What's in the brain, that ink may character,
    <lb number="1493"/>Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
    <lb number="1494"/>What's new to speak, what now to register,
    <lb number="1495"/>That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
    <lb number="1496"/>Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
    <lb number="1497"/>I must each day say o'er the very same;
    <lb number="1498"/>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
    <lb number="1499"/>Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
    <lb number="1500"/>So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
    <lb number="1501"/>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
    <lb number="1502"/>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
    <lb number="1503"/>But makes antiquity for aye his page;
    <lb number="1504"/>Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    <lb number="1505"/>Where time and outward form would show it dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1506"/>O! never say that I was false of heart,
    <lb number="1507"/>Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
    <lb number="1508"/>As easy might I from my self depart
    <lb number="1509"/>As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
    <lb number="1510"/>That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
    <lb number="1511"/>Like him that travels, I return again;
    <lb number="1512"/>Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
    <lb number="1513"/>So that myself bring water for my stain.
    <lb number="1514"/>Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
    <lb number="1515"/>All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
    <lb number="1516"/>That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
    <lb number="1517"/>To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
    <lb number="1518"/>For nothing this wide universe I call,
    <lb number="1519"/>Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1520"/>Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
    <lb number="1521"/>And made my self a motley to the view,
    <lb number="1522"/>Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
    <lb number="1523"/>Made old offences of affections new;
    <lb number="1524"/>Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
    <lb number="1525"/>Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
    <lb number="1526"/>These blenches gave my heart another youth,
    <lb number="1527"/>And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
    <lb number="1528"/>Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
    <lb number="1529"/>Mine appetite I never more will grind
    <lb number="1530"/>On newer proof, to try an older friend,
    <lb number="1531"/>A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
    <lb number="1532"/>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    <lb number="1533"/>Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1534"/>O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
    <lb number="1535"/>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
    <lb number="1536"/>That did not better for my life provide
    <lb number="1537"/>Than public means which public manners breeds.
    <lb number="1538"/>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
    <lb number="1539"/>And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
    <lb number="1540"/>To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
    <lb number="1541"/>Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
    <lb number="1542"/>Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
    <lb number="1543"/>Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
    <lb number="1544"/>No bitterness that I will bitter think,
    <lb number="1545"/>Nor double penance, to correct correction.
    <lb number="1546"/>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
    <lb number="1547"/>Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1548"/>Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
    <lb number="1549"/>Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
    <lb number="1550"/>For what care I who calls me well or ill,
    <lb number="1551"/>So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
    <lb number="1552"/>You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
    <lb number="1553"/>To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
    <lb number="1554"/>None else to me, nor I to none alive,
    <lb number="1555"/>That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
    <lb number="1556"/>In so profound abysm I throw all care
    <lb number="1557"/>Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
    <lb number="1558"/>To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
    <lb number="1559"/>Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
    <lb number="1560"/>You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    <lb number="1561"/>That all the world besides methinks are dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1562"/>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
    <lb number="1563"/>And that which governs me to go about
    <lb number="1564"/>Doth part his function and is partly blind,
    <lb number="1565"/>Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
    <lb number="1566"/>For it no form delivers to the heart
    <lb number="1567"/>Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
    <lb number="1568"/>Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
    <lb number="1569"/>Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
    <lb number="1570"/>For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
    <lb number="1571"/>The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
    <lb number="1572"/>The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
    <lb number="1573"/>The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    <lb number="1574"/>Incapable of more, replete with you,
    <lb number="1575"/>My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1576"/>Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
    <lb number="1577"/>Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
    <lb number="1578"/>Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
    <lb number="1579"/>And that your love taught it this alchemy,
    <lb number="1580"/>To make of monsters and things indigest
    <lb number="1581"/>Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
    <lb number="1582"/>Creating every bad a perfect best,
    <lb number="1583"/>As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
    <lb number="1584"/>O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
    <lb number="1585"/>And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
    <lb number="1586"/>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
    <lb number="1587"/>And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
    <lb number="1588"/>If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
    <lb number="1589"/>That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1590"/>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
    <lb number="1591"/>Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
    <lb number="1592"/>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
    <lb number="1593"/>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
    <lb number="1594"/>But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
    <lb number="1595"/>Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
    <lb number="1596"/>Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
    <lb number="1597"/>Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
    <lb number="1598"/>Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
    <lb number="1599"/>Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
    <lb number="1600"/>When I was certain o'er incertainty,
    <lb number="1601"/>Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    <lb number="1602"/>Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
    <lb number="1603"/>To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1604"/>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
    <lb number="1605"/>Admit impediments. Love is not love
    <lb number="1606"/>Which alters when it alteration finds,
    <lb number="1607"/>Or bends with the remover to remove:
    <lb number="1608"/>O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
    <lb number="1609"/>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
    <lb number="1610"/>It is the star to every wandering bark,
    <lb number="1611"/>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
    <lb number="1612"/>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
    <lb number="1613"/>Within his bending sickle's compass come;
    <lb number="1614"/>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
    <lb number="1615"/>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
    <lb number="1616"/>If this be error and upon me prov'd,
    <lb number="1617"/>I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1618"/>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
    <lb number="1619"/>Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
    <lb number="1620"/>Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
    <lb number="1621"/>Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
    <lb number="1622"/>That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
    <lb number="1623"/>And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
    <lb number="1624"/>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
    <lb number="1625"/>Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
    <lb number="1626"/>Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
    <lb number="1627"/>And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
    <lb number="1628"/>Bring me within the level of your frown,
    <lb number="1629"/>But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
    <lb number="1630"/>Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
    <lb number="1631"/>The constancy and virtue of your love.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1632"/>Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
    <lb number="1633"/>With eager compounds we our palate urge;
    <lb number="1634"/>As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
    <lb number="1635"/>We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
    <lb number="1636"/>Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
    <lb number="1637"/>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
    <lb number="1638"/>And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
    <lb number="1639"/>To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
    <lb number="1640"/>Thus policy in love, to anticipate
    <lb number="1641"/>The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
    <lb number="1642"/>And brought to medicine a healthful state
    <lb number="1643"/>Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
    <lb number="1644"/>But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    <lb number="1645"/>Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1646"/>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
    <lb number="1647"/>Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
    <lb number="1648"/>Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
    <lb number="1649"/>Still losing when I saw myself to win!
    <lb number="1650"/>What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
    <lb number="1651"/>Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
    <lb number="1652"/>How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
    <lb number="1653"/>In the distraction of this madding fever!
    <lb number="1654"/>O benefit of ill! now I find true
    <lb number="1655"/>That better is, by evil still made better;
    <lb number="1656"/>And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
    <lb number="1657"/>Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    <lb number="1658"/>So I return rebuk'd to my content,
    <lb number="1659"/>And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

    <lb number="1660"/>That you were once unkind befriends me now,
    <lb number="1661"/>And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
    <lb number="1662"/>Needs must I under my transgression bow,
    <lb number="1663"/>Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
    <lb number="1664"/>For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
    <lb number="1665"/>As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
    <lb number="1666"/>And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
    <lb number="1667"/>To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
    <lb number="1668"/>O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
    <lb number="1669"/>My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
    <lb number="1670"/>And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
    <lb number="1671"/>The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    <lb number="1672"/>But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
    <lb number="1673"/>Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

  <poem>
    <lb number="1674"/>'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd, 
    <lb number="1675"/>When not to be receives reproach of being;
    <lb number="1676"/>And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
    <lb number="1677"/>Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
    <lb number="1678"/>For why should others' false adulterate eyes
    <lb number="1679"/>Give salutation to my sportive blood?
    <lb number="1680"/>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
    <lb number="1681"/>Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
    <lb number="1682"/>No, I am that I am, and they that level
    <lb number="1683"/>At my abuses reckon up their own:
    <lb number="1684"/>I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
    <lb number="1685"/>By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
    <lb number="1686"/>Unless this general evil they maintain,
    <lb number="1687"/>All men are bad and in their badness reign.

  <poem>
    <lb number="1688"/>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
    <lb number="1689"/>Full character'd with lasting memory,
    <lb number="1690"/>Which shall above that idle rank remain,
    <lb number="1691"/>Beyond all date; even to eternity:
    <lb number="1692"/>Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
    <lb number="1693"/>Have faculty by nature to subsist;
    <lb number="1694"/>Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
    <lb number="1695"/>Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
    <lb number="1696"/>That poor retention could not so much hold,
    <lb number="1697"/>Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
    <lb number="1698"/>Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
    <lb number="1699"/>To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    <lb number="1700"/>To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    <lb number="1701"/>Were to import forgetfulness in me.

  <poem>
    <lb number="1702"/>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
    <lb number="1703"/>Thy pyramids built up with newer might
    <lb number="1704"/>To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
    <lb number="1705"/>They are but dressings of a former sight.
    <lb number="1706"/>Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
    <lb number="1707"/>What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
    <lb number="1708"/>And rather make them born to our desire
    <lb number="1709"/>Than think that we before have heard them told.
    <lb number="1710"/>Thy registers and thee I both defy,
    <lb number="1711"/>Not wondering at the present nor the past,
    <lb number="1712"/>For thy records and what we see doth lie,
    <lb number="1713"/>Made more or less by thy continual haste.
    <lb number="1714"/>This I do vow and this shall ever be;
    <lb number="1715"/>I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1716"/>If my dear love were but the child of state,
    <lb number="1717"/>It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
    <lb number="1718"/>As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
    <lb number="1719"/>Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
    <lb number="1720"/>No, it was builded far from accident;
    <lb number="1721"/>It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
    <lb number="1722"/>Under the blow of thralled discontent,
    <lb number="1723"/>Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
    <lb number="1724"/>It fears not policy, that heretic,
    <lb number="1725"/>Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
    <lb number="1726"/>But all alone stands hugely politic,
    <lb number="1727"/>That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    <lb number="1728"/>To this I witness call the fools of time,
    <lb number="1729"/>Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

    <lb number="1730"/>Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
    <lb number="1731"/>With my extern the outward honouring,
    <lb number="1732"/>Or laid great bases for eternity,
    <lb number="1733"/>Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
    <lb number="1734"/>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
    <lb number="1735"/>Lose all and more by paying too much rent
    <lb number="1736"/>For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
    <lb number="1737"/>Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
    <lb number="1738"/>No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
    <lb number="1739"/>And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
    <lb number="1740"/>Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
    <lb number="1741"/>But mutual render, only me for thee.
    <lb number="1742"/>Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    <lb number="1743"/>When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

    <lb number="1744"/>O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
    <lb number="1745"/>Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
    <lb number="1746"/>Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
    <lb number="1747"/>Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
    <lb number="1748"/>If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
    <lb number="1749"/>As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
    <lb number="1750"/>She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
    <lb number="1751"/>May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
    <lb number="1752"/>Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
    <lb number="1753"/>She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    <lb number="1754"/>Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    <lb number="1755"/>And her quietus is to render thee.

    <lb number="1756"/>In the old age black was not counted fair,
    <lb number="1757"/>Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
    <lb number="1758"/>But now is black beauty's successive heir,
    <lb number="1759"/>And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
    <lb number="1760"/>For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
    <lb number="1761"/>Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
    <lb number="1762"/>Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
    <lb number="1763"/>But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
    <lb number="1764"/>Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
    <lb number="1765"/>Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
    <lb number="1766"/>At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
    <lb number="1767"/>Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
    <lb number="1768"/>Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    <lb number="1769"/>That every tongue says beauty should look so.

    <lb number="1770"/>How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
    <lb number="1771"/>Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
    <lb number="1772"/>With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
    <lb number="1773"/>The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
    <lb number="1774"/>Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
    <lb number="1775"/>To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
    <lb number="1776"/>Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
    <lb number="1777"/>At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
    <lb number="1778"/>To be so tickled, they would change their state
    <lb number="1779"/>And situation with those dancing chips,
    <lb number="1780"/>O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
    <lb number="1781"/>Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
    <lb number="1782"/>Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    <lb number="1783"/>Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

  <poem>
    <lb number="1784"/>The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
    <lb number="1785"/>Is lust in action: and till action, lust
    <lb number="1786"/>Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
    <lb number="1787"/>Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
    <lb number="1788"/>Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
    <lb number="1789"/>Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
    <lb number="1790"/>Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
    <lb number="1791"/>On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
    <lb number="1792"/>Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
    <lb number="1793"/>Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
    <lb number="1794"/>A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
    <lb number="1795"/>Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    <lb number="1796"/>All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    <lb number="1797"/>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1798"/>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
    <lb number="1799"/>Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
    <lb number="1800"/>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
    <lb number="1801"/>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
    <lb number="1802"/>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
    <lb number="1803"/>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
    <lb number="1804"/>And in some perfumes is there more delight
    <lb number="1805"/>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
    <lb number="1806"/>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
    <lb number="1807"/>That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
    <lb number="1808"/>I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
    <lb number="1809"/>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
    <lb number="1810"/>And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
    <lb number="1811"/>As any she belied with false compare.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1812"/>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
    <lb number="1813"/>As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
    <lb number="1814"/>For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
    <lb number="1815"/>Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
    <lb number="1816"/>Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
    <lb number="1817"/>Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
    <lb number="1818"/>To say they err I dare not be so bold,
    <lb number="1819"/>Although I swear it to myself alone.
    <lb number="1820"/>And to be sure that is not false I swear,
    <lb number="1821"/>A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
    <lb number="1822"/>One on another's neck, do witness bear
    <lb number="1823"/>Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
    <lb number="1824"/>In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    <lb number="1825"/>And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1826"/>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
    <lb number="1827"/>Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
    <lb number="1828"/>Have put on black and loving mourners be,
    <lb number="1829"/>Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
    <lb number="1830"/>And truly not the morning sun of heaven
    <lb number="1831"/>Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
    <lb number="1832"/>Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
    <lb number="1833"/>Doth half that glory to the sober west,
    <lb number="1834"/>As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
    <lb number="1835"/>O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
    <lb number="1836"/>To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
    <lb number="1837"/>And suit thy pity like in every part.
    <lb number="1838"/>Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    <lb number="1839"/>And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1840"/>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
    <lb number="1841"/>For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
    <lb number="1842"/>Is't not enough to torture me alone,
    <lb number="1843"/>But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
    <lb number="1844"/>Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
    <lb number="1845"/>And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
    <lb number="1846"/>Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
    <lb number="1847"/>A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:
    <lb number="1848"/>Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
    <lb number="1849"/>But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
    <lb number="1850"/>Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
    <lb number="1851"/>Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
    <lb number="1852"/>And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    <lb number="1853"/>Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1854"/>So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
    <lb number="1855"/>And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,
    <lb number="1856"/>Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
    <lb number="1857"/>Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
    <lb number="1858"/>But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
    <lb number="1859"/>For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
    <lb number="1860"/>He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
    <lb number="1861"/>Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
    <lb number="1862"/>The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
    <lb number="1863"/>Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
    <lb number="1864"/>And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
    <lb number="1865"/>So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
    <lb number="1866"/>Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
    <lb number="1867"/>He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1868"/>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
    <lb number="1869"/>And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;
    <lb number="1870"/>More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
    <lb number="1871"/>To thy sweet will making addition thus.
    <lb number="1872"/>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
    <lb number="1873"/>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
    <lb number="1874"/>Shall will in others seem right gracious,
    <lb number="1875"/>And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
    <lb number="1876"/>The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
    <lb number="1877"/>And in abundance addeth to his store;
    <lb number="1878"/>So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
    <lb number="1879"/>One will of mine, to make thy large will more.
    <lb number="1880"/>Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
    <lb number="1881"/>Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1882"/>If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
    <lb number="1883"/>Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
    <lb number="1884"/>And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
    <lb number="1885"/>Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil. 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of
    thy love, <lb number="1886"/>Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
    <lb number="1887"/>In things of great receipt with ease we prove
    <lb number="1888"/>Among a number one is reckon'd none:
    <lb number="1889"/>Then in the number let me pass untold,
    <lb number="1890"/>Though in thy store's account I one must be;
    <lb number="1891"/>For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
    <lb number="1892"/>That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
    <lb number="1893"/>Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    <lb number="1894"/>And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'

  <poem>
    <lb number="1895"/>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
    <lb number="1896"/>That they behold, and see not what they see?
    <lb number="1897"/>They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
    <lb number="1898"/>Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
    <lb number="1899"/>If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
    <lb number="1900"/>Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
    <lb number="1901"/>Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
    <lb number="1902"/>Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
    <lb number="1903"/>Why should my heart think that a several plot,
    <lb number="1904"/>Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
    <lb number="1905"/>Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
    <lb number="1906"/>To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    <lb number="1907"/>In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    <lb number="1908"/>And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1909"/>When my love swears that she is made of truth,
    <lb number="1910"/>I do believe her though I know she lies,
    <lb number="1911"/>That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
    <lb number="1912"/>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
    <lb number="1913"/>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
    <lb number="1914"/>Although she knows my days are past the best,
    <lb number="1915"/>Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
    <lb number="1916"/>On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
    <lb number="1917"/>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
    <lb number="1918"/>And wherefore say not I that I am old?
    <lb number="1919"/>O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
    <lb number="1920"/>And age in love, loves not to have years told:
    <lb number="1921"/>Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    <lb number="1922"/>And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1923"/>O! call not me to justify the wrong
    <lb number="1924"/>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
    <lb number="1925"/>Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
    <lb number="1926"/>Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
    <lb number="1927"/>Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
    <lb number="1928"/>Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
    <lb number="1929"/>What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
    <lb number="1930"/>Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?
    <lb number="1931"/>Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
    <lb number="1932"/>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
    <lb number="1933"/>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
    <lb number="1934"/>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    <lb number="1935"/>Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    <lb number="1936"/>Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1937"/>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
    <lb number="1938"/>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
    <lb number="1939"/>Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
    <lb number="1940"/>The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
    <lb number="1941"/>If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
    <lb number="1942"/>Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--
    <lb number="1943"/>As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
    <lb number="1944"/>No news but health from their physicians know;--
    <lb number="1945"/>For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
    <lb number="1946"/>And in my madness might speak ill of thee;
    <lb number="1947"/>Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
    <lb number="1948"/>Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    <lb number="1949"/>That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    <lb number="1950"/>Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1951"/>In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
    <lb number="1952"/>For they in thee a thousand errors note;
    <lb number="1953"/>But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
    <lb number="1954"/>Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.
    <lb number="1955"/>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
    <lb number="1956"/>Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
    <lb number="1957"/>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
    <lb number="1958"/>To any sensual feast with thee alone:
    <lb number="1959"/>But my five wits nor my five senses can
    <lb number="1960"/>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
    <lb number="1961"/>Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
    <lb number="1962"/>Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
    <lb number="1963"/>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    <lb number="1964"/>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="1965"/>Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
    <lb number="1966"/>Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
    <lb number="1967"/>O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,
    <lb number="1968"/>And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
    <lb number="1969"/>Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
    <lb number="1970"/>That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
    <lb number="1971"/>And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
    <lb number="1972"/>Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
    <lb number="1973"/>Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
    <lb number="1974"/>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
    <lb number="1975"/>Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
    <lb number="1976"/>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    <lb number="1977"/>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    <lb number="1978"/>By self-example mayst thou be denied!

    <lb number="1979"/>Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
    <lb number="1980"/>One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
    <lb number="1981"/>Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
    <lb number="1982"/>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;
    <lb number="1983"/>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
    <lb number="1984"/>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
    <lb number="1985"/>To follow that which flies before her face,
    <lb number="1986"/>Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
    <lb number="1987"/>So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
    <lb number="1988"/>Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
    <lb number="1989"/>But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
    <lb number="1990"/>And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;
    <lb number="1991"/>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    <lb number="1992"/>If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

  <poem>
    <lb number="1993"/>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
    <lb number="1994"/>Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
    <lb number="1995"/>The better angel is a man right fair,
    <lb number="1996"/>The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
    <lb number="1997"/>To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
    <lb number="1998"/>Tempteth my better angel from my side,
    <lb number="1999"/>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
    <lb number="2000"/>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
    <lb number="2001"/>And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
    <lb number="2002"/>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
    <lb number="2003"/>But being both from me, both to each friend,
    <lb number="2004"/>I guess one angel in another's hell:
    <lb number="2005"/>Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    <lb number="2006"/>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2007"/>Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
    <lb number="2008"/>Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
    <lb number="2009"/>To me that languish'd for her sake:
    <lb number="2010"/>But when she saw my woeful state,
    <lb number="2011"/>Straight in her heart did mercy come,
    <lb number="2012"/>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
    <lb number="2013"/>Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
    <lb number="2014"/>And taught it thus anew to greet;
    <lb number="2015"/>'I hate' she alter'd with an end, 
    <lb number="2016"/>That followed it as gentle day,
    <lb number="2017"/>Doth follow night, who like a fiend
    <lb number="2018"/>From heaven to hell is flown away.
    <lb number="2019"/>'I hate', from hate away she threw, 
    <lb number="2020"/>And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.

  <poem>
    <lb number="2021"/>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
    <lb number="2022"/>My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
    <lb number="2023"/>Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
    <lb number="2024"/>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
    <lb number="2025"/>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
    <lb number="2026"/>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
    <lb number="2027"/>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
    <lb number="2028"/>Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
    <lb number="2029"/>Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
    <lb number="2030"/>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
    <lb number="2031"/>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
    <lb number="2032"/>Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    <lb number="2033"/>So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    <lb number="2034"/>And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2035"/>My love is as a fever longing still,
    <lb number="2036"/>For that which longer nurseth the disease;
    <lb number="2037"/>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
    <lb number="2038"/>The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
    <lb number="2039"/>My reason, the physician to my love,
    <lb number="2040"/>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
    <lb number="2041"/>Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
    <lb number="2042"/>Desire is death, which physic did except.
    <lb number="2043"/>Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
    <lb number="2044"/>And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
    <lb number="2045"/>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
    <lb number="2046"/>At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    <lb number="2047"/>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    <lb number="2048"/>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2049"/>O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
    <lb number="2050"/>Which have no correspondence with true sight;
    <lb number="2051"/>Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
    <lb number="2052"/>That censures falsely what they see aright?
    <lb number="2053"/>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
    <lb number="2054"/>What means the world to say it is not so?
    <lb number="2055"/>If it be not, then love doth well denote
    <lb number="2056"/>Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
    <lb number="2057"/>How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
    <lb number="2058"/>That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
    <lb number="2059"/>No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
    <lb number="2060"/>The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    <lb number="2061"/>O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    <lb number="2062"/>Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2063"/>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
    <lb number="2064"/>When I against myself with thee partake?
    <lb number="2065"/>Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
    <lb number="2066"/>Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
    <lb number="2067"/>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
    <lb number="2068"/>On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
    <lb number="2069"/>Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
    <lb number="2070"/>Revenge upon myself with present moan?
    <lb number="2071"/>What merit do I in my self respect,
    <lb number="2072"/>That is so proud thy service to despise,
    <lb number="2073"/>When all my best doth worship thy defect,
    <lb number="2074"/>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    <lb number="2075"/>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    <lb number="2076"/>Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2077"/>O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
    <lb number="2078"/>With insufficiency my heart to sway?
    <lb number="2079"/>To make me give the lie to my true sight,
    <lb number="2080"/>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
    <lb number="2081"/>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
    <lb number="2082"/>That in the very refuse of thy deeds
    <lb number="2083"/>There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
    <lb number="2084"/>That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
    <lb number="2085"/>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
    <lb number="2086"/>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
    <lb number="2087"/>O! though I love what others do abhor,
    <lb number="2088"/>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
    <lb number="2089"/>If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
    <lb number="2090"/>More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2091"/>Love is too young to know what conscience is,
    <lb number="2092"/>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
    <lb number="2093"/>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
    <lb number="2094"/>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
    <lb number="2095"/>For, thou betraying me, I do betray
    <lb number="2096"/>My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
    <lb number="2097"/>My soul doth tell my body that he may
    <lb number="2098"/>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
    <lb number="2099"/>But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
    <lb number="2100"/>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
    <lb number="2101"/>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
    <lb number="2102"/>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    <lb number="2103"/>No want of conscience hold it that I call
    <lb number="2104"/>Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2105"/>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
    <lb number="2106"/>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
    <lb number="2107"/>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
    <lb number="2108"/>In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
    <lb number="2109"/>But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
    <lb number="2110"/>When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
    <lb number="2111"/>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
    <lb number="2112"/>And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
    <lb number="2113"/>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
    <lb number="2114"/>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
    <lb number="2115"/>And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
    <lb number="2116"/>Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    <lb number="2117"/>For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
    <lb number="2118"/>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

  <poem>
    <lb number="2119"/>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
    <lb number="2120"/>A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
    <lb number="2121"/>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
    <lb number="2122"/>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
    <lb number="2123"/>Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
    <lb number="2124"/>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
    <lb number="2125"/>And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
    <lb number="2126"/>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
    <lb number="2127"/>But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
    <lb number="2128"/>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
    <lb number="2129"/>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
    <lb number="2130"/>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    <lb number="2131"/>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    <lb number="2132"/>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <lb number="2133"/>The little Love-god lying once asleep,
    <lb number="2134"/>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
    <lb number="2135"/>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
    <lb number="2136"/>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
    <lb number="2137"/>The fairest votary took up that fire
    <lb number="2138"/>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
    <lb number="2139"/>And so the general of hot desire
    <lb number="2140"/>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
    <lb number="2141"/>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
    <lb number="2142"/>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
    <lb number="2143"/>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
    <lb number="2144"/>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    <lb number="2145"/>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    <lb number="2146"/>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
