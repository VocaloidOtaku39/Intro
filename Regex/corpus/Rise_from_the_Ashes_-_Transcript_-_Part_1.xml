</line><line>Phoenix: <textEffects>(Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema? She got quiet all of a sudden as soon as we arrived.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Guard... I thought I told you I didn't want visitors.
</line><line>Guard:
S-s-s-sorry, ma'am! It's j-j-just, your sister...
</line><line>???:
No excuses! Or did you not want a raise this year, hmm?
</line><line>Guard:
U-u-u-understood, ma'am!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
H-hi, Lana.
</line><line>???:
Funny. I seem to remember specifically telling you NOT to come here. Perhaps my memory is failing?
</line><line>Ema:
L-look... I didn't want to come here either, okay? But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney!
</line><line>???:
I'll be the one in court tomorrow. This has nothing to do with you, Ema. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey! How do you know me?
</line><line>???:
Mia mentioned you. I've heard... quite a bit.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...?
</line><line>???:
My name is Lana, Lana Skye.
</line><line>Lana:
I'm Chief Prosecutor for this district.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-you're a prosecutor!? <textEffects>(Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence? Ema... Lana... I mean, they're just like...)</textEffects>

Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?

Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-excuse me?
</line><line>Lana:
As you can plainly see, I am admitting my guilt. I think it's safe to say... there's no way you can take this case. None.
</line><line>Ema:
B-but, Lana!
</line><line>Lana:
...
</line><line>Ema:
You... you were always this way, weren't you? You never think of anyone
but yourself.
</line><line>Lana:
...!
</line><line>Ema:
I know you didn't do it, Lana, I know! So... So how can you say you did!?

If I lose you... I'll be all alone! I... I hate you, Lana!

... Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes?
</line><line>Lana:
I believe our discussion here is ended. The rest... I leave to you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! Um... you mean, you're requesting my services as your defense?
</line><line>Lana:
Don't lose any sleep over it. Your client has confessed, after all. The case is over.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this.
</line><line>Lana:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Lana has confessed to the crime, yes... But something doesn't fit. It's that look in Ema's eyes. There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out what!)</textEffects>

I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? About what?
</line><line>Ema:
My sister... She's not always like that you know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again.
</line><line>Ema:
She's changed a lot. She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see... <textEffects>(Sorry, but I'm having trouble imagining that.)</textEffects> What happened to her?
</line><line>Ema:
I don't know for certain myself... I think maybe she... Well, maybe not.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific explanation.)</textEffects> Let's go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, shall we?

Hey everyone! Keep up the good work!
</line><line>Phoenix:
H-hey! What are you thinking?
</line><line>Ema:
Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now after all. No harm in saying hello...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't supposed to examine crime scenes? I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see?
</line><line>???:
Hey there! You 'specting to go unnoticed here, pardner?
</line><line>Ema:
P-Pardner?
</line><line>???:
What do we have here? Looks like a bambina got loose from the ranch and is up to no good! Folks gotta learn to keep them dogies tied down, pardner.
</line><line>Ema:
M-Mr. Marshall!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Lookie here, bambina. I know how you feel. But this is my gang's gold strike, see?
</line><line>Ema:
Strike...?
</line><line>???:
This is our claim, our territory. And the goldmine is... evidence. If you're fixin' to mess with what's ours... You'll regret it, pardner! You know what dreams the cacti out in the desert dream? You want to?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's this guy talking about!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
You head along home now. Happy trails, bambina!

See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful?

I guess... Though I don't see what "science" has to do with it.

This area is off limits to anyone without clearance. Especially passers-by. Or are you officers?

Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have clearance.

Well, that's hardly a way to greet someone! Even if my days as the "Cough-up Queen" are over...

C-cough-up? Huh?
</line><line>Ema:
You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch...

I'm quite connected to this case, you see. The images are burned into my eyes, you might say. Yes, all the sordid secrets...
</line><line>Ema:
Secrets...?
</line><line>???:
Dear me. You are a slow one, aren't you? I'm referring to the murder. The stabbing of that detective.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?

<line>Lana:
A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.

Sir! But, but sir! I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! I wasn't aware of the peculiars of your arrangement with us, sir!

As you can see, I'm busy. You may leave now.
</line><line>Ema:
L-let's do as he says, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim was a detective from the same department as that patrolman just now. Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there.

U-uh... Thanks. <textEffects>(He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)</textEffects>

Whew... We're finally here. Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's Office?

That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that bad. This is my first time to the Police Department, actually.&#160;? Hold on, what's that?

Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that?

No, Jake Marshall's just a regular officer... From West LA.
