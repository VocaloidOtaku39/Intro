</line><line>Maya:
Who would've thought something like this would exist underground? This place is totally different from Labyrinthia. It kinda looks like... something straight out of a history book.
</line><line>Layton:
A long-forgotten remnant of the past. It does stir up a desire to explore.
</line><line>Maya:
C'mon, Professor! Let's go explore this place!
</line><line>Layton:
I'm afraid that finding the Great Witch is our utmost priority, Miss Fey.
</line><line>Maya:
Okay! In that case, let's hurry up and catch her so we can do some serious exploration of these ruins!
</line><line>Layton:
Ha ha. Indeed. Archaic ruins are my speciality, after all.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh yeah... I almost forgot you're an archaeologist, Professor.
</line><line>Layton:
...Now then, shall we begin our search?

<center><b>NEW MYSTERY</b>
<b>Ruins in the Forest</b></center>
<line><b>Lying at the end of the secret passage leading from the mansion were some underground ruins lit by pools of water. What is the purpose of these ruins, lying deep within the forest?</b>
<i>As an archaeologist, I have to wonder why a huge underground space such as this was constructed.</i>

<line>Maya:
Hmm. This door won't budge. It looks like it needs a key to open. I betcha the Great Witch is on the other side of this door!
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, that is a possibility, however... there is still another room nearby that we have yet to explore.
</line><line>Maya:
Okay, Professor! We should go check out that other room first, then.
</line>
<center>A new destination has been added to the map: Ruins - Small Room.</center>

<line><i>Ruins - Small Room</i>
</line><line>Maya:
I wonder what this room is? There are stone statues everywhere. Say, Professor... Is it me, or do these statues all look really sad?
</line><line>Layton:
I agree. There is a certain air of sadness to them. They almost seem to be in pain.
</line><line>Maya:
Brrr...they're giving me the chills.
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center><textEffects>...Heh heh...</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh c'mon, Professor! I know being creeped out by statues seems kinda silly, but you don't have to laugh at me!
</line><line>Layton:
...No, Miss Fey. That was not me.
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>So glad you could finally make it, Professor Hershel Layton.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
As I thought. It was you that led us here. Tell us... what secret lies within these ruins?
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Now, now... I think you're capable of journeying to "the Beginning" and finding out the truth all on your own.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
"The Beginning"?
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Have you ever wondered why the Storyteller started writing the Story in the first place...? More importantly... why does he continue to write it...? The answers to those questions are located within these very ruins.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
If that is true, then might I ask why you are sharing this information with us?
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>...Simple. I want you to get closer to the truth. I'm afraid you'll have to work out the rest for yourselves, but I'm sure that's child's play for a gentleman of your calibre.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
What exactly are you plotting?
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>When the light of truth shines upon the hidden darkness of the First Story, the legendary figure will rise... The Great Witch Bezella!</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
...Huh? B-but... you're Bezella...aren't you?!
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Heh heh... Me? Bezella? I hate to disappoint you, but you've got the wrong person.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Maya:
Yeah, but! The Shades were calling you the "Great Witch"...
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>Ah yes...they did indeed call me by such a name. However... that was for an entirely different reason.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
...I'm afraid she is correct, Miss Fey. This person is not Bezella.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Layton:
The real Bezella would never expose herself so freely. It would place her in far too much danger. It would be tantamount to turning herself in. Also...there was something very strange about those Shades in the forest.
</line><line>Maya:
Strange...?
</line><line>Layton:
One must wonder...why they would consider her the Great Witch when there is no magic present here...
</line><line>Maya:
Ah... Th-that's true... So much has happened so far...but none of it was related to any magic...
</line><line>Layton:
When we met in the Eldwitch Woods, and even now... you had something you wanted us to find. If you were truly Bezella, there would be no reason for you to lead us along in such a manner.
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>That is correct. I am not Bezella... Rather, I actually wish to meet with Bezella. And that moment will soon come to pass...</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
............
</line><line>The Great Witch:
</line>
<center><textEffects>The truth lies with your cute new friend... Until we meet again...</textEffects></center>
<line>
Layton:
...! Please, wait! We're not finished yet...
</line><line>Maya:
............ ...I can't hear her voice any more. I think she's gone...
</line><line>Layton:
...It would appear so.
</line><line>Maya:
That witch...wasn't Bezella after all, huh?
</line><line>Layton:
It would seem our "Great Witch" has been demoted to a mere "witch".
</line><line>Maya:
Aw, man...and here I thought we finally managed to catch Bezella.
</line><line>Layton:
Remember what she said, Miss Fey. When we find the truth, we will find Bezella.
</line><line>Maya:
Say, Professor... When we do find the real Bezella... do you think this will finally be over? I mean, everything... The witch trials, that fake fire pit... Do you think it'll all finally come to an end?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, I do. Bezella is at the root of all disaster in Labyrinthia. If we catch her, then everything should come to an end.
</line><line>Maya:
...Then we know what we've gotta do. Let's go, Professor! Maybe there's a clue or two around in these ruins somewhere!
</line><line>Layton:
Of course. We cannot afford to stop just yet. Let us move on, Miss Fey.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh? I wonder what that sparkly thing was just now....
</line><line>Layton:
Oh, something seems to have fallen. Hmm...it appears to be a key.
</line><line>Maya:
You think the witch dropped it?
</line><line>Layton:
Judging by the patterns on this key, it would appear to have some sort of connection to these ruins.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah! It definitely does! Remember that HUGE door back near the entrance? I bet it's related to that door... My spirit medium's instinct is never wrong!
</line><line>Layton:
S-spirit medium's instinct, you say? Well then, let us head back and check.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah! But, y'know...that witch must be pretty absent-minded to just drop her key like that. That's something Nick would do!
</line><line>Layton:
I'm not sure that's entirely the case. Perhaps...she intended to drop it here.
</line><line>Maya:
Really? But why would she do that?
</line><line>Layton:
So we can continue to move deeper inside the ruins, naturally.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh. You mean...she's trying to lead us to "the Beginning"?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, precisely.
</line><line>Maya:
Boy, she really wants us to find this "truth", huh...whatever that may be.
</line><line>Layton:
We could not have asked for a better clue... Even if there is an ulterior motive behind it. If it is the truth she would like us to find, then we must be prepared to face it.
</line><line>Maya:
All right! Hold on to your hat, Professor! Because "The Order of the English Gentleman and Feisty Spirit Medium" is coming through!
</line><line>Layton:
Ha ha. A most...ambitious title if there ever was one... Let us head to the entrance, Miss Fey!

<center><b>MYSTERY SOLVED</b>
<b>Witches in London</b></center>
<line><b>The witch that captured Espella in London, and who turned the professor into gold, is the "Great Witch", who leads the Shades in the Eldwitch Woods.</b>
<i>This so-called Great Witch was not, in fact, Bezella. I feel as if she is trying to nudge me into ascertaining something.</i>

<line><i>Great Witch's Abode</i>
</line><line>Luke:
...Wright... Mr Wright... We made it outside. The coast looks clear!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ow... Sheesh, my back is killing me.
</line><line>Espella:
I think that elderly woman has left for a break now. To be honest, I was a little nervous there for a second.
</line><line>Luke:
By the way, where are we? Espella, do you know?
</line><line>Espella:
No... I've never seen this place before. There isn't a forest like this anywhere in Labyrinthia...
</line><line>Luke:
We must have travelled quite a distance...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Um, did you guys see that just now?!
</line><line>Luke:
Huh?
</line><line>Espella:
My...I wonder who that is. That's quite an odd outfit they have on.
</line><line>Luke:
Right then! How about I go over and ask where we are?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait...are you serious? But...they're wearing such weird outfits...
</line><line>Luke:
Now, Mr Wright. You mustn't judge a book by its cover!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, you're right. What was I thinking...?
</line>

<line>Luke:
Um, excuse me! Could you perhaps tell us where we are?
</line><line>Shade:
This is...Eldwitch Woods... An outside world that exists away from "the Story". An empty world... A world with no official existence... A world unwritten in the annals of history...
</line><line>Phoenix:
An "outside world"...?
</line><line>Luke:
Eldwitch Woods...?
</line><line>Shade:
All who dwell in these woods live as Shades, each bound to their tasks.
</line><line>Luke:
Wh-what do you mean by their "tasks"?
</line><line>Shade:
............ Could it be? Are you... Are you new recruits? Why haven't you attended the Great Witch's orientation ritual?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-the Great Witch...?
</line><line>Shade:
......
</line><line>Luke:
I can't help but feel he's giving us the most disapproving looks right now!
</line><line>Shade:
You...you must see her right away! We exist...to carry out our tasks... Nothing more...
</line><line>Luke:
H-hey! Wait... ...He's gone. Well that was strange...
</line><line>Espella:
Could that have been...?
</line><line>Luke:
...? Do you know what that was about, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
There is a fairy tale that is often told to the children in Labyrinthia...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What kind of fairy tale?
</line><line>Espella:
It's a story about a secret forest where the souls of witches sentenced to burn in the flames wander around.
</line><line>Luke:
A secret...forest...
</line><line>Espella:
Those souls cannot be seen by the living, and they say anyone who is able to see them...is possessed by the evil spirit.
</line><line>Luke:
A forest of wandering souls...?
</line><line>Espella:
Maybe this is the forest mentioned in that story...
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but, I mean... it's just a kid's fairy tale, right?
</line><line>Luke:
If that story is true... does that mean the person we just spoke to was a witch's spirit?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no way... Wait, hold on... Remember how we got here? We came through that cage in the fire pit, all the way down here. Which means... I think there's a very good chance that witches are connected to this forest. <textEffects>(And...if I'm right, that means a certain someone must be here somewhere... We're coming for you, Maya!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Luke:
We should go check out the forest, then. Mr Wright! Espella! I hope you're ready!
</line><line>Espella:
Mmm, yes. Maybe we'll find clues as to Maya's whereabouts.
</line><line>Luke:
...Yeah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, guys. Let's get going already. Our first stop... is that creepy-looking "haunted house" up ahead.

</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what is this place...?
</line><line>Espella:
It looks like a workshop of some sort. I wonder what's being mixed inside those cauldrons...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, maybe it's a witch's potion...?
</line><line>Luke:
*sniff* Hey...do you smell that? Do you think it's coming from the liquid inside? I feel...like I've smelled this scent before.
</line><line>Espella:
Umm, Luke? I don't think it's a good idea to breathe in too much of this scent. That's probably why all those people are wearing masks.
</line><line>Luke:
Wha...?! Do you think...they could be wearing gas masks...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhh... So...this room could possibly be a little more than hazardous to our health, huh? I think we'd better move on for now... I think my sinuses are stuffy...*sniff*
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Wright, look! There's another door on the other side of the room! And it looks like there's no toxic gas there!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I don't know if I'd call it "toxic" just yet. Anyway, we need to proceed with our search, so let's go.

<line><i>Great Witch's Room</i>
</line><line>Espella:
Ahhhh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I-is that...BLOOD?!
</line><line>Luke:
The room is covered with it. What could have happened here?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... No, wait. This doesn't seem to be blood...
</line><line>Luke:
...Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There... *sniff* You smell that? It smells like that liquid they're making in the room back there.
</line><line>Luke:
You know, now that you've mentioned it... I think this is that liquid.
</line><line>Espella:
Oh, thank goodness. So that probably means no one was hurt here, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I guess not. Still...something clearly happened here.
</line><line>Luke:
Huh...? Mr Wright, Espella... Look over there... Is that...a secret passage behind the chandelier?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hey, good eye, Luke! I wonder where it leads...
</line><line>Luke:
It...looks pitch black in there... So, um...should we go inside?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Of course. We're on an investigation, aren't we?
</line><line>Luke:
R-right...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's this? Luke, are you scared?
</line><line>Luke:
You've got it all wrong! I'm perfectly fine in the dark! No problems at all! Right then. I-I'll be right behind you, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yup. He's scared.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
U-um... I'm right behind you as well, Mr Wright!

<line><i>Ruins - Waterway</i>
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wow... Who'd have thought there'd be some ancient underground ruins here...
</line><line>Espella:
Wow... This place is amazing, isn't it? Look at those large pillars and that stream of water... Everything here looks so old. I've never seen anything quite like it. And you say this kind of place is called a "roo-in", is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, yeah... I guess you don't really have any ancient ruins like this within Labyrinthia, huh?
</line><line>Luke:
Ancient ruins...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Something wrong, Luke?
</line><line>Luke:
It's just... This reminds me of the professor... If he were here, he could tell us anything we wanted to know about these ruins.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, that's right...the professor was an archaeologist.
</line><line>Luke:
Yeah... Sometimes I can almost hear the professor's kind words calling out... Even now...I can almost hear his voice... *sniff*... Professor...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me too... I can almost hear the professor's voice... And Maya's, too...
</line><line>Espella:
I-I think I hear them as well...
</line><line>Luke:
Um...come to think of it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It really is like...
</line><line>Espella:
We can actually...
</line><line>Luke:
Hear them...
</line><line>...What?!
</line><line>???:
Now then...let's...check over on that side...
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>...Professor...over here...</center>
<line>
Luke:
...! Th-those voices just now! It has to be...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... Th-there's no mistaking it...
</line><line>Luke:
Professor! PROFESSOR!
</line><line>Layton:
Luke! What are you doing here?
</line><line>Luke:
P-Professor! It...it's really you! I-I...I thought...you'd never come back... Even though deep down I believed the spell could be broken somehow...there were times I just wasn't sure it was possible. *sob* Professor...
</line><line>Layton:
...I'm so sorry, my boy. I've caused you quite a bit of worry.
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Professor! You're all right! Um...Professor, what about Maya...? I...uhh...thought I heard her voice, too...
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, yes. Not to worry, Mr Wright. Rest assured Miss Fey is just-
</line><line>Maya:
YOOOOOOOOO, NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!  Hey, Nick! Niiiiiiick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya! Am I dreaming? Is it really you?!
</line><line>Maya:
Yup, yup! The professor and I are as real as real can be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have no idea how relieved I am. Really. I've never been so happy to see you!
</line><line>Maya:
I, uh...I'm really sorry, Nick. You must've been worried sick. It's just... Well, I wanted to do something to help Espella, you know?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, no! It's not your fault, Maya. It's mine. If only I'd helped you sooner... then none of this would've happened... And you wouldn't... have been dropped into that pit of fire!
</line><line>Maya:
I...*sniff* I thought I'd never see you again, Nick. I...I'm really sorry.
</line><line>Layton:
Come now. Everyone here did the best that they could. That is what enabled us to power through the hardship and reunite. That is what I believe.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, you're right, Professor.
</line><line>Luke:
Right you are, Professor!
</line><line>Maya:
Good old Professor Layton logic! Logic so good...it'll leave you good as gold, right, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Ha ha. Indeed, Miss Fey.
</line><line>Espella:
I'm so glad you're all okay. Um...Maya! Are you hurt?! Are you suffering from any burns? And Professor! Has your arm been properly reattached to your body?!
</line><line>Layton:
We're quite all right, Espella, I assure you. You may rest easy.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah! Look! We're perfectly fine.
</line><line>Espella:
Oh, thank goodness...
</line><line>Maya:
Espella...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Phew. Espella looks super relieved...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
We're entirely unharmed, Espella. Please, dry your tears.
</line><line>Maya:
Look what you started, Nick! Everyone got all sappy and now you made Espella cry!
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Wright! A gentleman must never, ever make a lady cry!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-why is it MY fault...?
</line><line>Espella:
Hee hee... Thank you, everyone.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright. You kept those two safe and out of harm's way. For that, you have my utmost gratitude.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no problem, Professor! I honestly couldn't have done it on my own. Luke and Espella really helped me when I needed it the most. Likewise, I should be thanking you for keeping Maya safe. Thank you so much.
</line><line>Layton:
Not at all, Mr Wright. After all, it is a gentleman's duty to help a lady in need.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick, you should really learn to be a proper gentleman, like the professor here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?! W-well... I'm not too sure I'd be able to pull off the whole top hat look, for one...
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, it is an honour to once again team up with you. No matter what challenges may lie in our way, with your help I am certain we can overcome them. Let us go forth and solve the mystery that is Labyrinthia, shall we?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Absolutely. We'll fight for Espella until the very end. Professor, I'm looking forward to working with you and putting an end to this mystery once and for all!
</line><line>Layton:
It will be my pleasure, Mr Wright.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
Hmm, I see. So that is what happened to Miss Kira...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. That's why I think there's more to the witch trials than meets the eye.
</line><line>Maya:
Ah ha! So you figured out there was something fishy with that fire pit. The patented "Nick Investigation Method"! Dive head-first into a pit and figure out it's not really a pit after all. Proven and tested!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Boy, thanks. Anyway, that was how we ended up here. So...what about that "Great Witch" you said you ran into?
</line><line>Layton:
We still do not know much about her. However, it seems she was the one responsible for leading us here. She also told us of a place containing many secrets regarding the Storyteller's Story. A place she refers to as "the Beginning".
</line><line>Espella:
"The Beginning"... You're saying...my father's secrets are hidden there?
</line><line>Layton:
As I suspected. You have never heard of this place, correct?
</line><line>Espella:
That's right. This is also the first time I've ever seen these ruins. ...I think everything will be made clear when we get there. Labyrinthia... Even the Great Witch...
</line><line>Layton:
It is as the Great Witch said it would be.
</line><line>Espella:
............ It's a bit scary, to be honest.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Espella:
I feel as if... getting to the bottom of all this and exposing Labyrinthia's secrets...will change everything. Knowing my father's secrets...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Espella...
</line><line>Espella:
I think the old me would be absolutely terrified right now. She probably couldn't even go on. But...I must stay strong. I must know the truth. I've been so blind to the truth this entire time. Because of you all... I'm finally able to see the world for what it really is! That's why I want to go along with you!
</line><line>Layton:
We're all in this together!
</line><line>Maya:
Woo! Get ready, Espella! This is going to be an adventure you'll never forget!
</line><line>Espella:
Okay, Maya!
</line><line>Layton:
I believe that large door on the other side of the room should lead us further inside.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... In that case...
</line><line>Luke:
We should investigate immediately, right, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, that's right. I must say, I have not seen you so excited in quite a while, my boy.
</line><line>Luke:
R-really? Heh heh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's because he's just itching to get to solving some puzzles with you, Professor.
</line><line>Layton:
Ha ha. Then we should not delay. Let's investigate that large gate ahead.
</line>

<line>Luke:
Huh? That's weird. There's no handle. It doesn't look like we'll be able to pull or push the door open.
</line><line>Espella:
Oh! Look. It looks like there's a keyhole.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But...we don't have a key.
</line><line>Maya:
Heh heh heh. Nick, what would you do without me? Zvarri! The professor and I found this back in the side-room over there!
</line><line>Layton:
It appears this key belongs to this door.
</line><line>Maya:
Now, watch as "Maya the Magnificent" works her magic and opens the door! Please, hold your applause... ...Take that! ............Huh?
</line><line>Layton:
What seems to be the matter, Miss Fey?
</line><line>Maya:
What gives?! This key won't work. Maybe it's a fake...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I like how your first instinct is to think the key is fake, instead of just belonging to another door.
</line><line>Layton:
Let us not hastily jump to any conclusions. Look closely here. It appears this key...is part of a puzzle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
R-right... A puzzle, you say?
</line><line>Layton:
It would seem our progression will not be as easy as we thought.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right, then. If it's a puzzle that needs solving, that's your cue, Professor!
</line><line>Layton:
Not quite, Mr Wright. This puzzle requires your particular expertise.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, m-me?!
</line><line>Layton:
Your unique way of thinking may be crucial to finding the solution. Do not worry, you will do fine. Remember, you have seen many different kinds of puzzles during our time here in Labyrinthia. I believe you are now well prepared for tackling any number of puzzles that may come your way.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not exactly sure that's true, but... if there are any contradictions in this puzzle, I'll do my very best to point them out!
</line>

<line>Luke:
Hmm... This key just won't turn! It gets stuck halfway through!
</line><line>Espella:
It's like Maya said. There must be some special way of unlocking it...
</line><line>Maya:
Heh heh heh... You just need to flip your way of thinking, that's all. It could be that we just need to flip the key, too!
</line><line>Espella:
That's it, Maya! The "key" is in how you hold the key. Let's give it another shot!
</line>

<line>Luke:
Huh? It's still not working? But we've tried everything... It just won't open.
</line><line>Espella:
There must be some other way the key fits into the keyhole.
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm. Perhaps it would be wise to re-evaluate our way of thinking.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Boy... This is like the puzzle to end all puzzles...
</line><line>Maya:
C'mon, Nick! Quit your whining! Where's that ace attorney spirit?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who's whining?! Anyways... Maybe we should try a little courtroom thinking on this one.
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
...So, the problem is that we haven't been able to figure out what we have to do past this point.
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm? Have you spotted something, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh, yeah... You could say that. I think we've been thinking about this all wrong... That's why we haven't been able to see the "true nature" of this puzzle.
</line><line>Layton:
Excellent, Mr Wright. Let us clear our heads and give it another go, shall we?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"The 'key' to proceeding is in the key"... This must have something to do with the true nature of the key itself.
</line>
<center>What is the secret to using the key?</center>



<line>Phoenix:
The true nature of this puzzle... lies in the very key itself! Take a closer look at the key. Notice the small gaps all around? We just have to move this and... There! The "key" to the key! So what do we do now? Professor, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. These pieces appear to fit into something. It's a puzzle within a puzzle.
</line><line>Luke:
A puzzle within a... Hey! Mr Wright! That must mean the area around the keyhole is...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. The pieces are the key and the space around the "keyhole" is the real keyhole!
</line>

Maya:
Whoa! That was awesome, Nick! Who'd have thought the key would have a completely different form?
</line><line>Luke:
Now that's what I call thinking outside the box, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Espella:
Now we'll be able to continue through the ruins, and it's all thanks to you, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, ha ha... I don't really think I did all that much, though.
</line><line>Layton:
You have my thanks as well, Mr Wright. Such a...unique skill as yours is no small feat, I assure you. With our combined efforts, I am confident we can get to the bottom of the mysteries clouding Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Absolutely, Professor. ...You know, it's been a good while since we were last able to team up.
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. Unfortunately, I've been a little less animate than usual of late.
</line><line>Maya:
But hey! It all worked out in the end. And it's all thank to the professor's <textEffects>golden arm</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, but still... the only reason we even got his arm back was because that pawnbroker returned it. We got really lucky, that's for sure.
</line><line>Layton:
Did you say my arm was returned by a pawnbroker, Mr Wright? If I may ask...what is the particular story behind that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-don't worry about it, Professor! It's probably best if we just keep on moving.
</line><line>Luke:
Y-yes! Good idea, Mr Wright! Let's go, Professor!
</line>

<line><i>Ruins - Sealed Way</i>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what? There's...fire in those statues...
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm. It would appear we've stumbled upon yet another very elaborate mechanism here.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Luke! Espella! Check this out! Those plants are glowing!
</line><line>Luke:
Um, Maya, that's actually luminous moss! Even though the moss looks like it's glowing in the dark... it's actually reflecting the light from its surroundings. Its unique cells are responsible for the mysterious green colour.
</line><line>Espella:
So, it's actually reflecting light? I must say, that was an incredibly detailed explanation, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
Of course! I am the professor's apprentice, after all!
</line><line>Maya:
Luke, check this out. If you poke the moss, it totally makes your finger glow! I say we try a little experiment. Stay still. I'm gonna put a whole bunch of moss all over you... that way you'll be as "bright" as the professor!
</line><line>Luke:
N-no! That's not funny! Please put down that clump of moss, Maya!
</line><line>Espella:
Hee hee.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Looks like the tension level just took a big drop, huh?
</line><line>Layton:
I think it is about time we saw some smiling faces, wouldn't you agree, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, definitely. Having the whole gang together again is reason enough to smile, all right.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, let's give them some space and explore on ahead ourselves for the time being.

<line>Phoenix:
Professor, it looks like there are letters of some sort etched into this stone slate.
</line><line>Layton:
This...would appear to be some kind of ancient script.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh... A real shame we can't read it.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, surely you remember my occupation, do you not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um... O-oh, yeah! You said you're...an archaeologist, right? Then that means you can actually read it?
</line><line>Layton:
I cannot say for certain, but I will do my best to see what I can decode. Give me one moment.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So the professor is an archaeologist trying to uncover the secrets of magic... Sounds like something out of a movie...
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, Nick...what are you and the professor doing over there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We found some ancient writing on this stone slate. The professor is attempting to decipher it right now, so keep your voice down.
</line><line>Maya:
That's so cool. In a really sciency, geeky kinda way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Hey, where are Espella and Luke?
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, them? They're over by the water trying to wash all the moss off Luke.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you must have had something to do with that, Maya...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
My apologies for the wait... I have managed to decipher the script.
</line><line>Maya:
Wow! Amazing, Professor! So? So? Don't keep us waiting! What's it say? Is it a clue about witches and magic? Or maybe it's Bezella's secret evil plans for taking over Labyrinthia?
</line><line>Layton:
...I am afraid not, Miss Fey. This slate... appears to be a warning.
</line><line>Luke:
A...warning, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes. Allow me to read it aloud:
</line>
<center>Heed these words, those who enter through these gates of destruction. Do not proceed any further. Or you will soon find yourself haunted with memories most terrifying. When this gate is opened and the dreaded sound heard once more throughout... the calamity shall befall us once again. The inner sanctum has been locked with the Three Seals. The first is the Seal of Leviathan. Second is the Seal of Despair. The third is the Seal of Sages. Leave these seals in peace or face the dire consequences. Heed this warning well.</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
C-"calamity"...?
</line><line>Espella:
...Haunted with memories most terrifying...
</line><line>Maya:
Do you think it means...Bezella? If we continue on to "the Beginning", will we end up finding the real Bezella?
</line><line>Layton:
Going strictly by what we've read so far, I would say that is the most likely scenario.
</line><line>Espella:
But Bezella is the one responsible for the appearance of witches and all the other misfortunes we've seen so far... Yet, what's written on this slate seems to say the opposite. It's almost like Bezella was actually sealed away.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And long ago, someone must have been able to break that seal and release her. That would explain why Bezella is on the loose again.
</line><line>Maya:
G-guys, what should we do?
</line><line>Luke:
......
</line><line>Layton:
......
</line><line>Phoenix:
......
</line><line>Espella:
...I say we go on.
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
Didn't we all agree that we would seek out the truth no matter what? If that's the case, then we cannot just turn back now.
</line><line>Layton:
...Right you are, Espella. We cannot abandon our duty and turn back. Although the road ahead may be fraught with danger... it is unlikely that we will have another opportunity like this to find out the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. We only have until the start of the parade. That doesn't give us much time. We have to find some decisive clues here!
</line><line>Espella:
...Like finding out who released Bezella from her prison.
</line><line>Maya:
All right then, it's settled. C'mon, guys, let's saddle up!
</line><line>Luke:
Too right! Let's get going.
</line><line>Layton:
First is the Seal of Leviathan... I believe it may be referring to this very river. Perhaps we can find a clue somewhere nearby.
</line>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Maya:
Hey...there's something under the water. It looks like a stone path.
</line><line>Layton:
You're right, Maya. But it doesn't look safe to cross with that current.
</line><line>Luke:
You don't think we could somehow raise those platforms up and use them to get across, do you?
</line><line>Layton:
............ ...Well done, my boy. It would seem we have discovered another puzzle. I believe these "seals" mentioned in the text are actually puzzles.
</line><line>Espella:
Um... Professor, would it be all right if I gave this puzzle a try?
</line><line>Luke:
No need to worry, Espella. The professor will get us across in no time!
</line><line>Espella:
B-but... I want to do my part and help out, too! Please let me help out! I MUST REPAY YOUR KINDNESS!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Espella...
</line><line>Espella:
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout just now.
</line><line>Layton:
No need to apologise. You've made your feelings quite clear, Espella. And for that, you have my thanks. Now then, we shall leave this puzzle to you. I know you will be successful.
</line><line>Espella:
O-okay! Thank you so much! I won't let you down, Professor!
</line>

<line>
Luke:
Amazing, Espella! You raised the platforms!
</line><line>Espella:
I really did it, didn't I?
</line><line>Layton:
That was quite remarkable, Espella. Extremely well done.
</line><line>Maya:
I knew you could do it, Espella!
</line><line>Layton:
The civilization that once existed here must have been quite advanced considering the mechanisms used on these platforms. I cannot help but wonder what became of them...
</line><line>Luke:
I bet there will be a clue to that somewhere up ahead, Professor!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
So this must be...the Seal of Despair.
</line><line>Maya:
...Y'know, it's probably best we DON'T look down that bottomless pit. Not unless you want a one-way trip into darkness.
</line><line>Layton:
...As I thought. This, too, is a puzzle.
</line><line>Luke:
Leave it to me, Professor!
</line><line>Maya:
Uh-uh! This bad boy is all mine!
</line><line>Layton:
Well, now, it seems you've both gained some of Espella's spirit. In that case, how about you both tackle this puzzle together? I'm sure you two will solve it marvellously.
</line><line>Luke:
All right!
</line><line>Maya:
Just leave it to us!
</line>

<line>
Luke:
We did it! We fixed the bridge! Now we can go on to the last seal!
</line><line>Maya:
Okay, time to focus! Just keep staring straight ahead, and whatever you do, DON'T LOOK DOWN!
</line><line>Phoenix:
J-just make sure you don't go jumping around on that thing... I don't think my heart could take it.
</line><line>Luke:
But, Mr Wright. It's really nice and sturdy. Look!
</line><line>Phoenix:
AAAAAAHHHHH! C-cut that out, Luke! Seriously, you're gonna give me a heart attack!
</line><line>Espella:
Hee hee. They're so full of energy, aren't they, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
That they are, Espella. Keeping our spirits up will bode well for our investigation. Come, the last seal is just up ahead.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Luke:
This is the final one, right?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. The gates of destruction will open once the Seal of Sages is broken... It seems our turn has come, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?! Oh, y-yes. I've been really looking forward to this, Professor.
</line><line>Maya:
...That "HUH?!" didn't exactly scream "I can't wait to do this puzzle", Nick.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Would you hush up?!
</line><line>Espella:
Hey, take a look at those two square recesses in that pedestal. It looks like they're here for some purpose. I wonder what it could be?
</line><line>Layton:
This is a puzzle that cannot be solved by one person alone. I believe we must combine our strength if we are to have any hope of opening that door. How fitting that the final seal should present us with such a formidable challenge. Mr Wright, I have no doubt that together we can solve this puzzle. Shall we begin?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm ready when you are, Professor! <textEffects>(The professor is a puzzle-solving expert. I just hope I don't slip up too much...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
Luke:
...! Did you hear that just now? The door's opening!
</line><line>Maya:
Woo! Way to go! I knew you guys could do it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whew... Glad we got past that one. I wonder what's on the other side of this door...
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, it certainly is intriguing, Mr Wright. We do not know what might await us on the other side of that door.
</line><line>Espella:
It's all right. I'm not scared. We've come so far and we must continue. We must find out what's behind all of this. Let's do it. Let's move forward!
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>The Altar Room</i>
</line><line>Layton:
This room...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like...a shrine of some sort.
</line><line>Espella:
It certainly is very beautiful. That light is almost unearthly... It seems quite unfitting that this place should be associated with destruction, doesn't it?
</line><line>Luke:
It's not like the rest of the ruins at all... It's actually really well preserved.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hm... I wonder if someone else came here before us.
</line><line>Maya:
...C'mon, guys. I think we can relax a bit. Especially after that puzzle that almost made Nick pass out. Y'know, I honestly thought Bezella would come charging at us the second we opened the door and turn us all into frogs.
</line><line>Luke:
Maya... You're starting to give me the creeps...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So it, uhh...looks like Bezella's a no-show, huh?
</line><line>Layton:
...I suggest we scour the room for any potential clues.
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
What's up with this pedestal? It looks a bit strange. It looks like something is missing...
</line><line>Layton:
It would appear something quite large once stood here. Perhaps an object of worship.
</line><line>Maya:
Something large...?
</line><line>Luke:
Ah...look up there! Above the shrine...
</line><line>Espella:
What's that? It looks like there are <textEffects>marks</textEffects> all over the wall.
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm... Whatever was on this pedestal must have been even larger than I originally thought.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It seems whatever it was has been taken away for some reason. I wonder why...
</line><line>Layton:
The inscription on this stone plaque could perhaps offer us a clue. Although... I'm afraid the words in this inscription are somewhat ancient.
</line><line>Maya:
So...you can't read it what it says?
</line><line>Layton:
It would be quite a different story if I were able to take this relic back to London for analysis. As it stands now, however...I may only be able to decipher a portion of it.
</line><line>Luke:
Really, Professor?! What does it say?
</line><line>Layton:
............ It seems as if the previous inhabitants of these ruins were responsible for this inscription... While the inscription itself would appear to provide yet another mystery to be solved. ...Allow me to read it aloud.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
...The former inhabitants of these ruins created <textEffects>a bell out of pure silver</textEffects> as a tribute to the gods they worshipped here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So they made a giant silver bell... <textEffects>(That's actually pretty impressive.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Layton:
However, when the bell was rung, it did not summon a god, but instead, an <textEffects>evil demon</textEffects>. This evil demon...brought up on this world <textEffects>a great catastrophe</textEffects>, causing considerable damage to the land.
</line><line>Maya:
Did you say..."a great catastrophe"? Wh-what could have happened?
</line><line>Layton:
Those that survived the incident dubbed it the "Bell of Ruin" and sealed it within this very room. They then fled in fear of the curse placed upon this land by the demon. The inscription contains one final warning.
</line>
<center>To those who have gained entry into this sanctum, heed our words. You must not ring the Bell of Ruin.</center>
<line>
Layton:
...That is as much as I can gather. I believe the object that was removed from this shrine...was the very Bell of Ruin mentioned in the inscription.
</line><line>Luke:
Professor, could this have anything to do with Bezella?
</line><line>Layton:
...I cannot say for sure, Luke. After all, demons and witches are two very different concepts. However, perhaps there is a chance that the two are connected in origin, through this legend.
</line>
<center>You've learned about the Bell of Ruin.</center>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
"Origin", Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Think back to what was written. What followed the great catastrophe?
</line><line>Maya:
...You must mean the "<textEffects>curse</textEffects> placed upon this land" part, right?
</line><line>Layton:
I imagine that when the bell was rung, it must have summoned "something".
</line><line>Espella:
What sort of curse could that have been? And...what was this "<textEffects>great catastrophe</textEffects>" brought upon by the demon? W-wait... Could it be...
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Espella:
...The fire that destroyed the entire town?
</line>
<center>...Remember...</center>
<line>
Espella:
Huh...?
</line><line>Maya:
Espella, what's wrong?
</line><line>Espella:
Ah... No, no. Nothing's wrong.
</line><line>Maya:
Are you sure? You don't have to put on a brave face for us. Tell us if you're not feeling good, okay?
</line><line>Espella:
Y-yes, of course...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But this still has me wondering... What exactly was the "catastrophe" that happened a long time ago?
</line><line>Luke:
I can only think of one thing in Labyrinthia that could be called a "catastrophe"... the Legendary Fire.
</line><line>Layton:
Of course... Both the Bell of Ruin and the legend of Bezella must be...
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line><line>Maya:
Espella, are you absolutely sure you're feeling okay? Your face has gone really pale...
</line><line>Espella:
...The Legendary...Fire...
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>...Do you remember now, Espella...?</center>
<line>
Espella:
...Wh-who are you...?
</line><line>???:

She took off running when we tried to calm her down. We tried going after her, but she lost us... We searched everywhere for her. The ruins, the forest... But... there was no sign of her, no matter where we looked. We thought she might have returned to town. And if she did... the knights would be sure to catch her and drag her back to that terrifying courtroom... Needless to say, we went back to town straight away to search for her. And then, without warning... Labyrinthia was hit by a heavy rainstorm. There was an ominous silence over the entire town square... The only thing I could hear was the rain.
