Phoenix:
I'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew. After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me... somehow!

Edgeworth:
Wright... Are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? You still look a little green in the face.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Or maybe "viridian", in artist-speak.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
How's your temperature now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Another sword</textEffects>, huh...)</span>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Don't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that is...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Our client's background, naturally.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You mean Iris, sir...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have the feeling that we've met before.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Guess I should get moving, too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why? Do you need to be somewhere?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But don't you worry, pal! As soon as it's all set, you'll be the first to know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough*
</line><line>Gumshoe:
No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Hang in there, Maya. We'll get you out. I promise. But in the meantime... I've got to continue collecting evidence!)</textEffects>

</line><line>von Karma:
"Whip a dead horse!" Isn't that one of your American sayings?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, it's not! And I'm not on the brink of anything.
</line><line>Butz:
Come on, Nick. Tell her, would you? She must model for my picture book, "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash: Simple &amp; Magnificent"! Gaaah!
</line><line>von Karma:
Before you ask me to model, learn to give at least semi-coherent testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And before that, you'll have to learn how to live a semi-coherent life, Larry.
</line><line>Butz:
... I don't care what anyone says! I'm telling the truth! I saw what I saw! She flew, I'm telling you! Whooosh! Just like that dude with the red underwear! Don't think I'm gonna forgive you guys when you come crawling back to apologize!
</line><line>Phoenix:

Phoenix Wright, it's been a year since we last met. A pleasure to see you again.

Sister. Please, leave the investigation to me.

I am on your side. I won't do anything you don't want me to.

I was so lonely, I thought I was going to die! When I woke up in the morning and saw that Dusky Bridge was gone... I... I realized I was all alone.

I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here.

You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year.
</line><line>von Karma:
Well...

I... I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip!

...!

Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you!

Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything!

You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away!

P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here.
</line><line>von Karma:
Prosecutor?
</line><line>Phoenix:
How come you didn't show up at the trial today?
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so...
</line><line>Godot:
I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding.
</line><line>von Karma:
Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial?
</line><line>Godot:
... Who's the wild mare, Trite?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today.
</line><line>Godot:
Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins.
</line><line>von Karma:
Just who do you think you are!? This case is my...

Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home!

Wh-What!?

You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo.

H-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK?

Huh? A kind of... garden-like garden.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A garden?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me?

</line><line>von Karma:
We haven't seen her.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross...

No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth.

Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake.
</line><line>von Karma:
Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple.
</line><line>Bikini:
It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... "Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them."
</line><line>Phoenix:
Someone was trying to destroy the <textEffects>main family line</textEffects>?
</line><line>Bikini:
There is only one heir to the title of "Master" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the <textEffects>main family</textEffects>.

That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.

<line>Phoenix:
Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder!

That's... very impressive, Mr. Wright.
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>

The acolyte's actual training was due to start after 10 o'clock that night. I left the Main Hall early, so I wouldn't be late.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What time was that?
</line><line>Iris:
Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I'm sorry, Iris, but lying just doesn't suit you.
</line><line>Iris:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Now, you say you left the Main Hall at 9:40 PM, but what you say doesn't add up with this!</textEffects>

</line><line>Iris:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's time you told me exactly what's been going on, Iris.

<line>Phoenix:
On the night of the incident, you were seen in <textEffects>two different places</textEffects> at the same time. Which means, there must have been <textEffects>two of you</textEffects>. I can't think of any other explanation, Iris.
</line><line>Iris:
B-But that's crazy! How could that be!? There's only one of me! It's impossible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Impossible? I wonder... The way you're trembling certainly seems to suggest otherwise.
</line><line>Iris:
*gulp* You're seriously trying to suggest there's more than one of me? <textEffects>Then show me the evidence! Show me something that proves there is more than one of me!</textEffects>

... I had no idea you knew of her. Very impressive, Mr. Wright. But... She's no longer...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I know. Her sentence was carried out recently, wasn't it...?
</line><line>Iris:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry.
</line><line>Iris:
Thank you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no need to explain now, is there Iris? This "<textEffects>second you</textEffects>" who was here at the temple on the night of the murder... ...it was your twin sister, <textEffects>Dahlia Hawthorne</textEffects>!
</line><line>Iris:
B-But you just said it yourself a second ago! My sister's dead! Have you forgotten that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Have you forgotten this, Iris? This is a channeling dojo, a training ground of the <textEffects>Kurain Channeling Technique</textEffects>.
</line><line>Iris:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That night... ...someone <textEffects>channeled</textEffects> Dahlia's spirit. And you knew about it! And that's the secret you've been trying to hide from me!
</line><line>Iris:
... Aaaaaah!

...I have asked her everything I can in my capacity as a prosecutor. This incident... Everything related to it goes back to the history of the Fey clan.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's what it looks like. Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me.
</line><line>Iris:
What is it...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with <textEffects>a certain college student</textEffects> in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...?
</line><line>Iris:
... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... ...I see. Thank you for your help.
</line><line>Iris:
You're welcome...
</line><line>von Karma:
Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate!
</line><line>Iris:
Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you. <textEffects>(I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant <span style="color:#E16935">secret</textEffects> left to unlock... Pearls's <textEffects>Psyche-Lock</textEffects>...)</span>

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>February 9

<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Look at that! They really did make a fire, right in front of the shack...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
Oh! Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Butz:
Hah! You're too late, Nick! If you came here for one of our potatoes, we've already polished them all off!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I think I've pretty much got all the evidence I need. Now I just need to find out what Pearls is hiding.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
You went here, didn't you Pearls?
</line><line>Pearl:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like she's still not going to open up to me.)</textEffects> This is where you went because you were <textEffects>so worried</textEffects>, right? Then the next question is, "Who or what were you so worried about?" Now, I'm going to take a guess, and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong, OK?
</line><line>Pearl:
Y-You mean you know!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If I'm right, will you tell me the whole truth?
</line><line>Pearl:
... O-OK...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>You went to this place for one very simple reason, and that is this:</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It's obvious what you were so worried about, Pearls. It was <textEffects>Maya</textEffects>, wasn't it?
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You knew the training Maya was undertaking was dangerous. After all, it was the Special Course.
</line><line>Pearl:
...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
I signed up for your "Special Course"!
</line><line>Bikini:
Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Sister Bikini scared you with what she said, didn't she? And because it was you who introduced Hazakura Temple to Maya in the first place... ...you felt responsible, didn't you?
</line><line>Pearl:
... Thinking about what could happen to Mystic Maya made me more and more worried... I couldn't sit still at all. That's why I decided to go and find out how she was doing at the Inner Temple.
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
Then we're clear now that you went to the Inner Temple that night, Pearls. What's not clear is what happened after that...
</line><line>Pearl:
Unngh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
About what time was it when you headed over to the Inner Temple?
</line><line>Pearl:
Um... It was probably around 9:30 when I left the Main Hall. I heard the real training was supposed to start at 10. I wanted to get there before it started. But there was so much snow, so I didn't get there until after 10 o'clock.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Until after 10? How did you know what time it was?
</line><line>Pearl:
Because I heard the bell ringing for lights out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She heard the <span style="color:#E16935">lights out bell</textEffects>...?)</span> The Hazakura Temple bell's pretty small though, isn't it? You must have really good hearing.
</line><line>Pearl:
I... I was really trying to pick up the sound of that bell, that's all. I didn't want to miss it. That would be terrible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She was trying to hear the bell...?)</textEffects> Tell me, Pearls... Why were you so worried about hearing that bell?
</line><line>Pearl:
Huh!? Oh! I...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I think I know why. The reason you were so worried about that bell was because of this:</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
You were given some <textEffects>instructions</textEffects> to follow for that night, weren't you?
</line><line>Pearl:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I presume you recognize these pieces of paper?
</line><line>Pearl:
Aaaaah! Wh-Where did you...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>In the incinerator</textEffects> at the Inner Temple. Pearls... You were following the instructions in this letter that night, weren't you? That's why you couldn't afford to miss the sound of the <textEffects>lights out bell</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pearl:
I... I'm speechless, Mr. Nick! You're amazing!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
These instructions that were found in the incinerator... I believe they were written for you, Pearls.
</line><line>Pearl:
For me!? I... No...
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see, a large portion has been burnt... But the last section is still fairly legible. "As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must <textEffects>channel her spirit</textEffects>."
</line><line>Pearl:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who was it, Pearls? Whose spirit were you supposed to be <textEffects>channeling</textEffects>?
</line><line>Pearl:
Nngh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Taking into account the author of the <span style="color:#E16935">note</textEffects>, and their <textEffects>purpose</textEffects> for writing it... ...<textEffects>whose spirit</textEffects> would Pearls have been <textEffects>trying to channel</textEffects>? Don't over-think it, Phoenix! It's pretty obvious who Pearls was supposed to channel...)</span> <textEffects>The person you were trying to channel that night, Pearls, was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it? That was the name that was in the letter.
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's just as I suspected... It wasn't Iris who Sister Bikini met at the Inner Temple that night... It was <span style="color:#E16935">Dahlia Hawthorne</textEffects>!)</span> Do you know anything about her, Pearls? Do you know what kind of a woman <textEffects>Dahlia Hawthorne</textEffects> was?
</line><line>Pearl:
Umm... no. I've never heard of anyone by that name before reading those instructions...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I thought so. Pearls doesn't have a clue. She doesn't know that Dahlia is her <span style="color:#E16935">sister</textEffects>...)</span> About the instructions in the letter I found, Pearls... Who wrote them?
</line><line>Pearl:
Umm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whoever it was asked you to channel the spirit of someone you'd never heard of... You must have quite a lot of respect for them.
</line><line>Pearl:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
After all, you followed their instructions without question. So here's my next question. <textEffects>Who wrote this set of instructions for you to follow...?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Pearls... I have to wonder about something... You didn't have any idea what these instructions meant, did you?
</line><line>Pearl:
...*ba-dump*
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you followed them to the letter regardless. Why? Because it was your own mother who asked you. That's why.
</line><line>Pearl:
H-How did you...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I figured it out. The person who wrote you this letter was your own mother, Morgan Fey!
</line><line>Pearl:
Uh... Waaaaaaaah!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>
Phoenix:
Alright, Pearls! It's time you started telling me the truth.
</line><line>Pearl:
M-M-Mr. N-Nick... I-I-I...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why's she holding back from me? I don't like this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Pearl:
D-D-Don't underestimate m-me, j-just because I'm a ch-child!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Pearl:
If you're trying to say I followed these instructions... I'd l-like to see some proof!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Because... I... I d-don't think y-y-you have a-a-any!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nnnnnngh... <textEffects>(She'd say anything rather than admit to carrying out those instructions... I guess I'll have to produce some more evidence, then. One more thing should do it.)</textEffects> ...Alright, Pearls. We both know someone carried out these instructions on the night of the murder. But you're right. There's no evidence that proves it was you.
</line><line>Pearl:
I-I-I knew it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
However... I do know that whoever did it was a <textEffects>child</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pearl:
Huh? H-How do you know that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It couldn't have been an adult... No adult would've made a simple mistake like that.
</line><line>Pearl:
A... <textEffects>simple mistake</textEffects>? What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure you thought you were carefully following the instructions you'd been given. <textEffects>But you misunderstood some of the words, and this is the evidence that proves it!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It was you who splattered gravy on this hanging scroll, wasn't it?
</line><line>Pearl:
Ah! Wh-What!? Wh-Why would I d-do something like...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you remember what was written in that letter? "Gravely roast the Master in the fires of Hades and bring our vengeance to fruition." But you didn't know how to read the words "<textEffects>gravely</textEffects>" and "<textEffects>roast</textEffects>" among others, right?
</line><line>Pearl:
H-How do you know that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember the conversation you had with Ms. Deauxnim on the night of the murder...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Elise:
Perhaps we can read some books together.
</line><line>Pearl:
R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.
</line><line>Elise:
Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?
</line><line>Pearl:
Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?
</line><line>Elise:
It says, "gravely"... That's kind of a tough word.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read "<textEffects>gravely</textEffects>" and "<textEffects>roast</textEffects>". But what she didn't teach you... ...is <textEffects>what they meant</textEffects>!
</line><line>Pearl:
"Gravely" sounded like "gravy" to me, and the only "roast" I could think of was the food...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's why you did it... That's why you covered the picture of the <textEffects>Master</textEffects> in <textEffects>gravy</textEffects> from that night's pot <textEffects>roast</textEffects>.
</line><line>Pearl:
... To be honest... I did think it was a bit strange. I guess I really did get the wrong idea...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just a tiny bit.
</line><line>Pearl:
I... I really am useless! I didn't even manage to burn the letter properly as my mother had asked of me... Such a simple thing... And I couldn't even do it right...

G-Godot!

</line><line>Godot:
...But it's all a waste of time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-Why do you say that?
</line><line>Godot:
Because Maya Fey isn't coming back.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? You don't know what you're talking about! How can you say something like that?
</line><line>Godot:
It was your job to protect her, Trite. Just like it was your job to protect Mia Fey... Two sisters, caught up in the worst circumstances.

I... I realize that, but...
</line><line>Godot:
And you were the only one who was by their sides. You were the only one who could have saved them.

But I didn't know anything about what was going on!

Ha...! What did I just say, Trite? Being oblivious is a heinous crime in itself.

Tomorrow... We'll settle everything in court tomorrow. ...Once and for all.
