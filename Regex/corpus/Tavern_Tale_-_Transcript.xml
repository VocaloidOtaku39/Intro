<i>Tavern</i>
</line><line>Barnham:
One puzzle means...one more step on the path to puzzle <textEffects>mastery</textEffects>...
</line><line>Rouge:
Well, I hope you have some comfy shoes ready...because at this rate, you're gonna be walking that path <textEffects>forever</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmph...the fiercer the adversary, the better, I assure you. That is why... no matter how foolishly difficult this infernal "<textEffects>More Chalices!</textEffects>" may be, it WILL be solved by the hand of Barnham!
</line><line>Rouge:
You sure about that? It looks to me like the hand of Barnham could use a hand of its own right about now, Zacky-boy!
</line><line>Barnham:
Tell me, Rouge, how many chalices have I <textEffects>broken</textEffects> since starting this puzzle three nights ago?
</line><line>Rouge:
Heh. Let's just say, if you take any longer... I'll be having to serve my customers juice out of their own hats.
</line><line>Barnham:
...Well, I should make my way back. It seems the storm outside has subsided.
</line><line>Rouge:
............ A stormy night like this...really brings back memories, doesn't it, Zack? Like the time you first set foot into this very tavern... It was a dark and stormy night just like this one.
</line><line>Barnham:
...... Indeed, it was.
</line><line>Rouge:
Heh. I remember you walked through that door soggier than a rat in a river...
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center">...Open the door! Hurry!Hold your horses, I'm coming... Tavern's closed, you know. You're lucky I'm even opening the door in this storm. You...aren't you...Zacharias Barnham?Please, I require your aid for just a moment.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
Well, well...what aid could THE captain of the knights need from a lowly tavern owner like me? If you think for a second I'm going to sell out whatever bandit you're after, then you've got another thing coming.
</line><line>Barnham:
Please...they are after us. I ask for but a moment's shelter.
</line><line>Rouge:
"<textEffects>After you</textEffects>"...?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Surely you have heard word of the recent <textEffects>witch sighting</textEffects> at the farm on the outskirts of town, have you not?
</line><line>Rouge:
Who hasn't? Word is that witch did quite a number on the farm's chickens and crops. I heard you guys tried to put up a fence to keep 'em out. A lot of good that did, huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
There were no traces of footprints at the scene. 'Twas surely a witch's handiwork.
</line><line>Rouge:
So? Shouldn't you be out there hunting down this supposed witch?
</line><line>Barnham:
That is correct... And so, tonight I finally managed to capture the <textEffects>culprit</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rouge:
You caught the culprit...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes. This fiend right here...
</line><line>Grrrr... Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
</line><line>Barnham:
I give you...our "<textEffects>witch</textEffects>"... The beast cannot be more than a year old.
</line><line>Rouge:
My, my...he's certainly the tiniest "criminal" I've ever seen.
</line><line>Barnham:
Quite. Every day, this beast has been getting itself into trouble. Honestly... No one would've ever suspected this pup could be the one behind those missing chickens.
</line><line>Rouge:
...By the way, I've gotta ask: what's up with that <textEffects>helmet</textEffects>?
</line><line>Barnham:
...I put it on him a short while ago. 'Tis a toy helmet I just happened to have lying around.
</line><line>Rouge:
Let me see if I'm barking up the right tree... This little guy here would hide in the bushes and attack any passing dogs or kids?
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed.
</line><line>Rouge:
...Okay, but there were a LOT of chickens and crops that went missing from that farm. Why on earth would this little guy go and take so many? If he was planning on eating them, you'd think one chicken would be more than enough for 'im.
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes... The beast is still a mere whelp. Every battle is, for him, a terrifying battle of <textEffects>life or death</textEffects>. Until now, the source of the disappearing chickens was a mystery. However, tonight our little friend here made a grave <textEffects>error</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rouge:
What kind of error?
</line><line>Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">There was a group of townspeople patrolling the <textEffects>crime scene</textEffects> during the storm tonight. They were under the assumption that the culprit was a witch. Something tells me the pup's little trick didn't go as planned. Yet...he went through with his <textEffects>trick</textEffects> and ended up biting off more than he could chew...so to speak. The townspeople were hungry for a culprit to capture and chased after the mutt. He was thus forced to escape into the forest. He managed to lose them in the forest. ...With the exception of one.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
And let me guess...that "<textEffects>one</textEffects>" was one Zacharias Barnham, right?
</line><line>Barnham:
He truly put forth a valiant effort... Quite clever for the beast that he is.
</line><line>Rouge:
The little guy must have been scared stiff, what with all that armour clattering around after him.
</line><line>...Woof! Woof!
</line><line>Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">I chased him through the forest, before finally... he grew tired and stopped to rest in a clearing deep within the forest. ...'Twas the beast's <textEffects>home</textEffects>.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">So you ended up smack dab in the middle of "<textEffects>enemy territory</textEffects>". Sounds like an impasse if I ever saw one. So, what then? The <textEffects>chase</textEffects> was over. Why didn't you just hand the pup over to the townsfolk?</captions>
<line>
Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">............ That was not an option.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">And why's that?</captions>
<line>
Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">It was because...of what I saw there deep within the recesses of that forest.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...?</captions>
<line>
Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">I saw...the chickens the beast had taken. His <textEffects>prey</textEffects> was left in a large pile. And yet...there was no hint that he had actually eaten any of them.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
Wh-what do you mean?
</line><line>Barnham:
Curled up among this mountain of chickens, lay a much larger dog... It was readily apparent that the beast was already dead.
</line><line>Rouge:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
This little one here nestled itself against the larger beast, yet there was no response. I could but gaze upon this whelp in silent admiration for his efforts...
</line><line>Grrrrrrr...
</line><line>Barnham:
I distinctly remember the larger one's appearance... It had a scar above its left eye, a tail that looked as if it were singed by the Legendary Fire itself, and black and white coloured fur.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">............ I...knew that beast.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">You did...?</captions>
<line>
Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">We had met once before...in town, not a few days prior. ...I was at the head of the Storyteller's <textEffects>parade</textEffects>. That's when... suddenly a large dog jumped in front of me. It had been chasing the chickens at the farm nearby when it shot forth from the alley. ...I was caught completely off guard. My horse instantly reeled back in panic, but sadly I was unable to calm it... I failed to keep hold of the reins... There was naught I could do and so I was thrust from my horse.</captions>
<line>
Rouge:
...Oh, I get it now. That must've been the famous <textEffects>Barnham's Wild Ride</textEffects> incident everyone loves talking about. Heard you were dragged all over town. Don't seem any worse for wear, though. You're definitely now the stuff of <textEffects>legends</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Unfortunately, the dog that ran into the parade was much more "<textEffects>worse for wear</textEffects>".
</line><line>Rouge:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
In the chaos that followed, the beast was caught under my horse, trampled and kicked aside. Somehow it managed to drag itself upright... It then limped its way back to the alley and disappeared.
</line><line>Rouge:
...Unbelievable. So you mean...
</line><line>Barnham:
...Indeed. The dead dog in the forest was the very same dog from the parade. There is no mistake... The beast was <textEffects>mortally wounded</textEffects> at that parade.
</line><line>Rouge:
A-all right, so... What about the pup?
</line><line>Barnham:
'Tis only an assumption, but... perhaps this little one is the beast's offspring.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...Since that day. This little one, despite his small stature and fear, would face prey much bigger than himself. When his strength failed him and he could no longer move, he would escape into the forest. All this for the sake of his mother. Day after day...never once realising that his mother had long since uttered her last breath...</captions>
<line>
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Grrrrrrr...</captions>
<line>
Barnham:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...If only I had not fallen from my horse. ...If only I had been able to take control...</captions>
<line>How can I call myself <textEffects>captain of the knights</textEffects>, when I was the one who robbed this little one of his mother?
</line><line>Rouge:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
I think...this little one was there to witness what I did to his mother. He must be quite aware of my <textEffects>actions</textEffects> that day.
</line><line>Rouge:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Grrrrrr...
</line><line>Barnham:
While he may still be young, and his stature small...this dog is a true <textEffects>knight</textEffects> of the highest calibre. He protects that which needs protecting. And...will ready his fangs at but a moment's notice for many a just cause. ...That is why I could not simply hand this most valiant <textEffects>knight</textEffects> over to the townsfolk.
</line><line>Rouge:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
As we speak, they are braving the storm in search of him. However, they will likely give up before too long. I ask you, please keep this little one safe here... I beg of you.
</line><line>Rouge:
............ What exactly do you plan on doing with the pup?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ This brave little knight stood valiantly in the face of insurmountable odds, all for the sake of protecting one close to him. As such, I will first assign him a most noble <textEffects>name</textEffects> befitting one of such valour. Then...I will personally see to it that he is welcomed into the Knights of the Inquisition.
</line><line>Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
</line><line>Rouge:
...Hmph. From where I'm standing, it really doesn't look like this little guy is all too thrilled with you and your plans.
</line><line>Barnham:
I-it would appear so, but...
</line><line>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr... Woooooof! Woooooof!
</line><line>Barnham:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
</line><line>Rouge:
No doubt about it... He doesn't like you one bit. ...That's what <textEffects>little guys</textEffects> like this do. They bite.
</line><line>Barnham:
U-urgh... 'Twas my error!
</line><line>Rouge:
Oh, c'mon now. You're not even bleeding, you big baby. The big bad knight captain...bitten by a cute little pup, like some kind of chew toy. Not the most "manly" of stories.
</line><line>Barnham:
...Nonsense! It was an honour to be chewed on by such an admirable creature.
</line><line>Rouge:
Heh. Ever the fast-talker, eh, Mr Knight Captain? Look, gimme a minute and I'll get you patched up in no time. Until then... how about you keep yourself entertained with this little puzzle I came up with... <textEffects>Mouse Mayhem 2</textEffects> should be child's play for a knight like you, Mr Knight Captain!
</line>

<hr />
<line>Layton:
I see. My, how fascinating... No doubt this puzzle was originally created quite a while ago, is that correct?
</line><line>Barnham:
S-Sir Top Hat?!
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. And a good evening to you,  Mr Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
W-were you here this whole time...?!
</line><line>Layton:
Not at all. I just arrived right now to get a cup of water. ...Hmm, but it does seem I've managed to arrive just in time to hear an <textEffects>old story</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rouge:
Heh... Anyway, where's the rest of your motley crew gone?
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, yes. Mr Wright and the others appear to be sound asleep upstairs. They were all enjoying being together again after so long, they must have tired themselves out quite a bit.
</line><line>Rouge:
Ah, all right. Well, glad to hear they're doin' fine.
</line><line>Layton:
...By the way, Mr Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what is it?
</line><line>Layton:
Perhaps you could tell me how you obtained that <textEffects>scar</textEffects> I see above your left eyebrow...
</line><line>Barnham:
...... I received this quite some time ago. A most formidable <textEffects>knight</textEffects> gave me this old wound. 'Twas not by his sword, but rather his small <textEffects>fangs</textEffects> that he gave me this injury.
</line><line>Rouge:
...Say, Mr Fancy Hat.
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, Miss Rouge?
</line><line>Rouge:
That little...story you just heard. Do me a favour and keep it under that hat of yours, okay?
</line><line>Layton:
Why, of course, Miss Rouge. However...there is but one <textEffects>condition</textEffects>.
</line><line>Rouge:
...And that is?
</line><line>Layton:
If you would do me the honour... of allowing me to take on the puzzle that left Mr Barnham stumped for three days... I speak of <textEffects>More Chalices</textEffects>!
</line><line>Rouge:
............ Well, well, well...looks like we've got ourselves another challenger.
