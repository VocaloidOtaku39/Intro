So! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's "Wright" with a "W"! Uh, but not "write", right?
</line><line>Vera:
......
</line><line>Trucy:
Um! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...Good morning...
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(She... She speaks!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Hmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know?
</line><line>Apollo:
Trucy! Let's... take it easy for starters.
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...Thank you for taking my case...
</line><line>Trucy:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Vera:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(There she goes with the nail polish again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
That's great, really! It's so cultured!
</line><line>Vera:
............ ...Want to try...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oooooh! Really!?
</line><line>Apollo:
*sigh* Girls... <textEffects>(The victim, Drew Misham, was a <span style="color:#E16935">forger</textEffects>. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.)</span>

District CourtCourtroom No. 3</textEffects></center>
<line>
Judge:
Well, we will now... er... *cough* Begin the, er, trial of... Vuh... Vuh... Vuh... Vera Misham!
</line><line>Trucy:
...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like.
</line><line>Judge:
Erm... ahem. The repercussions of today's trial will, most likely, be felt for a long time. ...And may, indeed, alter our legal system forever.
</line><line>Klavier:
Today is a test of the <textEffects>Jurist System</textEffects>... ...and the first step toward a new order in our courts.
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy's <textEffects>secret mission</textEffects>!
</line><line>Klavier:
The jurists will function like a <textEffects>jury</textEffects>. It is hoped their inclusion will help the courts to better reflect the people's will.
</line><line>Apollo:
Why... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom?
</line><line>Klavier:
Three closed-circuit cameras watch this courtroom at all times. The jurists have access to everything that transpires. Jurists! Judge well, and judge cool.
</line><line>Judge:
N-Now see here, Prosecutor Gavin! I-I was going to say that!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, my apologies, Herr Judge.
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. Jurists! Today, er... Judge today's trial "coolly", if you would be so kind!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their "feelings". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. The details of the case, if you would.
</line><line>Klavier:
The victim is the painter <textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects>. He was killed in his own studio. His coffee... was poisoned. By whom, you ask? By none other than the defendant, Vera Misham.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
There wasn't any poison in the coffee!
</line><line>Klavier:
Achtung... Someone has been doing their homework! Indeed. Poison was not present in the coffee... but on the mug itself.
</line><line>Judge:
The mug...? Ah, residue was found on the rim, I see.
</line><line>Klavier:
The autopsy report describes the manner of our victim's death.
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts this as evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Misham's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
According to this report... ...the victim's death was caused by "<textEffects>atroquinine</textEffects>" poisoning.
</line><line>Klavier:
A chemical compound that does not occur naturally. Lethal dosage is a mere 0.002mg. A touch of atroquinine in the body... ...is the touch of the Reaper's scythe.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. You may present your witness.
</line><line>Klavier:
I have for you today a simple man, for a simple case. ...A man who witnessed the murder in its entirety.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That journalist, no doubt...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Klavier:
The witness will state his name and occupation.
</line><line>Brushel:
Ah! Right! Well, for starters, my name's Spark Brushel! My job is... a lone observer of the world!
</line><line>Apollo:
In other words, a freelance journalist, right?
</line><line>Brushel:
Ahem! If you don't mind, I'd like to state something here for the record.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Mr. Brushel?
</line><line>Brushel:
I dislike conclusions, specifically, the jumping to aspect of conclusions. "Preconceptions Make Park Sandbox of Endless Desert Waste..." end quote.
</line><line>Apollo:
But, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday.
</line><line>Brushel:
...Well, that's true, yes. But you must understand, I stand before you today a man with a dream! I'm offering you my testimony in exchange for exclusive rights to the story! "Scoop Turns Mr. Brushel Into THAT Mr. Brushel!" end quote.
</line><line>Judge:
...Let's hear your testimony then, shall we?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(A "<span style="color:#E16935">simple case</textEffects>", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.)</span>

Hmm... That does sound like a simple case. Unless... you were the one who poisoned him!

Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatareyousaying!? Judge!
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. Need I remind you, the cameras are rolling today. I felt the need to be a bit dramatic.

You didn't do it, did you?

</line><line>Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun.

I'm so happy for him.

</line>

<line>Trucy:
He sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job.
</line><line>Apollo:
There's only one moment we need to focus on, really.
</line><line>Trucy:
...The moment when Drew Misham died?
</line><line>Apollo:
Exactly. There has to be something there!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
You know what I have a problem with? A particular <textEffects>property</textEffects> of the poison used, <textEffects>atroquinine</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh? Prosecutor Gavin was quite clear about the poison. A lethal dosage of 0.002mg paralyzes the central nervous system. If you drank that, even you, Mr. Justice, would be reduced to a quivering pile...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Why are you using me as an example!?)</textEffects> Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information!
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Judge:
An omission?
</line><line>Apollo:
Atroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is <textEffects>slow-acting</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Slow-acting!
</line><line>Brushel:
Whatwhatwhatwhat!?
</line><line>Apollo:
According to one forensic scientist...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
It's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
If we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!!! What's the meaning of this!? If what the defense says is correct... ...why, that contradicts the entire testimony we've just heard!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!?
</line><line>Brushel:
Slow-acting. S-L-O-W A-C-T... It was virulent, alright. Even then, it had already begun digging its claws into the journalist.
</line><line>Trucy:
...He's working on his scoop.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(*sigh*)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Klavier:
...It's "Brushel", ja? Herr Brushel... let's take a trip back down memory lane.
</line><line>Brushel:
Huh?
</line><line>Klavier:
Did the victim really die <textEffects>the instant he took a sip</textEffects>? Think it over. This is vital.
</line><line>Brushel:
You know what I think? I think that was... "A Not-So-Subliminal Suggestion"... end quote.
</line><line>Klavier:
I admit, it does cause a problem if he died when you say he died. ...I would be forced to say auf Wiedersehen to my simple case. And you would be forced to say farewell to your article.
</line><line>Brushel:
Come again?
</line><line>Klavier:
You can't write a story based on conjecture, can you? And as the case drags on, other reporters will pick up the scent. ...And you'll be forced to kiss your exclusive scoop goodbye.
</line><line>Brushel:
Scoop... Scoop... .....................! Look, wait. Just wait a second. Just one second.
</line><line>Judge:
We're waiting, we're waiting! Out with it!
</line><line>Brushel:
I think I just recalled a so-called "important detail"! "A Revival of Recollection", end quote! "A Story's Survival", end quote!
</line><line>Apollo:
"Attorney Utterly Confused", end quote.
</line><line>Brushel:
Actually, I did notice something when I visited the studio. I'd heard of poison that "<textEffects>takes its sweet time</textEffects>", see!
</line><line>Klavier:
...But not what I've been saying for the last few minutes, apparently.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Brushel! Are you saying you noticed something that explains what happened!?
</line><line>Brushel:
You bet I am! The "Antidote For A Poisonous Contradiction", end quote, you might say!
</line><line>Apollo:
Or "I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About", end quote, I might say.
</line><line>Brushel:
I figured it out, but only after an in-depth interview! See, thanks to my journalism skills, I know who poisoned that coffee!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Klavier:
As far as I can tell, the witness is standing by his testimony. ...That Mr. Misham died the instant after he drank.
</line><line>Brushel:
Of course I'm standing by my testimony! ...And my dream of exclusive rights to this story!
</line><line>Klavier:
...Ach. I suppose it was too much to hope for.
</line><line>Apollo:
What was?
</line><line>Klavier:
Of course he wouldn't choose a simple case, not him.
</line><line>Judge:
"Him"...?
</line><line>Klavier:
Phoenix Wright, who else?
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Achtung, Herr Brushel! Report for us, if you would. What is it that you noticed?
</line><line>Brushel:
......
</line><line>Judge:
This court is a critical trial of the Jurist System. I'm afraid no room for doubt is permissible. You will testify to the court about <textEffects>what you noticed</textEffects>!

When I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.He seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope.I thought nothing of it at the time, of course.Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... A suicide note?
</line><line>Brushel:
Yes... he had this look on his face. "Man's Face Inscrutable As A Quadratic Equation", end quote.
</line><line>Trucy:
Suicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent!
</line><line>Apollo:
Would someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh.

Very well, you may begin your cross-examination.

<line>Brushel:
<textEffects>I thought nothing of it at the time, of course.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Brushel:
<textEffects>Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Brushel:
<textEffects>It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Trucy:
Do you think Mr. Misham was writing a suicide note?
</line><line>Apollo:
If he was, that would solve the case in a jiffy.
</line><line>Trucy:
It kind of makes me wonder about that letter...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene. In a red envelope!
</line><line>Brushel:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin!
</line><line>Klavier:
...Yes?
</line><line>Apollo:
Was a <textEffects>yellow</textEffects> envelope found at the scene of the crime?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Unfortunately no. But, Herr Forehead... ...it's easy to mistake the color of an envelope.
</line><line>Apollo:
I guess. But not this envelope. You see, it was postmarked already. Seven years ago.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Brushel?
</line><line>Brushel:
...I can explain that. Drew, right, he wanted to get that letter in an envelope, pronto! Get it out of sight of my beady eyes, right? So he grabbed the nearest envelope and crammed away!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(And what about the whole <span style="color:#E16935">red</textEffects> and <textEffects>yellow</textEffects> envelope contradiction, chump!?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Have you anything to say to the witness's claim?
</line><line>Apollo:
"That night, the victim put a letter he had been writing in a red envelope"...
</line>


<line>Apollo:
...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope! With, erm, the assistance of a forensic scientist.
</line><line>Klavier:
What...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Note that this letter is addressed to "<textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects>".
</line><line>Brushel:
Oh?
</line><line>Apollo:
Why would he address a letter to himself? Let alone send a suicide note to himself!
</line><line>Brushel:
...... I... I've been scooped!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Brushel! Can you explain this to the court?
</line><line>Brushel:
Oh, my, my, my. How could I have forgotten? I suppose this happens to the best of us! "Reporter Gets Old, Forgets Lots", end quote.
</line><line>Judge:
I'm still waiting for an explanation, Mr. Brushel!
</line><line>Brushel:
Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something!
</line><line>Apollo:
His desk drawer...?
</line><line>Brushel:
Yes! A stamp! A so-called "Postage Stamp", end quote!
</line><line>Judge:
A stamp? Whatever for?
</line><line>Brushel:
Well, to mail his letter, what else? And then, why yes, I think I saw him put it in his letter box. Yes, it was a yellow envelope, and he put it in that box!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, apparently, this yellow letter has nothing to do with this case.
</line><line>Brushel:
Oh, how I wish it did! Just think if that were a suicide note... What a story! "Star Writes Suicide Note In Front Of Reporter, Falls", end quote.
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. As I was saying, that has nothing to do with this case! That said.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
It makes me wonder about the contents of that red envelope. $100,000 is quite a good deal of money!
</line><line>Klavier:
So this was from seven years ago, ja...?
</line><line>Brushel:
...! So, am I finished? Here, I mean. Am I finished here? I was thinking of, you know, going home, to start writing...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Um, I hate to state what should be pretty obvious to anyone... ...but when you catch the scent of a story... ...you make that... er, rather unique face.
</line><line>Brushel:
Ack! C-C'mon! "Attorney Has Active Imagination, Little Else", end quote.
</line><line>Judge:
Even I noticed something, and my eyes aren't what they used to be. You know, I'm starting to understand what all this "perceiving" stuff is about!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>("Judge Has Active Imagination"... end quote.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Please, continue with your testimony. Tell us about <textEffects>the scent of a story</textEffects>!

<hr />
<line>Judge:
So you threatened to go to press with this "story"? That's how you got your interview? Blackmail?
</line><line>Brushel:
Well, yes. ... I mean no! No, no, no, no! It wasn't exactly black... I mean, I'm not... urk!
</line><line>Judge:
...Something wrong, Mr. Brushel?
</line><line>Brushel:

While you have me chatting away in here, what's going on out there? What if some Wally Wordsworth or Sally Scooper gets wind of my story? They could be going to press while I'm going to waste!

</line><line>Apollo:
It all makes sense. Nothing jumps out as ridiculous.
</line><line>Trucy:
I wonder what this "story" he's talking about is? It must have been good, to get an interview with a famous recluse like that.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Something powerful enough to drag Drew Misham out of hiding. I wonder... Maybe it had something to do with Mr. Misham's art?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Sweat much, Mr. Brushel?
</line><line>Brushel:
Urk! Eh, yeah, well... ...a man can't help his glands, you know!
</line><line>Apollo:
It's more than that. When "<textEffects>Mr. Misham's talent</textEffects>" was mentioned... ...you suddenly <textEffects>began to sweat buckets</textEffects>.
</line><line>Brushel:
...Ack!
</line><line>Apollo:
You're hiding something... about his talent!
</line><line>Brushel:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-That's r-r-r-ridiculous!

</line>


<line>Apollo:
This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio.
</line><line>Brushel:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
There are two problems with this painting. The first is it wasn't painted by Mr. Misham. The second is that there was another painting in the studio... ...which looked exactly like this one. Except it was only half done!
</line><line>Brushel:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
Then we have a letter discussing a payment of $100,000. Which suggests a certain <textEffects>business</textEffects> operation. The business of making <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>!
</line><line>Brushel:
Aoooooooooooooogg!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
...That is all, Your Honor.
</line><line>Brushel:
Everyone! Please, everyone! Can we keep this private? Please!? This is my story! My scoop!
</line><line>Judge:
Forgery... that's a serious crime!
</line><line>Brushel:
Drew Misham is known as an artist these days. But there were rumors he dabbled in another kind of art until a few years back.
</line><line>Judge:
"Another art" meaning... forgery?
</line><line>Brushel:
Drew Misham was talented, alright. Talented at making precise, detailed fakes. A fact that certain criminal elements were quick to discover.
</line><line>Apollo:
Criminal elements...? What...!? You can't seriously be talking about...
</line><line>Brushel:
...Exactly. I'm talking about <textEffects>forging evidence</textEffects>! The rumors started circulating seven years ago.
</line><line>Judge:
S-Seven years ago...? So, are we to understand that this letter... ...this payment of <textEffects>$100,000</textEffects> was for...?
</line><line>Brushel:
...Exactly. "<textEffects>Forged Evidence</textEffects> Nets Tidy Profit", end quote.
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Why, it's like our victim was living a double life!
</line><line>Apollo:

Hey, hey, hey, the only thing I poison is my pen... when I'm writing reviews!

Mr. Brushel, your testimony to this point has been quite unreliable. ...It doesn't speak well of your reporting acumen.

In any case... Let's hear a summarized recap of your testimony. If we can ascertain the situation in that studio from the recap, the trial is over.
</line><line>Trucy:
Apollo! What's he talking about?
</line><line>Apollo:
The cross-examination showed Mr. Brushel didn't have reason or means to poison him. As long as there're no other suspects... ...then the killer had to be Vera. That's what. ...This next testimony is our last chance!

Mr. Brushel, your testimony please!

<line>Apollo:
This is the only link between that studio and the outside world.
</line><line>Judge:
A letter box?
</line><line>Apollo:
What did Mr. Brushel just tell us? When he entered the studio on the night of the murder... ...the victim had <textEffects>just finished writing a letter</textEffects>!
</line><line>Brushel:
Yeah, I said that. And yeah, it was true.
</line><line>Apollo:
Furthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box.

Ah...!

But that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the "yellow envelope" disappeared!

...Ah, yes, intriguing. So an envelope has disappeared from the scene of the crime. Of course... this changes nothing.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh...?
</line><line>Judge:
He has a point, Mr. Justice. What we're trying to figure out here is how the poison got into Mr. Misham. Is it really important that this envelope the witness says he saw disappeared?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me!
</line><line>Judge:
Very well then. The witness will add this to his testimony.

You got it.

</line><line>Apollo:
If he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his <textEffects>tongue</textEffects>, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm?
</line><line>Klavier:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Those traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the <textEffects>other way around</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What!?
</line><line>Apollo:
The <textEffects>coffee mug didn't poison</textEffects> Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham <textEffects>poisoned the coffee mug himself</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! B-But that doesn't... Does it?
</line><line>Apollo:
Recall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a <textEffects>slow-acting</textEffects> poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe.
</line><line>Judge:
You have something to add, Mr. Brushel?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Brushel:
As I believe I mentioned earlier.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Brushel:
Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Yes! A stamp! A so-called "Postage Stamp", end quote!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Brushel:
But you know, I don't seem to remember him <textEffects>ever finding one</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Maybe he'd just run out?
</line><line>Klavier:
Incidentally, we searched the desk drawer at the scene of the crime. There were no stamps. Not a single one.
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm, that does pose a problem. How will you prove that the stamp was coated with poison?
</line><line>Apollo:
Actually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha. ...Good show, good show. You can't even prove there was a stamp at the scene in the first place!
</line><line>Judge:
...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway. Where's your evidence that proves the existence of this <textEffects>poisoned stamp</textEffects>?
</line>


<line>Judge:
Well, that certainly is a cute little <textEffects>frame</textEffects>. And by little, I mean really little.
</line><line>Apollo:
It was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself.
</line><line>Klavier:
I noticed that too during my inspection. So what?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important.
</line><line>Judge:
"Missing" something...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... <textEffects>Atroquinine residue</textEffects>!
</line><line>Klavier:
What!? Why wasn't I told about this!?
</line><line>Apollo:
The frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most.
</line><line>Klavier:
You aren't saying...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! The poisoned stamp was in this frame...!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Impossible!
</line><line>Judge:
P-Prosecutor Gavin...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Why would he put something like that on his desk? Don't tell me he had it there so he could commit suicide if the mood struck!
</line><line>Brushel:
You know, can I say something? I had a thought, see!
</line><line>Judge:
What, Mr. Brushel, and please stop jittering around like that!
</line><line>Brushel:
The victim was a <textEffects>forger</textEffects>, right? There's a lot of money in that line of work. "Forger Forges Friends, Makes Enemies, Too", end quote.
</line><line>Apollo:
So the poisoned stamp might have been a <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects>, aimed at him!
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
...Oh, rich. That's rich. Leave the ridiculous flights of fancy to the Gavinners's song lyrics, please.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Finally, something we agree on.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
The stamp was a "murder weapon"? Nonsense! Murder is a simple business. Who would go to such lengths? No one.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, I disagree.
</line><line>Klavier:
C-Come again...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Recall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the <textEffects>mail</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
The... mail!
</line><line>Apollo:
Now, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a <textEffects>stamp</textEffects> would be the perfect weapon!
</line><line>Klavier:
Ridiculous! Where's your proof? I want proof! Show us evidence that this poisoned stamp was sent to him... as a murder weapon!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I might not have "<span style="color:#E16935">evidence</textEffects>" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!)</span>
</line><line>Trucy:
Wh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling!
</line><line>Apollo:
I think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, fill us in, Mr. Justice!
</line><line>Apollo:
...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the <textEffects>intent to kill</textEffects> sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death!
</line>


<line>Judge:
Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?
</line><line>Apollo:
Think about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. "...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days." The enclosed <textEffects>stamp</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Brushel:
In other words, if I have this straight... "The Stamp! Poison! On The Stamp! Lick, Lick, Gasp..." end quote!
</line><line>Apollo:
Now, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked?
</line><line>Trucy:
He would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Fifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects> would be taken away from the scene.
</line><line>Judge:
...Quite conveniently, thanks to the postal system!
</line><line>Klavier:
...Such a splendid imagination you have, Herr Forehead!
</line><line>Apollo:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Let me confirm one thing with you, if I might. So, this "poisoned stamp" was inside this envelope from seven years ago... ja? Is that what you'd have us believe? Really?
</line><line>Apollo:
...W-Well...
</line><line>Trucy:
It is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility.
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes. A very small possibility. How small, I wonder?
</line><line>Trucy:
Um...
</line><line>Klavier:
A poisoned stamp in this envelope? A stamp that then became the murder weapon? How do you intend to prove this seeming coincidence?
</line><line>Trucy:
W-Well...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
And your answer... is silence, I see. Very well! I move to...
</line><line>???:
...It's not nice to pick on the Fräulein, Klavier.
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Ema:
Well? Like my Kristoph Gavin impression? Did I sound like him?

</line><line>Ema:
Someone had to come dig you all out of the mess you're making of this case.

Mess...?
</line><line>Ema:
You know, none of this would happen if you just trusted in science a little more. You can find out if that stamp was in that envelope, easy.
</line><line>Klavier:

</line><line>Ema:
Glare at me all you want, but science is on my side. It's all in the <textEffects>residue</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Apollo:
That's right! The poison detection spray...
</line><line>Judge:
Produce the <textEffects>red envelope</textEffects> at once! You can open it on the authority of the court!
</line>

<line>Judge:
Well! Would you look at that!
</line><line>Ema:
No mistaking it. That's atroquinine residue!
</line><line>Judge:

...It boggles my mind that so many people haven't noticed this. There's a fatal contradiction in Herr Forehead's claim!
</line><line>Apollo:
A c-contradiction?
</line><line>Klavier:
A poisoned stamp was placed in this envelope seven years ago. Whereupon it was framed, until now. If that's the case, then why would Drew Misham have done what he did?
</line><line>Apollo:
E-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned!
</line><line>Klavier:
...Therein lies the rub.
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Seven years ago, the forger Drew Misham sensed a trap, and put the stamp in a frame. I do not debate this. ...But this begs the question. Why, seven years later, did he use that stamp on the night of the murder?
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Surely, you don't mean to suggest that Mr. Misham simply "forgot"? He put the murder weapon in a frame on his desk for seven years... and forgot? You expect us to believe he sprang the trap on himself?
</line><line>Apollo:
...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
While I admit, this is all quite shocking, myself... ...it does seem highly unlikely that he would fall afoul of a trap... ...that had been sitting on his desk for seven years!
</line><line>Trucy:
A-Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't think we're winning anymore.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, I'm glad to see we're all back in the real world now. Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
OK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope?
</line><line>Klavier:
The "poisoned stamp"...? Where exactly is this poisoned stamp, again? Have you brought it to court for us?
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh...
</line><line>Klavier:
I see no proof that such a thing ever existed.
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
What about the atroquinine residue, huh!?
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, I agree, that does seem to be atroquinine residue. But, Herr Forehead, it's certainly no stamp.
</line><line>Apollo:
...! Y-Yeah, but...
</line><line>Klavier:
Even if your precious poisoned stamp did exist... ...Drew Misham never would have used it. ...That is all.
</line><line>Apollo:
...... Urk.
</line><line>Judge:
I believe we've come to a conclusion. Again.
</line><line>Trucy:
A-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time?
</line><line>Apollo:
I-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence!
</line><line>Judge:
I'd like to bring some closure to this issue, sometime this year. ...Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Let's review the facts, and see where we stand. Seven years ago, Drew Misham received a red envelope. There were traces of the poison atroquinine on the document inside that envelope. A similar trace was also found at the crime scene... ...on this tiny picture frame. The defense has indicated the possibility of a <textEffects>yellow envelope</textEffects>. An envelope that left the scene of the crime with the poisoned stamp on it.
</line><line>Klavier:
Yes, but even if this envelope contained a poisoned stamp... ...and Drew Misham, knowing this, put it in a frame... ...he never would have used that stamp!
</line><line>Judge:
...I'm afraid you're right. Which means there is a fatal flaw in the defense's case!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice, do you have a conclusion for us?
</line><line>Apollo:
...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Klavier:
Ah, a fake clue? Fascinating! And if we find this fake, your wild fantasies will prove quite reasonable, ja?
</line><line>Apollo:
The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...
</line>



<line>Judge:
Th-the victim was a "fake clue"? I'm afraid I don't understand.
</line><line>Apollo:
...I'll explain. We have an <textEffects>envelope</textEffects>, a <textEffects>frame</textEffects>, and a <textEffects>mug</textEffects>, linked by poison. That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the <textEffects>victim himself</textEffects>!
</line><line>Klavier:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Klavier:
...Congratulations. You've completely lost me. So the fake evidence is none other than the master of fake himself, the forger? ...It makes a good story, I'll give you that.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(The fake clue... <span style="color:#E16935">Fakes</textEffects>... <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>...)</span> Ah...!
</line><line>Trucy:
I know that face! That's the "I just had an idea" face!
</line><line>Apollo:
I don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our "<textEffects>forger</textEffects>" is the "<textEffects>fake</textEffects>"!?
</line><line>Klavier:
...Come again?
</line><line>Apollo:
Seven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why?
</line><line>Judge:
That's what I want to know!
</line><line>Apollo:
Because the forger who was killed... was a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>.
</line><line>Klavier:
Here we are again. The victim... was a "fake"?
</line><line>Apollo:
One <textEffects>forger</textEffects> smelled the trap. One <textEffects>forger</textEffects> fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!!
</line><line>Klavier:
So you are telling us that Drew Misham, the victim, was a fake? Well, if he was the fake, who was the <textEffects>real</textEffects> forger? You'd better not be claiming there was some kind of switcheroo?
</line><line>Judge:
...I'm afraid you're going to have to back up your story. Mr. Justice. Show us just who the real <textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects> was!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(If Drew Misham wasn't the <span style="color:#E16935">real forger</textEffects>... ...there's only one other person it could have been!)</span> ...Understood, Your Honor. Forger Drew Misham was himself a <textEffects>forgery</textEffects>! The real forger was...!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
There can be only one explanation, really. The real identity of the <textEffects>forger</textEffects> known as <textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects> is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Justice! This is going out on a limb, even for you!
</line><line>Trucy:
I kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger?
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. <textEffects>Forgery</textEffects> had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that <textEffects>trap</textEffects> seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the <textEffects>forger</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Well... Actually, that does make a certain kind of sense.
</line><line>Apollo:
One more thing! Only <textEffects>two sets of fingerprints</textEffects> were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's.
</line><line>Klavier:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
If we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well?
</line><line>Klavier:
...... ...Fascinating!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Vera Misham...?
</line><line>Vera:
......
</line><line>Judge:
You've been paying attention to the trial so far?
</line><line>Vera:
......
</line><line>Klavier:
Let's just ask her and be done with it, shall we? Who are you? Who is the <textEffects>forger</textEffects>, <textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects>?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...! ......
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
...I'm used to being stared at by Fräuleins, believe me. Though they usually talk to me, too. Tell us. Were you the one who forged those works of art?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...Yes...
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
So... so the <textEffects>forger</textEffects>, <textEffects>Drew Misham</textEffects> was... you!?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...Yes, it was me...
</line><line>Judge:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?

Trucy:
OK... So where exactly does this leave us, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, the Drew Misham who was killed... ...wasn't "Drew Misham the forger", basically.
</line><line>Trucy:
Huh? Well then, who was he?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well "he" was actually...
</line><line>Vera:
......
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(...Doing her nails.)</textEffects> So, you really made those <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...Yes... For Father... ...I know it was wrong...
</line><line>Trucy:
Could you tell us how it happened?
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...My father was a painter... ...I love painting ever since I was a child... ...One day, Father saw it in me... ...He saw that I had the "talent"...
</line><line>Trucy:
The talent... for making <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>?
</line><line>Vera:
...How should I say it? It was not only paintings I made... ...Given the materials, I could make... anything...
</line><line>Apollo:
Anything...?
</line><line>Vera:
...Father was so proud, and I, so happy... ...But, in the end, I was making... those...
</line><line>Apollo:
...<textEffects>Forgeries</textEffects>.
</line><line>Vera:
...I've never had a good constitution, nor... personality... ...I know very little of the world outside my door... ...... ...Now, because of me... Father... is...
</line><line>Trucy:
...Do you know about this red envelope?
</line><line>Vera:
...I remember that envelope. It was some time ago...
</line><line>Apollo:
So, you were already a, um... You were already creating your "<textEffects>works</textEffects>" back then?
</line><line>Vera:
...I started when I was only twelve years old...
</line><line>Apollo:
So the one who figured out the stamp was poisoned, that was...
</line><line>Bailiff:
...Mr. Justice! It's time! To the courtroom, please!
</line><line>Apollo:
R-Right! <textEffects>(Out of time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Wait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio...
</line><line>Vera:
...I painted those, as part of my work...
</line><line>Trucy:
Right. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings...
</line><line>Vera:
...I see... ...... ...Mr. Justice...
</line><line>Apollo:
...Yes!?
</line><line>Vera:
...Father... He knew of you... ...Of both of you...
</line><line>Apollo:
Your late father...?
</line><line>Vera:
...He was watching, gathering information... ...All about the "Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices"...
</line><line>Trucy:
B-But lately, we're not doing just law...!
</line><line>Vera:
...Yes... You do tricks, gags to amuse... and play piano...
</line><line>Trucy:
Well, they're not really "gags"...
</line><line>Vera:
...Yet when Father heard you had resumed the legal business... ...How pleased he was...
</line><line>Trucy:
...Who was Mr. Misham?
</line><line>Apollo:
...How'm I supposed to know?
</line><line>Trucy:
What if he was Daddy's Daddy?
</line><line>Apollo:
Judging from the relative ages involved, I'd say it's highly unlikely. <textEffects>(Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the <span style="color:#E16935">forger</textEffects>. What does this mean for the case...? Guess we're about to find out.)</span>

<textEffects>(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)</textEffects>

</line><line>Judge:
Very well, miss, if you would... ...did you really make those detestable <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Vera:
...!
</line><line>Klavier:
Perhaps you'd rather answer my question? Were you the one who painted that painting. The remarkably similar one?
</line><line>Vera:
...Ah... Yes... ...I painted it, yes... ...Father praised me quite highly for it...
</line><line>Judge:
So... she was the one who made the <textEffects>forgeries</textEffects>.
</line><line>Klavier:
Yet, she did not wish to reveal the truth of their operation. So the victim was a stand-in, a decoy. To the world at large, he was the forger, not her.
</line><line>Vera:
...... ...I've done... a bad thing. I have, haven't I...?
