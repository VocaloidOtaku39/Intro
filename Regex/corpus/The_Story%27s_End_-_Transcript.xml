Luke:
Where's Espella? Where could she be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no sign of her at all.
</line><line>Layton:
This is very strange... I've a feeling we're the only ones around.
</line><line>Luke:
P-Professor... Look at this!
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>North Parade Avenue</i>
</line><line>Luke:
Look! It's a new story!
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm? That means...that the parade has already taken place...
</line><line>Luke:
Anyway, let's read it!
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center">The Final Story
At the appointed place of ending, as twilight fades to darkness, the weaver of the Story will meet the Great Witch for the first and final time. The concluding scene will glow in the flames of great magic, as the teller of the Story is silenced forever. This evening, at the final witch trial, the legendary Great Witch will be consumed by her own flames. The town, finally freed from the shackles of the Story and witchcraft, will bathe in the morning light of the new dawning day. The new town will be aglow with freedom from the past and fresh hope for the future.</captions>
<hr />
<line>Layton:
Does this mean what I think it means...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-no way... That can't be!
</line><line>Maya:
Is this what that Great Witch meant?
</line><line>Layton:
Whatever the case, let's find Espella before panic spreads throughout the town.
</line><line>Phoenix:
We should probably split up. If only we had some leads...
</line><line>Layton:
The "appointed place of ending"... Perhaps this is referring to the town square, at which the parade always ends. ...While the "teller of the Story" can mean none other than Espella's father. As for being "silenced forever"... This is almost certainly an indication that he will lose his life.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In that case, Professor... the chances of Espella being at the town square are pretty high, right?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, Mr Wright. Let's head to the square and find her!

<line><i>Town Square</i>
</line><line>Luke:
...! It looks like everyone in the town is here!
</line><line>Layton:
It would appear that they all wish to see the "Final Story" with their own eyes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Professor, about this "Final Story"... Why would the Great Witch Bezella show up tonight, of all nights?
</line><line>Layton:
I have been wondering the same thing... She has never once shown herself before now. Perhaps the power of the Story is such that even the actions of the Great Witch are subject to its control...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And one more thing... Why in the world would the Storyteller write his own death into the Story?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed... There appear to be quite a few mysteries contained within this "Final Story". Although I suggest we don't dwell on them for the time being.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I agree. First things first, let's find Espella.

</line><line>Maya:
How are we ever going to find Espella with all these people about?
</line><line>Luke:
Ah! Look over there! It's the Storyteller!
</line><line>Storyteller:
...And now...the time is upon us... The time of release from the curses of witchcraft and the Story. The legendary Bezella will appear before us, and the Story of the longest night will begin. Prepare yourselves for the dramatic climax!

<captions aligned="center">But that means we'll lose our Storyteller!</captions>
<captions aligned="center">But why will he be sacrificed...?</captions>

Storyteller:
There is no reason for sorrow. My Stories are no more than a peek at the caprice and irony of unfolding fate. We are all being carried along on the vast and irresistible sea of chance. I am no more than one person in the sea of people who are here tonight. ...No more...and no less.

Look, everyone! The Great Witch Bezella has finally appeared. The time has arrived... This Story will come to an end.
</line><line>Man:
That must be her... Can it really be...?
</line><line>Woman:
The Great Witch Bezella!
</line><line>Storyteller:
Here and now, my life will surely come to an end. The Great Witch Bezella will be apprehended... and true peace will come to this town.

Espella...

<hr />
<line><i>Inside the Bell Tower</i>
</line><line>Vigilante:
So you WERE the Great Witch Bezella after all... A truly terrifying witch who would even attack her own father.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Get up! Get up and stand before us! Great Witch Bezella!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Espella!
</line><line>Maya:
It can't be...Espella... There's no way...
</line><line>Layton:
Espella, are you all right? ...Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are you okay, Espella?
</line><line>Layton:
She seems to be wide awake... But she's not responding.
</line><line>Maya:
I don't get it... What happened here?
</line><line>Eve:
...Meow...
</line><line>Maya:
Ah!
</line><line>Luke:
Hey, it's Eve! Eve, were you with Espella the whole time? Can you tell me what happened here?
</line><line>Eve:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
What did she say, Luke?
</line><line>Luke:
Nothing...she didn't tell me a thing.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Will you people keep your distance! I can't have you getting close to the Great Witch Bezella! Until the commencement of the final trial, this girl is to be handed over to the Knights of the Inquisition. Take her away!
</line><line>Vigilante:
Sir!
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! Don't you DARE lay a finger on her!
</line><line>Vigilante:
Surely you must have seen her just now! Tell me, did she or did she not just summon a great big fire dragon?!
</line><line>Maya:
But...you still can't say for sure that Espella is a witch!
</line><line>Luke:
That's right! Someone might've knocked her out and brought her here against her will!
</line><line>Vigilante:
...Hm?! That's ridiculous. We Vigilantes were the first ones at this tower. And when we arrived, this girl was the only person present! Any one of us would swear to it on their honour as a knight.
</line><line>Layton:
Things are not always as they might appear. You have yet to investigate the scene of the incident, have you not?
</line><line>Vigilante:
There's no need! It's obvious beyond a shadow of a doubt what has transpired here. Oi, get a move on! Take that girl away before she regains consciousness!
</line><line>Vigilante:
But, sir...there seems to be some kind of commotion downstairs...'
</line><line>Vigilante:
What?!
</line><line>???:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">You take your hands off that young girl! I'm family!</captions>
<line>
Vigilante:
H-hey, you... Cease! ...?!
</line><line>Patty:
You lot just keep your grubby meathooks off my little Espella!
</line><line>Maya:
Ah! B-boss...
</line><line>Patty:
Maya! Phoenix!
</line><line>Vigilante:
Who let this woman up here? Remove her immediately!
</line><line>Vigilante:
...Sir!
</line><line>Patty:
Don't you lay a hand on me! Take that!
</line><line>Vigilante:
*cough* *cough* What is that...*splutter*...white powder?!
</line><line>Patty:
That's my very finest white flour! Be thankful of that, you whippersnapper.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Why you...you impudent...bread-brained baker!
</line><line>Patty:
Go ahead and draw that sword at your own risk, sonny! I'll show you a thing or two. The rolling pin is mightier than the sword!
</line><line>Maya:
Don't you have anything better to do than intimidate defenceless women? You...dork in a tin can!
</line><line>Vigilante:
Wh-what is it with you people...?
</line><line>Layton:
I understand how you two feel, but may I ask you both to calm down a little?
</line><line>Maya:
P-Professor!
</line><line>Layton:
We are the only ones who can discover the truth and save Espella.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The professor's right. We have to keep our cool and carefully plan our next move.
</line><line>Patty:
I know, Phoenix. And to think...the Phoenix I once knew could barely even plan his next loaf of bread.
</line><line>Layton:
If you'll excuse us, we must be on our way.
</line><line>Vigilante:
...Hm?! Now why couldn't you just leave peacefully in the first place?
</line><line>Patty:
Espella! Espella! I still believe in you, my dear girl.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Take the girl away! ...That means now!
</line><line>Vigilante:
I'm afraid, sir...that won't exactly...be completely possible at the present time, sir!
</line><line>Vigilante:
What now?!
</line><line>Vigilante:
A moment ago, that new recruit got carried away and locked the entrance. Currently no one is able to leave the tower...sir.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Wh-what did you say?! That idiot of a new recruit did WHAT?! We've been ordered to take this girl to the interrogation room as soon as possible! The trial of the Great Witch is tonight! The appropriate arrangements are already under way in the square. We don't have time for this!
</line><line>Vigilante:
S-sorry, sir! I'll go and hang that new recruit up by his heels!
</line><line>Vigilante:
Pssh... We're leaving now and that's that! Bring that witch here to me!
</line><line>Maya:
Looks like they took Espella away with them...
</line><line>Luke:
That made my blood boil! Having to just stand here and watch her get dragged away like that...
</line><line>Layton:
We must bide our time, Luke. Don't worry, the time for action will come.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Although, at present...this place is still in complete turmoil.
</line><line>Luke:
Look, there are Vigilantes and knights running all over the place!
</line><line>Maya:
That oversized rust bucket said the trial will be held tonight, didn't he?
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, that would seem to be the case... According to the Storyteller's Story, at least.

<line><b>The Great Witch Bezella used a spell to call forth a fire dragon which then took the Storyteller's life. Could it be that Espella really is the Great Witch Bezella?</b>

</line><line>Barnham:
I simply...cannot comprehend it. Storyteller... Can this really be a suitable ending to the Story you have written? As a father, how can you possibly subject your own daughter to a fate such as this?!
</line><line>Knight:
Inquisitor Barnham! We have the Great Witch in custody!
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmm...you took your time, did you not? How long is it now since the incident?
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir, sorry, sir! It look longer than expected on account of those incompetent Vigilantes. They've only just handed her over to us.
</line><line>Barnham:
Your excuses do not interest me. You do realise that according to the Story, the trial of the Great Witch must convene this evening, do you not?
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! Arrangements for the setting up of the special outside court have commenced.
</line><line>Barnham:
I wanted to gain as much information as possible before the proceedings begin. There is little time left, so get going!
</line><line>Knight:
Y-yes, sir! You heard the inquisitor, witch! Get moving!
</line><line>Barnham:
...Stop! Do not treat the accused like that.
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! Sorry, sir! But, sir, this girl's accused of...
</line><line>Barnham:
I know very well what she is accused of... But for the time being, that is precisely what she is: "accused". Not "guilty".
</line><line>Knight:
I-Inquisitor Barnham...
</line><line>Barnham:
This girl is not a witch until she has been pronounced guilty. Treat her with respect... That is an order!
</line><line>Knight:
Y-yes, sir!
</line><line>Barnham:
Espella Cantabella... I would like to hear the truth from you.
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
Are you really...the Great Witch Bezella?
</line><line>Espella:
...I...I'm...
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Go and prepare for questioning. ...I shall be along shortly!
</line><line>???:
...That won't be necessary.
</line><line>Barnham:
I-Inquisitor Darklaw! What... What did you just say?
</line><line>Darklaw:
I said, that will not be necessary. You see, this evening...you will not be the one standing in court.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what is the meaning of this?! Who, then? Who will stand in court?
</line><line>Darklaw:
For the trial of the Great Witch Bezella, surely it is only fitting that the High Inquisitor herself prosecute.
</line><line>Barnham:
Y-you're not saying...
</line><line>Darklaw:
I'm saying that I will be filling the role of inquisitor in tonight's trial. Is that understood, Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
High Inquisitor... Just what are you planning?
</line><line>Darklaw:
...I'm not sure I quite follow. What are you implying?
</line><line>Barnham:
I followed after you...and my pursuit led me into a mysterious forest. Upon doing so, I witnessed a most unusual scene... Several mysterious robed figures surrounding a character whom they referred to as the "Great Witch". The "Great Witch" hiding behind that masked exterior...was none other than you, High Inquisitor Darklaw!
</line><line>Darklaw:
My, my, Inquisitor. How very...interesting. And where, may I ask, is your proof of this?
</line><line>Barnham:
P-proof?! Well...
</line><line>Darklaw:
Did you not even remove the mask to confirm the identity of that person?
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Darklaw:
Well...?
</line><line>Barnham:
I was unable to confirm anything. Thanks to her use of witchcraft, I was robbed of consciousness.
</line><line>Darklaw:
Is that so...? In that case, Barnham, I'm afraid... I will have to treat what you have just said as treason.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
And treason against the High Inquisitor means treason against the Storyteller. You there!
</line><line>Knight:
Y-yes, Milady!
</line><line>Darklaw:
Escort Zacharias Barnham to the dungeon for his crime of treason.
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, Mi... MILADY?!
</line><line>Darklaw:
On second thought...he may prove a handful for the likes of you men alone. I shall come along and assist your escort. Now, ready the horses.
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! I mean, Milady!
</line><line>Darklaw:
Wait right here, Barnham. We're taking you into immediate custody.
</line><line>Barnham:
...! I do not believe it... I will not believe it... I cannot believe that Espella Cantabella... is the Great Witch Bezella. Blast! Of all the times...
</line><line>Knight:
Inquisitor Barnham... Please know that it pains me to restrain the great defender of Labyrinthia...
</line><line>Barnham:
...There is no need to apologise. I am aware that you are only doing your duty.
</line><line>Knight:
B-but, sir...
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof, woof, ruff!
</line><line>Barnham:
Constantine! What are you doing here, boy?
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof, ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Barnham:
............ My faithful companion, Constantine. I'm sorry to say...it appears that your master has reached the end of his career.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Barnham:
A great task has befallen me, but now I shall be unable to complete it. It's such a pity...
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof, woof! Ruff! Woof, woof!
</line><line>Darklaw:
Ugh...this is pitiful... The once-great Inquisitor Barnham... conveying words of remorse to his faithful dog...
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Darklaw:
And what, may I ask, was this "great task" of which you spoke?
</line><line>Barnham:
That's simple...to find the truth.
</line><line>Darklaw:
The "truth"...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Until I met Sir Blue Knight and Sir Dark Hat, the question hadn't occurred to me. Is Espella Cantabella really the Great Witch Bezella? Why would the Storyteller write a Story in which his own daughter is executed? I, Zacharias Barnham, as a defender of this town, must know the truth behind this!
</line><line>Darklaw:
............ I'll tell you one thing, Inquisitor Barnham. I'll tell you why you were unable to find the truth.
</line><line>Barnham:
What is the reason?
</line><line>Darklaw:
There is one thing which, despite your great ability, you lack.
</line><line>Barnham:
Something I lack...?
</line><line>Darklaw:
What you lack is...resolve.
</line><line>Barnham:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Darklaw:
In order to find out the truth, you went to great lengths in following me to the woods. I don't reproach you for that. You felt it was your duty as a knight. But that's also the problem, Inquisitor. Why could you not go to such lengths when it came to doubting the Storyteller himself?
</line><line>Barnham:
That...that's crazy! It's not right for a knight to question the integrity of his lord and master!
</line><line>Darklaw:
And so you failed. Your knightly pride was your critical flaw.
</line><line>Barnham:
Huh...? Critical flaw?
</line><line>Darklaw:
That tower... the one in which the Storyteller lives... Perhaps the truth you were seeking could have been found in the small room at the very top of that tower.
</line><line>Barnham:
What...what are you saying...?!
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof!
</line><line>Darklaw:
In any case...at this stage of the game, it's too late to do anything. So I suggest you assign your unfinished task to that faithful dog of yours...
</line><line>Barnham:
Arrgh...
</line><line>Darklaw:
Very well then, Zacharias Barnham, it's time to go. From this evening you'll be spending your time in a damp, dark place...deep underground. It might be a good opportunity for you to cool that hot head of yours.
</line><line>Constantine:
...Ruff! Ruff, ruff, woof!

<line><i>Town Square</i>
</line><line>Maya:
Phew... We finally made it out of that tower.
</line><line>Luke:
I second that feeling. For a moment there, I wondered if we'd make it out safely...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's probably not much time until Espella's trial begins. I say we look around for clues, so we at least have something to go on.
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed, that sounds like a wise suggestion. However, if it's all right with you, I'd like you to take charge of this particular investigation, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-sure, no problem. But...what about you, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Me? Why, there is a place of particular interest that I would like to investigate.
</line><line>Maya:
A place you'd like to investigate? Where's that, Professor?
</line><line>Constantine:
Ruff! Woof, woof!
</line><line>Luke:
Ah! Constantine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-whoa! Where the heck did he come from?!
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Ruff, ruff, woof!
</line><line>Layton:
Constantine looks rather worked up... Could something be the matter with him?
</line><line>Luke:
I don't know... I'll ask him and see.
</line><line>Layton:
Ah, good idea, Luke.
</line><line>Constantine:
Ruff...ruff! Woof!
</line><line>Luke:
Hmm...hmm...
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof! Ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
Eh?! No, surely not...
</line><line>Layton:
What is it, my boy? You look like you've just seen a ghost!
</line><line>Maya:
What did the little guy say?
</line><line>Luke:
He... He said...his master... Inquisitor Barnham has been relieved of his duties!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean...Inquisitor Barnham is no longer "Inquisitor" Barnham...? But why?!
</line><line>Constantine:
Ruff, woof...ruff, woof, woof!
</line><line>Luke:
Apparently, he's been branded a traitor for treason against the Storyteller.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Barnham...a traitor?
</line><line>Layton:
How very peculiar... This has all happened rather too hastily for my liking.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that's true...then who's going to take his place as prosecutor in the trial this evening?
</line><line>Luke:
Well, according to Constantine... that will be High Inquisitor Darklaw herself!
</line><line>Maya:
High Inquisitor Darklaw...
</line><line>Layton:
...It would appear this incident has taken a further turn for the dramatic. We would be wise to attend to our respective investigations without further delay.
</line><line>Luke:
Just a moment, Professor! It seems Constantine wants to tell us something else...
</line><line>Layton:
I'd be very interested to hear anything you wish to add, Constantine.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof! Ruff, ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
It appears he'd like to show us the way.
</line><line>Maya:
Show us the way? Show us the way to where?
</line><line>Luke:
He, uh...wants to show us the way to... the Storyteller's Tower.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Storyteller's Tower...? Why there?
</line><line>Luke:
According to Constantine... There should be a vital clue up there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A vital clue?!
</line><line>Layton:
Ho ho! This is most fortuitous.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
P-Professor...?
</line><line>Layton:
It just so happens that when I said there was a place I wished to investigate... that tower is precisely where I meant.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! No kidding...
</line><line>Layton:
For the time being, everyone's attention is focused on the town square. So perhaps it might just be possible to enter that tower while it's not being quite so heavily guarded. At least, I presume that may be the case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You may have just found a chink in their armour, Professor.
</line><line>Maya:
Isn't that tower where Espella used to live when she was a kid? Hmm... What kind of clue do you think could be hiding up there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe the clue lies in Espella's past...
</line><line>Constantine:
Ruff! Ruff! Woof, woof!
</line><line>Luke:
Constantine says he knows a shortcut... He can lead us straight to the Storyteller's Tower. "Follow me, Sir Top Hat"...he said!
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright, I suggest we split up into two groups.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, Professor. Be careful up there!
</line><line>Layton:
Don't worry, I shall be sure to return... armed with that vital clue!
</line><line>Phoenix:
We'll be waiting for you! ...In the meantime, we'll make sure we're armed and ready for the trial.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright... Within the Final Story was written the following: "The town, finally freed from the shackles of the Story and witchcraft, will bathe in the morning light of the new dawning day. The new town will be aglow with freedom from the past and fresh hope for the future." If this Story is to have the finale that has been promised... Espella, too, will bathe in the morning light of that new dawning day.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm with you on that, Professor. Let's work together to make it happen!
</line><line>Layton:
Farewell for now, Mr Wright. Come on, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
Right you are, Professor! Come on, Constantine, show us the way!
</line><line>Constantine:
...Woof, woof!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
All right. Let's start by investigating the scene of the crime. We've only got a few hours until the trial starts. That doesn't give us much time... Let's go, Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure the professor will bring us back something we can work with. Let's be sure to hold up our end of the bargain.
</line><line>Maya:
You got it, Nick! ............
</line><line>Phoenix:
What is it, Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
It's Espella... Her eyes are all funny again, like last time...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Like last time...?
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, like they were back in London. I mean, it's like she's completely spaced out again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... Now that you mention it... <textEffects>(...It was almost like she was being controlled by some kind of drug or magic back then.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Nuh-uh, no way! This is just downright DISGUSTING! We can't let them get away with this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. We're definitely on the same page there, Maya. C'mon, let's get started.
</line><line>Maya:
You said it! I'm as serious as a heart attack, Nick!

Oh, come on, Maya. What do you expect when someone in a METAL suit bumps into someone in a CLOTH suit?
</line><line>Vigilante:
What are you two doing here, anyway? This area is supposed to be off limits to the likes of you.
</line><line>Maya:
We, um... Well, y'see, we're the ones defending Espella Cantabella.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Oh ho ho! Then you must be the "Sir Blue Knight" that all the town is talking about!
</line><line>Maya:
He sure is! Bluest knight in all the land!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That's right. I'm the Blue Knight.
</line><line>Vigilante:
Hmm...you look a little GREEN for a knight, if you ask me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um...thanks?
</line><line>Vigilante:
Well, feel free to investigate the area. Over in the square they're setting up the special outside court to be used in the upcoming trial. We Vigilantes are spread thin guarding here, so do your best to keep out of our way!
</line><line>Maya:
Well, there he goes. Y'know, Nick...you're becoming quite the <textEffects>celebrity</textEffects> around here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm not sure <textEffects>celebrity</textEffects> is quite the right word. ...Hmm?
</line><line>Maya:
What's up, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like the Vigilante that ran into me just dropped something.
</line><line>Maya:
What is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like some kind of <textEffects>patrol record</textEffects> for the guards.
</line><line>Maya:
...Patrol record?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Judging by what's written here, it looks like they've been taking turns guarding this bell tower 24/7.
</line><line>Maya:
You mean they've been guarding it around the clock? Why would they do that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Beats me. But the important thing here... is the fact that it was under <textEffects>close guard</textEffects> at the time the incident took place.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, right... So I guess it would've been impossible to just stroll in through the front door, huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. <textEffects>(Anyway, it might be a good idea to hold on to this for now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
So anyway, where were we? ...Oh, right! Off to see the crime scene!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Better have a look before another "dork in a tin can" shows up.

</line><line>Phoenix:
It looks like they've left the crime scene completely untouched.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah...even that flour the boss threw at them is still all over the place.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... I still can't believe she took on a bunch of fully armed Vigilantes...
</line><line>Maya:
With only a bag of white flour and a rolling pin, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just goes to show how much Patty cares for Espella, huh...
</line><line>Maya:
Of course she does! After all, Espella's like family. That's another reason we just HAVE to rescue Espella, Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right.
</line><line>Maya:
Then what are we waiting for? Let's bust out that magnifying glass and get this search on the road!

Nick!

Looks like we're out of time, Maya. I guess that's the end of this investigation.
</line><line>Maya:
You think we'll be all right? We didn't really have time to finish...
</line><line>Phoenix:
We did what we could in the time we had. Let's go... I have a feeling Espella's going to be moved to the defendant's waiting room soon.
</line><line>Maya:
............ You know, Nick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Hm? What?
</line><line>Maya:
I've been thinking... It's no accident that you and I found ourselves in Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya...
</line><line>Maya:
The reason we're here...is for the trial tonight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ I know what you mean... I think so too. And I'm sure Professor Layton and Luke feel the same way. I just know they'll bring back a clue or two to save Espella.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah...you're right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That means we've got to give this trial everything we've got, Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Okay, Nick! Let's do this thing!

You bet! We'll do what we do best. We'll fight to the very end...for Espella!

</line><line>Luke:
Professor...
</line><line>Layton:
What is it, my boy?
</line><line>Luke:
What do you think about what happened tonight?
</line><line>Layton:
Hmm... On the surface, it certainly did appear that the Storyteller's assailant... could be none other than Espella.
</line><line>Luke:
But...surely not!
</line><line>Layton:
However, even if it did seem that way, that does not necessarily make it the truth. And if it transpires that Espella is in fact innocent, then there must be some form of contradiction or proof to support as much.
</line><line>Luke:
............ Yes, you're right! I'll bet Mr Wright won't miss even the slightest shred of evidence.
</line><line>Layton:
Mr Wright and Maya are investigating the scene of the crime as we speak... We, meanwhile, must search for something to prove Espella's innocence. In doing so, the truth should become evident as a matter of course.
</line><line>Luke:
I see! In the time that I've spent with Espella, I've never once doubted her character... There's just no way she could do anything as terrible as what happened in that square. I believe in her, Professor.
</line><line>Layton:
I know you do, Luke. We are Espella's friends...and as such, we must believe in her.
</line><line>Luke:
Too right!
</line><line>Layton:
First, let's make our way through the gate.
</line><line>Luke:
Uh-oh! The door's still locked! And there are no knights here to open it.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof! Ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
What's the matter, Constantine?
</line><line>Constantine:
Ruff, ruff, ruff...woof!
</line><line>Luke:
That's great, thanks! He says there's another way in, which only the knights know about!
</line><line>Layton:
That's a relief... Could you show us the way, Constantine?
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof!

<line><i>Knights' Garrison</i>
</line><line>Knight:
Who'd have thought the Storyteller would come to such an end...? I'm still finding it hard to believe, even now. I mean, what's to become of us?
</line><line>Knight:
Hmph, wish I knew! I'm more worried about Inquisitor Barnham. He's being held on suspicion of treason... This whole thing is just one big headache... No matter what, the future ain't looking too bright!
</line><line>???:
Enough of your pathetic whining! You call yourselves knights?!
</line><line>Knight:
Oh! Captain!
</line><line>Captain:
The Storyteller's gone... Inquisitor Barnham's gone... And who do you think is suffering the most because of it? The townsfolk, that's who! It's now that they need us the most! We must be there for them, to offer our support!
</line><line>Knight:
Yes, sir! That's certainly true, but... with things the way they are, what can we possibly do...?
</line><line>Captain:
...Pitiful! ...Hmm? Over there, isn't that...
</line><line>Layton:
It would appear even the knights are unsettled, my boy.
</line><line>Luke:
What's going to become of Labyrinthia now?
</line><line>Layton:
Well, according to the Final Story, once all this is sorted out, there will be fresh hope for the future. So it's a little early to be losing heart just yet.
</line><line>Luke:
I hope you're right... Let's do our best to make it so, Professor! What's this? Someone's coming this way... Isn't that-
</line><line>Captain:
And what are you two doing here?
</line><line>Layton:
We're heading for the Storyteller's Tower. There may be something left to uncover, so we're going there now to find out.
</line><line>Captain:
Did you say...the Storyteller's Tower?
</line><line>Luke:
Uh-oh... I hope this doesn't mean we're about to be surrounded by knights pointing swords at us again...
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof, ruff, ruff, woof!
</line><line>Captain:
...! Well, if it isn't little Constantine! Oh, I see... This must mean you're working on behalf of Inquisitor Barnham... Well, in that case, the tower is up ahead! You may proceed. In fact, I insist that you proceed. I have a feeling there's some unfinished business that only you can take care of. For all our sakes...go there and fulfil your quest. ...And in doing so, show us all that there is still hope for the future of Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Luke:
Captain...
</line><line>Layton:
Very well. We shan't let you down. Let's go, Luke. The Storyteller's Tower stands right ahead of us.
</line><line>Luke:
Right you are, Professor!

<line><i>Audience Rm. Entrance</i>
</line><line>Luke:
Look! I can see the tower right over there! But how do we get to it?
</line><line>Layton:
I believe this may be where our little friend comes in handy... Wouldn't you say, Luke?
</line><line>Luke:
...Right. Of course!
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof, woof, ruff! Woof! Ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
Hmm...I see. You're saying there's a path? He says there's a path leading from behind the Audience Room right over to the Storyteller's Tower!
</line><line>Layton:
One could hardly ask for a better guide.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Woof! Woof!
</line><line>Luke:
Oh, really? He just said: "You've nothing to worry about while I'm here!" And then he added: "You might want to worry about that Sir Blue Knight, though." ............ I hope Mr Wright and Maya were able to come across some clues...
</line><line>Layton:
I don't think we need worry too much about them. I'm sure they'll be all right. Wouldn't you agree, my boy?
</line><line>Luke:
Of course, Professor! While I was teaming up with Mr Wright, one thing became clear to me... He's definitely someone that will always do his best to protect his friends!
</line><line>Layton:
I agree, Luke. He's a fine young lawyer with a heart of gold. I'm quite confident the trial is safe in his capable hands.
</line><line>Luke:
Me too! And then there's Maya...always strong and courageous! Not to mention full of energy! She's a bit reckless sometimes...but always with good intent!
</line><line>Layton:
We're lucky to have them on our side.
</line><line>Luke:
...I'm really glad we met them, aren't you, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Yes, Luke, I'd certainly agree with you there. Both Mr Wright and Miss Fey are friends that can truly be relied upon. But at the same time, High Inquisitor Darklaw will be a most formidable opponent. ...One unlikely to make any careless slips. Which is why we must all do our best and work together.
</line><line>Luke:
Including me, right?
</line><line>Layton:
Of course. I certainly couldn't do this without you, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
Don't worry, Professor! I'll give it everything I've got!
</line><line>Layton:
That's the spirit, my boy!

<line><i>Bridge to the Tower</i>
</line><line>Luke:
Wow! You don't realise how tall the tower is until you see it up close like this.
</line><line>Layton:
It certainly looks ominous in the moonlight.
</line><line>Luke:
There's a vital clue waiting for us here... isn't there, Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
That's what I'm counting on, Luke. And it would seem... that Inquisitor Barnham had the same idea.
</line><line>Luke:
That would explain why Constantine is helping us...
</line><line>Layton:
So this is the tower in which the Creator resides... The tower that none of the townsfolk, nor even the knights, dare visit.
</line><line>Luke:
It's surrounded in secrecy, that's for sure. It's a bit like the Eldwitch Woods...
</line><line>Layton:
Indeed. Those woods are certainly an enigma in themselves.
</line><line>Luke:
Not to mention those underground ruins... talk about mysterious places! If the Storyteller really did know everything about Labyrinthia... I'd have liked to have asked him a thing or two about them!
</line><line>Layton:
It's possible there may be clues related to those places, as well as a number of other matters, waiting for us within that tower. In which case, there could also be any manner of traps or contrivances awaiting us as well. We shall have to be doubly careful from here on in.
</line><line>Luke:
Got it, Professor!
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof! Ruff! Woof, woof!
</line><line>Luke:
...You've what? You've completed your mission? He says he's worried about his master and wants to return to him now.
</line><line>Layton:
We couldn't have come this far without your fine guidance, Constantine. We can take it from here.
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof, ruff, woof, woof, ruff!
</line><line>Luke:
Constantine says we're the ones his master chose, so he knows he can leave this quest with us in good faith.
</line><line>Layton:
We're honoured, Constantine. Thank you for your help.
</line><line>Luke:
Yes, thanks a lot! Take care on your way back!
</line><line>Constantine:
Woof!
</line><line>Layton:
Inquisitor Barnham loves this town more than anyone and has done his utmost to protect it. Let's bear that in mind too, Luke. We have a responsibility to fight to the end. For him and for everyone else in this town.
</line><line>Luke:
I'm ready if you are, Professor!

<line>Layton:
It seems the mechanisms put in place to protect the tower are still operating.
</line><line>Luke:
Does that mean we can't get inside?
</line><line>Layton:
No, I wouldn't say so... This particular mechanism is in the form of a puzzle. If we solve it, perhaps we can enter.
</line>

<line>
Luke:
Professor, you did it!
</line><line>Layton:
............
</line><line>Luke:
...Professor?
</line><line>Layton:
Doesn't it seem peculiar to you, Luke? To get here we had to make our way beyond the guard post and through the knights' garrison. That would normally be considered sufficient defence against intruders, or so one would imagine.
</line><line>Luke:
Yeah, I guess you're right... There were several knights around, as well.
</line><line>Layton:
And yet, in addition, we found that contrivance in place on the door. It would suggest to me that something of great importance must be contained within.
</line><line>Luke:
...Let's go on in and find out, Professor!

Oh, it was nothing. I can solve this kind of puzzle over tea and scones... just as any gentleman can.

Hm... I'm not sure I quite follow... But now's not the time to worry about that. We're doing our best to protect this town. Make sure you do your best too!
