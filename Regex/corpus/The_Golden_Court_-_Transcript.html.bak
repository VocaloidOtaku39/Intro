</line><line>Maya:
It doesn't make sense...*sob* How has it come to this...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The darned witch! Why did it have to happen to the professor, of all people?!
</line><line>Maya:
You've got to believe me, Nick! I may be a spirit medium, but I'm no witch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry, I know it wasn't you!
</line><line>Maya:
...Hmm? Say, have you seen Luke today?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I haven't seen him since last night. He was crying all night... I didn't know what to say to him...
</line><line>Maya:
No kidding... He's the one suffering the most from all this... Poor kid...
</line><line>Phoenix:
He probably needs some time alone with his grief. We should leave him be.
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah... He shouldn't have to see this trial. It'd be too hard for him.
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, it's Espella!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you doing here, Espella? Have you been cleared of the accusations?
</line><line>Espella:
No...not yet. If only it was that easy... It's just that... I'm not technically under arrest, so I got special permission to come here. I'm free to go wherever I like...within this building.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, I see...
</line><line>Espella:
Uhm... I... I heard about Mr Layton. It's awful... He was such a good man!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ I'm sorry, Espella.
</line><line>Espella:
Huh? What are you apologising for?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We were supposed to find clues connected to Bezella... but we couldn't find anything. And now the professor's been...
</line><line>Espella:
No, don't say that! It's not your fault! And I don't believe a word of what they say about Maya! She isn't a witch!
</line><line>Maya:
Thank you, Espella...
</line><line>Espella:
Uhm...Mr Wright... Do you mind if I assist you in court today?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Espella:
I...I know I may not be of much use... but I'll do what I can! I want to help you and Maya!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Espella...
</line><line>???:
...Excuse me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-you're...
</line><line>Greyerl:
Greyerl, butler of the late Master Belduke. I have come to enquire after Miss Maya. It is most regrettable what happened yesterday.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh, thank you for coming all the way here! ...Hmm? You look really pale, Jean. Are you all right?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Oh, please don't worry about me. It's merely that, since the incident, sleep has eluded me.
</line><line>Maya:
Oh...
</line><line>Greyerl:
I spent the night searching through Master's notes on alchemy. I hoped there may be some mention... of a method by which something turned to gold may be <textEffects>reverted</textEffects> back to its original form.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You were looking for a way to... rescue the professor?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Human fate is often cruel. But that's also why we must never lose hope.
</line><line>Maya:
Jean...
</line><line>Defender! Accused! The trial is about to start. Proceed to the chamber!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes, we're coming!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Cheer up, Maya! I'm not just going to let them sentence you!
</line><line>Maya:
I just wish all this would stop already. Whether someone's a "witch" or not... no one deserves to be burned!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know. I can't stand for it either.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ If you'll kindly excuse me now, I must return to my duties.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, no problem. We, uhm, appreciate you coming to see us. <textEffects>(Something's bothering me... Jean seems somewhat odd today.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
...Let's go, Mr Wright! The trial is about to begin!
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>Witches' Court</i>
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem... The trial of Maya Fey shall now begin, as scheduled. Knights of the Court, are you ready to cross your swords of justice?
</line><line>Barnham:
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham always has his sword ready for the work of justice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhh...defence ready, Your Honour. At this stage, I've just gotta give it all I've got!
</line><line>Judge:
............ It would appear the defender has <textEffects>thrown down the gauntlet</textEffects>, Sir Barnham. Now, before we begin...may I have a word with you, defender?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour!
</line><line>Judge:
Last time me met, you stood in this court as an apprentice baker. In all honesty, when I saw you for the first time, I thought to myself: "A baker should stick to bread baking."
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Is that so? <textEffects>(What a fine first impression I made...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
However, today you are not merely some befuddled maker of sweet buns. I am obliged to fully recognise you... as a knight of law and justice on par with Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Now, may your duel begin! Fight bravely and expose the truth behind this heinous crime!
</line>
<center>All right! We're all counting on you, Inquisitor Barnham!I knew she was a witch as soon as I laid my eyes on her! She's got "witch" written all over her!Why not put the baker on trial?! Bake the baker, I say!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They treat him like some sort of celebrity...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
He may be adored by the crowds, but when he pointed his sword my way, you managed to shield me from his accusations! Maya clearly isn't a witch! So surely your victory is certain!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you for believing in me, Espella.
</line><line>Barnham:
Espella Cantabella...
</line><line>Espella:
......!
</line><line>Barnham:
I have given you leave to come to this trial today. However, that does not mean... that the charges against you have been dropped. Rather than worry about others, you should consider your own situation!
</line><line>Espella:
............ Thank you for granting me your permission, Inquisitor.
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin your opening statement.
</line><line>Barnham:
As you wish, Milord. As usual, let us commence this trial by first recounting the events. If it pleases you, Sir Blue Knight...
</line><line>Phoenix:
As, uhm, you wish...Inquisitor. <textEffects>(I still can't get used to this terminology...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
This heinous crime occurred in the residence of the late Newton Belduke, the alchemist. Here is the sketched plan of his residence. This room, of a somewhat questionable nature, is the alchemist's study, in which the incident took place. The only ones present at the moment of the crime were the <textEffects>accused</textEffects> and the <textEffects>victim</textEffects>. No one else. The witnesses, who arrived at the scene seconds later, have indicated where they found the accused and the victim.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The sketch is accepted as evidence.
</line><line>Floor Plan added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Barnham:
The accused took Sir Layton's life with the most cruel of magic. A living man one second, a golden statue the next! Such wickedness!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Magic that turns things into gold? ...Sure, why not?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Several townspeople rushed to the room and paid witness to the horror of this magic. The accused has been captured and charged.
</line><line>Judge:
Goodness, that is terrifying! Rumours have reached me that the victim was a most scintillating man. I'm not quite certain whether it was prior to or after... But incidentally...was this <textEffects>Sir Layton</textEffects> not the same <textEffects>hat maker</textEffects> who attended our previous trial?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, no, he wasn't a hat ma-
</line><line>Barnham:
Bizarre as it is... Sir Layton's profession and origin remain unknown. He was a <textEffects>stranger</textEffects> in this city... that is all we know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
And you, sir, his acquaintance... You are an unusual presence in our city yourself.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph. Today's case certainly is peculiar.
</line><line>Barnham:
And that is not the last of the peculiarities, Milord. The alchemist's study has been the scene of <textEffects>another strange incident</textEffects> in the past...
</line><line>Judge:
Ah yes, I remember it as if it were yesterday. The mysterious death of Newton Belduke himself.
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed, Milord. Regrettably, the only case of witchcraft still to remain unsolved in our fair city. The witch may have escaped her punishment back then... but perhaps today is the day on which both these mysterious crimes shall be solved.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? Wh-what are you implying?!
</line><line>Barnham:
Patience! You will know soon enough, Sir Suddenly-Pale Blue Knight.
</line><line>Judge:
How interesting. It seems that the inquisition have something up their sleeve. Now, Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
</line><line>Barnham:
Thank you, Milord. The inquisition summons the witnesses to this malicious crime of witchcraft!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If only... If only I'd made it to the room sooner... Maybe I could've prevented all this from happening... I won't let Maya take the rap for this! I'll find every single crack in their testimony and prove it wasn't her!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Welcome to the Witches' Court, honourable witnesses. Now, let us hear your names and occupations.
</line><line>Emeer:
I am known far and wide as Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the new head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
W-wait a minute, witness!
</line><line>Emeer:
What's that, blue squire?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're...that guy from the previous trial! Just...what the heck's happened to you? You look like you've been on one of those "ultimate makeover" shows...
</line><line>Emeer:
............ Whatever do you mean? Me name is Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-what is the meaning of this, Inquisitor?
</line><line>Barnham:
I do not care to delve into this witness' <i>[sic]</i> personal affairs.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like he remembers him all too well...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Witnesses, pray continue.
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me. It is I who usually asks the questions... I am, you see, but a humble teacher. Call me Ms Primstone. The children of Labyrinthia Primary School have the privilege of learning the truths about this world from me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(An elementary school teacher, huh... Good to know at least one witness seems sensible.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Birdly:
</line>
<center>♪The winds carry my song, it's Birdly Stringing along! Parrot and bard, ensemble avant-garde!♪</center>
<line>My faithful muse, here, is Cracker the musical parrot. No one understands music like Cracker. Aside from me, naturally.
</line><line>Cracker:
Oh dearie, dearie me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(At least it's not another goat...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
What a smart bird! He just imitated that teacher perfectly!
</line><line>Luke:
I'm Luke Triton. My occupation is... the professor's apprentice!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Luke?
</line>
<center>Luke! But...why?!</center>
<line>
Luke:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you doing there?
</line><line>Luke:
...I made up my mind. I'm doing this for the professor! A gentleman has to pursue the truth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But...Luke. That's where the <textEffects>inquisition's</textEffects> witnesses stand!
</line><line>Luke:
I...I'll never... I'll never forgive that witch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A gentleman shouldn't glare at people as if he wants to hit them in the face...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
L-Luke...
</line><line>Barnham:
"Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow." Such is the hard reality of the battlefield.
</line><line>Judge:
Witnesses, we will now hear your testimonies. Tell us all of this wicked incident, which you have been unfortunate enough to witness.

<center><textEffects>- What We Witnessed -</textEffects></center>
<line>Emeer:
I heard a scream and an incantation, and then when I entered the room, the victim was already all shiny!
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Mayhap something caused discord between erstwhile friends? Mr Silk Hat had a knife at the ready, in his hand!
</line><line>Birdly:
</line>
<center>♪Victim of magic, sparkly and done for, I heard the staff fall on the floor♪</center>
<line>
Luke:
The professor must have seen through Miss Maya's deception and confronted her right there, face-to-face!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I see... Thank you all... However, one part of the testimony was somewhat confusing... You there...the singer...
</line><line>Birdly:
Singer? Could you possibly mean me, Birdly the bard, Your Excellence?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that would be you, singer. This "staff" that you said...sung about...
</line><line>Barnham:
It is as you suspect, Milord. This very <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Espella:
There are two different magic gems attached, meaning the perpetrator could have used two types of magic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah...it would seem so.
</line><line>Barnham:
This gem here enables the use of a <textEffects>gold</textEffects> transmutation spell, "<textEffects>Goldor</textEffects>".
</line><line>Judge:
"Goldor"... Just the word alone makes the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
</line><line>Emeer:
Har har har, that's the one, all right! That's the dreadful incantation that I, Emeer Punchenbaug I, also heard!
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! I have seen that sceptre, so I have!
</line><line>Birdly:
</line>
<center>♪Clank! Tips over the golden man! The sceptre falls. Not the witch's plan!♪</center>
<line>
Cracker:
Oh dearie, dearie me!
</line><line>Luke:
How dare she do that to the professor!
</line><line>Barnham:
By the way, this witch's sceptre was found on the floor, near the victim. If you'll turn your attention to the sketched plans, it was located right here. A sceptre dropped by the accused would naturally tumble to exactly that spot.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham! What you're saying amounts to nothing more than a baseless assumption!
</line><line>Barnham:
You are on edge today, Sir Blue Knight. Is it because your friend is on trial? Perhaps you had better cool yourself down.
</line><line>Judge:
...Well, anyway. The court accepts the sceptre as evidence.
</line><line>Barnham:
Thank you, Milord.
</line><line>Talea Magica added to the Court Record.
</line><line>The spell Goldor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you something?
</line><line>Barnham:
What is it now, Sir Blue Knight?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We know that one of the gems is for the spell Goldor, but what about the other one?
</line><line>Barnham:
A naive question...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
Naivety may be no hindrance to a baker, who spends most of his time amidst bread. But it can be your undoing here in court. Would a knight put a weapon in his enemy's hand?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's telling me to do my homework, huh.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
Mr Wright! I'll look for information about that magic gem in the Grand Grimoire!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Espella. That would be great.
</line><line>Espella:
Just leave it to me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She seems very happy to help.)</textEffects>

The professor threatened Maya with a knife? <textEffects>(That sounds hard to believe!)</textEffects>

Perhaps he discovered that she was a witch, or she tried to attack him first. Ms Primstone's lesson number seven! "Secrets lead to nothing but trouble." From the smallest of secrets can sprout the largest of arguments! This one is going to be in the exam!

</line><line>Phoenix:
That's merely your assumption! Now, Mr Birdly... Did you actually see Maya drop a sceptre? Or did you just hear something tumbling on the floor?
</line><line>Birdly:
............ I must confess, my eyes were rather more drawn towards the brilliantly glistening golden statue. I did not witness the witch dropping the sceptre, no. But I did hear it...and my sense of hearing is peerless!

<line>Phoenix:
Luke, you said that you will only believe what you see with your own eyes. But what you think you saw may not be the whole truth.
</line><line>Luke:
Huh? What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a close look at the sketch of the crime scene... At the time of the incident, Professor Layton and Maya were standing here. Now, we have learned from Ms Primstone's testimony <textEffects>which way</textEffects> the professor was facing. He was facing this way.
</line><line>Luke:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You have testified that the professor confronted Maya <textEffects>face-to-face</textEffects>. But looking at the sketch of where they were standing, one thing is clear... There is a contradiction in your testimony!

Uwaah?!

Whether they were facing each other or not is of no relevance whatsoever! They were the only ones in that room. One was a victim, thus the other must be the witch!

</line><line>Phoenix:
I will ask you to wait before jumping to conclusions, Inquisitor. Think back to Ms Primstone's testimony... She told us that the professor was <textEffects>pointing a knife</textEffects> at someone, threateningly.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
However, you can see in the sketch that he wasn't threatening Maya. So then, who was he pointing the knife at?

</line><line>Phoenix:
Luke...what is it?
</line><line>Luke:
The professor would never point a knife at anyone! I was the one who opened the door to that room, so I was the first witness...and I saw no knife! Miss Primstone's testimony is not reliable!
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Oh, dearie me! Will you look at this child, sputtering nonsense and talking badly of his elders!
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes, Milord?
</line><line>Judge:
It should pose no difficulty to verify whether or not the victim had a knife. After all, that...sparkling golden <textEffects>body</textEffects> of his has been found at the scene of the crime, has it not?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Indeed it has, Milord. Court attendants! You heard the judge! Bring the <textEffects>victim</textEffects> into the courtroom!

So this is the power of the gold transmutation spell. Most spectacular... It looks like the work of the finest artisans!
</line><line>Barnham:
I assure you it is the work of no artisans, Milord. By the way, the missing <textEffects>arm</textEffects> has not yet been found.
</line><line>Luke:
I...I can't believe this! Professor...

I suppose we should add the victim to the evidence.

This is unfortunate... I thought the evidence would be as good as gold... but although it technically is, we are still no closer to discerning whether or not the victim was holding a knife.

</line><line>Phoenix:
But...it's true that someone else could have been at the crime scene! Look at the sketch! The victim was facing towards <textEffects>someone</textEffects>, and that person wasn't Maya!
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, your ignorance is no longer even a surprise.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
You do not know what transpired at the crime scene. You think this man was pointing at another person, you say? Let me tell you this. Nearly everyone in this court other than you knows <textEffects>what</textEffects> Sir Hat was pointing at.
</line><line>Luke:

<center>♪The truth obscured by a twisted ruse, The witch couldn't vanish but did confuse♪</center>
<line>
Luke:
It happened because the professor unravelled the mystery behind all these witches...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The "same magic trick" was used?
</line><line>Barnham:
They are referring to an incident from three months ago. Much like this incident, a man lost his life to witchcraft in that very room.
</line><line>Judge:
It was the master of that residence, Sir Newton Belduke, the <textEffects>alchemist</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
He suffered death by strangulation... <textEffects>Finger marks</textEffects> were left on his neck. He had locked himself in his study, and the key was still in his pocket.
</line><line>Judge:
In other words, <textEffects>no one</textEffects> could have entered that room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The perpetrator disappeared from a locked room...just like in this case.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
A large amount of powdered medicine was spilt all over the floor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Powdered medicine?
</line><line>Judge:
Sir Belduke was an alchemist. He possessed various medicinal concoctions.
</line><line>Barnham:
Due to the presence of that powder, had anyone entered that room, clear footprints would have remained. Yet there were <textEffects>none</textEffects>.
</line><line>Luke:
That's the kind of mystery that the professor would have loved to solve...
</line><line>Judge:
Thus there were two unnatural circumstances to Sir Belduke's death. The culprit's disappearance from a locked room... and the fact that they appeared not to have walked on the floor. It's almost as if they flew away.
</line><line>Espella:
In other words, it couldn't have been the "Dimere" magic that was used in my case the other day...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Seems like the killer levitated above the floor, strangled Belduke and vanished into thin air...)</textEffects> But what does that have to do with this trial?
</line><line>Barnham:
It has been three months since that murder. Despite that, we still haven't been able to find the witch responsible. But now, having eluded us for so long... that witch has finally been brought before this court! We will have justice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-whaaat?! <textEffects>(No way... Now he thinks Maya killed the alchemist, too. We weren't even here back then... But it's not like I can explain that to him.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Well then, why don't you interrogate the witnesses? ...Now that you are aware of the connection between the two murders.
</line><line>Phoenix:

Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! I'm afraid even I did not notice it!
</line><line>Barnham:
It is indeed astonishing that the arm could have disappeared from the crime scene.
</line><line>Luke:
The professor will need his arm when he returns to normal! It's an all-out robbery! Go and investigate it!
</line><line>Barnham:
The boy's request is not unreasonable. I will order our Occult Crime Analysts to search for it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How could the arm just up and vanish from the crime scene? That just might be the <span style="color:#E16935">clue</textEffects> I need to give me the upper hand over Barnham...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
The court considers the whereabouts of the arm irrelevant to this trial. Mr Wright, make sure that you limit your interrogation to relevant matters.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, continue with the interrogation.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's talking about Luke, huh...)</textEffects> And when you entered the room, you saw the victim pointing at something?
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Pointing a knife, no less. A knife! As I told you before, it was a sharp, glittering knife. The poor man thought a knife would work on a familiar! Had he attended my classes, he would have known better.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In any case, there's no proof that the victim actually had a knife. <textEffects>(It's certain now that the professor and Maya <span style="color:#E16935">weren't facing each other</textEffects>.)</span>

</line><line>Judge:
What did he lie to you about?

I'll tell you! On the day of the crime, Emeer came to my shop... He waltzed up to me saying he'd got his hands on a superb work of art, rare as gold dust!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think I know where this is going...
</line><line>Barnham:
That "work of art"...could it be...?
</line><line>Price:
I've got it right here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just like I thought...
</line><line>Barnham:
That's...!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh my...
</line><line>Luke:
Professor... It's the professor's arm!
</line><line>Price:
It's pure gold, exquisitely crafted. It was entitled...hmm..."<textEffects>Towards Tomorrow</textEffects>", or something like that. I'd never seen a piece of gold so fine before... And so, suspecting nothing, I paid that rascal a rather handsome sum.
</line><line>Judge:
Who would have thought...
</line><line>Price:
And what am I hearing now?! That it was a human arm, no less! You, sir, are a <textEffects>monster</textEffects>! You're as bad as a <textEffects>witch's familiar</textEffects> yourself!
</line><line>Emeer:
I didn't know it was his arm, I swear! When I saw it, it was already like that!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Emeer:
I was last to the scene, and it caught me eye right away!
</line>
<center>That golden arm, pointing up at the ceiling with such optimism and authority! I thought, it looks like it's showing me the way to a better, brighter, richer tomorrow!</center>
<line>To me, it was a work of art! A precious one, at that!
</line><line>Judge:
And then it found its way into your pocket and you pawned it?
</line><line>Barnham:
You mounted it on a crude stand, gave it a tawdry title and passed it off as some kind of a sculpture...

<hr />
<line>Judge:
Where were we now...ah, yes. The victim's arm has now been successfully reattached by one of our masterful craftsmen. Knights of the Court! You may resume the inquisition.
</line><line>Phoenix:
At least one thing's clear now... As everyone can see, the victim definitely wasn't holding a knife!
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! It seems I may have been mistaken after all. When you think about it, the victim had already been turned to gold when we entered the room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to the witnesses' testimonies, that was the case, yes.
</line><line>Ms Primstone:
Well then, I'm sure you'll concede that it was easy to mistake that glittering pointing finger for a knife.
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed, the victim's finger has a glint to it resembling that of a sword's edge.
</line><line>Judge:
Such a sense of power and intensity... It's enough to send a shiver down the spine of anyone being pointed at.
</line><line>Luke:
No puzzle is a match for the power of the professor's pointing finger!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess no one remembers I'm known for pointing like that too...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
I think your pointing finger makes quite an impression too, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's just taking pity on me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Is that all you had to say, Sir Blue Knight?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
As I said before, whether the victim had a knife or not... is completely irrelevant.
</line><line>Emeer:
Y-yeah, what he said! You'd better apologise to me now! Badgerin' me for no reason like that...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Is that all there is to it? Or could that arm hold some other <span style="color:#E16935">clues</textEffects>...?)</span>
</line><line>Espella:
We've come this far... Maybe there's something else you could ask about.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She's right. I need to ask some more questions.)</textEffects> Well then, Mr Emeer. Perhaps you could tell me one more thing about that arm.
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
You found the arm on the floor, <textEffects>pointing upwards</textEffects>, you said?
</line><line>Emeer:
Yeah, I did! Finders keepers, I say! It was pointing straight up at the ceiling.
</line><line>Barnham:
The arm somehow happened to fall down in such a way that it <textEffects>landed upright</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What are the odds of that? Actually, that reminds me of a puzzle...)</textEffects> Now, if you could just show us on this floor plan here... I'd like to know the exact spot where you found the victim's arm.
</line><line>Emeer:
Sure, I remember that well. It was...right there.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph, yes. That's where you would expect it to have fallen.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(Now, if that's where it was... then something's definitely not right.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
If you keep looking at that sketch so intensely, you shall burn a hole in it. Or perhaps... you're going to claim there's a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> in it somewhere?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This arm is the final <span style="color:#E16935">clue</textEffects> left by the professor... Even after turning to gold, he was <textEffects>pointing out</textEffects> something important... Namely, the <textEffects>key</textEffects> to solving this case!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, defender? Do you see any problems in the locations as marked on the sketch?
</line>


<line>Judge:
In that case, why don't you enlighten us and <textEffects>show us</textEffects> this so-called contradiction? What contradiction does the victim's <textEffects>arm</textEffects> create?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The contradiction is right here!
</line><line>Judge:
And this is...the <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's go over the order of events, as per the witnesses' testimonies. First, the witch cast a spell on the professor, turning him to gold. When all of you rushed to the crime scene, that golden statue fell down, making a loud noise. Next, the witch dropped the sceptre.
</line><line>Barnham:
What are you getting at, Sir Blue Knight? All witnesses agree with this order of events.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. They all agree that's how it happened... But then there's the arm.
</line><line>Barnham:
Well, what about it? Spit it out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's assume that Maya was the witch... Now, look at the sketch again. The witch dropped the sceptre after having turned the professor into gold. The sceptre tumbled along the floor... and was found here, as asserted by the prosecution. However, that would be impossible. There's no way it could have been there!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... I see it now!
</line><line>Barnham:
Ngh... The...<textEffects>arm</textEffects>...it was...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm glad you seem to have noticed. The victim's arm was on the floor right here, standing on its end. Therefore, the sceptre couldn't possibly have fallen that way. Ergo, it <textEffects>couldn't</textEffects> have been the defendant who dropped the sceptre! In other words, Maya is not a witch!
</line><line>Barnham:
Nghhhhh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Orderrr! How can this be...? The inquisition's reasoning has been proven invalid through just one single piece of unusual evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Call it Layton's magical touch! The professor sacrificed his arm to leave us just the evidence needed to turn this thing around!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
That was amazing, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Luke:

An admirable deduction, Sir Blue Knight. ...That I cannot deny. Even if we are to assume your reasoning is correct and that girl in the cage is not a witch...
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Even if"...?
</line><line>Barnham:
in <i>[sic]</i> the many trials I have attended, I have become well-versed in certain aspects of magic. I am all too aware of its potential to confuse people, befuddle their minds and make their memories hazy... No one can resist such a maddening influence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you trying to say, Inquisitor?
</line><line>Barnham:
The sceptre could not have tumbled across the floor if the arm were in its way. ...However! Can we be sure that is where the arm was? Are all of the witnesses able to confirm its location at the time?
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Barnham:
And yet, no one actually saw the sceptre being dropped. Witnesses. Think back to that incident once more. Did the golden statue fall over first...or did the staff fall before it?

<line>Phoenix:
Whoa, wait a minute! What you all said just now... is totally different from your previous testimonies!
</line><line>Barnham:
...Sir Blue Knight. You are starting to notice it now, aren't you? That is the way of magic. Such is the effect this black art tends to have upon those who witness it. The witnesses are not lying, but simply having trouble remembering the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What a convenient excuse... Confronted with magic, their brains turn to mush, huh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ever since our ancestors drank from the fountains of wisdom and obtained the capacity for reason... witchcraft has been the one thing to remain incomprehensible, even to the most intelligent of us.
</line><line>Barnham:
Nevertheless, the onus is on us to stand up against magic and pass judgement on these witches! And so, here we are, doing battle with the weapons of the wise: <textEffects>words</textEffects>. With words, we shall pass judgement upon this supposed witch.

............ Well... I've been thinking about what Mr Barnham said a while ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
What was that, exactly?
</line><line>Luke:
That humans who witness magic become confused and lose sight of what's real... and they end up not knowing what actually happened... Well, I was thinking Mr Barnham might be right. And then...it occurred to me that there might be a way... I mean, we do have with us...

<textEffects>(Should I...? I'm stuck now anyway, and the witnesses' testimonies are all over the place... A new testimony would be a wild card, but it might be just the thing to <span style="color:#E16935">turn this trial on its head</textEffects>! But it's a crazy idea, all right...

Defender, are you still with us? This is not the time nor place for daydreaming. What do you intend to do?

Heh...it looks as though you've exhausted all means for a counter-attack, Sir Knight in Blue. Is it not time you drop your sword?

</line><line>Luke:
It's precisely because Cracker doesn't talk in his own words that he's certain to tell us the truth!
</line><line>Barnham:
What?
</line><line>Luke:
Cracker remembers every sound he hears, even just the once, with absolute perfection. So let's have him <textEffects>testify</textEffects> exactly what he heard!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And if Cracker can <textEffects>repeat</textEffects> every sound... I'd say this should be a valuable testimony!
</line><line>Barnham:
I cannot believe this is happening...

A witness that cannot talk will not lie, either. This idea is much to my liking. Well then. May our new witness, Cracker, testify to the court! We wish to know exactly what you heard from the beginning of the incident!

What's this now...?
</line><line>Luke:
Why, those are the sounds of the incident... exactly as Cracker <textEffects>heard</textEffects> them!
</line><line>Barnham:
Ludicrous! Evidently, this is nothing but a farce after all!
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, Inquisitor Barnham? I must admit I found the parrot's testimony quite impressive.
</line><line>Barnham:
Even if that bird can accurately recall the sounds... it is clearly useless when it comes to... the <textEffects>order</textEffects> of events!
</line><line>Judge:
You mean there's a problem with the order?
</line><line>Barnham:
First, the witch used magic to turn the victim into gold. Then, the witnesses arrived. It is reasonable to assume they cried out in terror when they did so. And yet, this testimony does not accurately convey such an order of events!
</line>
<center>It starts with a sudden scream. Followed by the door abruptly opening... and then a witness crying out. Next, we hear the victim, having turned into gold, falling down. So far, so reasonable... But the real issue is as follows.</center>
<line>The parrot seems to think the witch cast her spell after the witnesses entered. Such a suggestion is inconceivable! The reason is simple. At that time, the victim had <textEffects>already been</textEffects> turned into gold!
</line><line>Luke:
Ah...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph... Indeed, it is as you say, Inquisitor Barnham.
</line><line>Barnham:
The parrot's capacity for imitation is excellent. I will concede that its testimony does have some entertainment value. However! This animal's testimony cannot be allowed to stand as proof in this honourable court of law!
</line><line>Luke:
Don't write Cracker off just like that!
</line><line>Barnham:
Do you now see how foolish you were to summon this parrot as a witness?

<textEffects>(Ughhh...not good, Phoenix. Not good at all... Should I really go through with this cross-examination when it feels like everyone in this court is against me?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defence wishes to cross-examine the witness!
</line><line>Barnham:
What? Are you serious?! Did you not hear what I said? Are you choosing to ignore MY words?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A witness that cannot talk cannot lie, either. This parrot's testimony is the naked truth. He's simply <textEffects>repeating</textEffects> the sounds as he heard them.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's humans who make assumptions about the meaning of those sounds and arbitrarily decide whether the testimony's good or not. But, as Knights of the Court, shouldn't we be striving to uncover the truth to which this parrot holds the key?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ The truth, you say...? Very well! Show us the "truth" that this bird purportedly knows! Interrogate that parrot! Meanwhile, I shall enjoy the show.

</line><line>Barnham:
The victim was found already in his golden state. That is proof enough that the <textEffects>Goldor</textEffects> spell was used!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you're forgetting that Cracker heard this incantation <textEffects>after</textEffects> that spell had already taken place! Which makes it entirely possible that this "<textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>" spell was used as well! In other words, <textEffects>another spell</textEffects>, besides the gold transmutation magic, must also have been used!
</line><line>Barnham:
Nnngh...!
</line><line>Judge:
A-another spell...that we haven't yet considered?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, the next question that needs to be asked is: just what is this <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects> spell?
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Utter foolishness! This is absurd! As convenient as it would be for you, there is no way that a spell by the name of "<textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>" exists!
</line><line>Espella:
Oh! Mr Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What is it?
</line><line>Espella:
I've found it. The page about the spell... Godoor. It's listed in the Grand Grimoire...right here!
</line><line>Judge:
It...
</line><line>Barnham:
exists? <i>[sic]</i>
</line><line>Judge:
Wha-whaaaaaaat? Order! Order! I demand order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Just like I thought. Cracker remembered it exactly.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
But then...what kind of magic is this "<textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Espella:
Well, Milord...the Grand Grimoire describes it in the following way... Godoor: "Creates a <textEffects>portal</textEffects> on two sides of green-coloured walls. The portal will disappear after five minutes".
</line><line>Judge:
Creates a portal?
</line><line>Barnham:
On green-coloured walls?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A portal spell...
</line><line>The spell Godoor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</line><line>Barnham:
Aren't you a lucky man... It appears even the Grand Grimoire is on your side. However, there is a fatal <textEffects>flaw</textEffects> in your explanation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Judge:
What...what flaw is that, Inquisitor?
</line><line>Barnham:
It is really quite simple. Think back to how the alchemist's study looked at the time of the incident. Do you remember any <textEffects>green walls</textEffects>? Because I do not. There were none. All the walls were coated with white plaster. In other words... It was <textEffects>impossible</textEffects> to use Godoor in that room!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph... I, too, have visited that alchemist's study since the incident. I remember very well that all the walls in that room were a dull shade of <textEffects>white</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Your little theory was interesting, Sir Knight in Blue. But it has proven to be nothing more than that - a mere wild guess. As long as you cannot <textEffects>prove</textEffects> that this Godoor spell was used, your little theory shall be considered no further.
</line><line>Judge:
In all honesty, I was very surprised to learn of such a spell's existence. However... as long as it was impossible to have used this spell at the crime scene, your deduction leads us nowhere. So let me ask you now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honour?
</line><line>Judge:
Do you, perchance, have any proof that you could show us? Can you prove that it was feasible for the witch to have used Godoor in that room?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is no coincidence! That spell must have been used at the crime scene! But do I have the proof that it was even <span style="color:#E16935">possible</textEffects> to use Godoor...?)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The defence wishes to present evidence!
</line><line>Barnham:
Im...impossible...
</line><line>Judge:
The determination in your eyes made me think you would. Now then, we shall allow the defence to present its evidence to the court! Present the proof that the spell <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects> was used at the scene of the crime!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The walls in the study are coated with white plaster... Not all of them, though. There is just one spot which is green.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh? There is?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I noticed it when investigating the crime scene. You may recall that there was a small painting behind the desk. And for some reason, the wall behind it was painted green.
</line><line>Barnham:
It...it was what?!
</line><line>Judge:
I recall seeing that painting myself, too. If we look at this floor plan... I'd say it was around here.
</line><line>Espella:
Mr Wright, I'll mark it on the floor plan!
</line><line>Floor Plan updated in the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's been bothering me since I saw it. But now it's clear what it was. At the time of the incident, a <textEffects>portal</textEffects> opened up behind that painting! In other words, that was the wall utilised for the spell <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
You're certainly persistent. You just want a <textEffects>portal</textEffects> to be there so much, don't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The wall behind the painting was green, and that's a fact!
</line><line>Barnham:
Incidentally, I remember that painting well. It was a small landscape piece. About the size of, say, an open Grand Grimoire.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, it was about that size, indeed. A small, adorable picture.
</line><line>Barnham:
Even if a portal had opened in that small patch of green... no person would be able to pass through it. In fact, they'd just about be able to put their arm through, at the most. So will you please explain how a witch could possibly have <textEffects>escaped</textEffects> through a portal this small?
</line><line>Espella:
He's right, Mr Wright! No one could've got through a portal that small!
</line><line>Barnham:
Have you anything to say? Or are you so crushed by the realisation of your mistake that words fail you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ The portal was too small for a person... It doesn't require much thinking to figure that out.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But that aside, a very obvious question remains. If it wasn't a human, then <textEffects>what</textEffects> could've passed through that portal?
</line><line>Barnham:
You have put an interesting spin on things. Why don't you <textEffects>answer your own question</textEffects>? You talk as if you know everything, so please, enlighten us!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A <span style="color:#E16935">small portal</textEffects> was opened in the wall at the crime scene... And I have all the <textEffects>clues</textEffects> as to what that could mean!)</span> What went through the portal was...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
No human could have passed through a portal that small. Even a witch couldn't have pulled that off.
</line><line>Barnham:
Heh, so are you finally forsaking your mistaken assumptions?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I haven't finished, Inquisitor. The fact remains that <textEffects>something else</textEffects> could have passed through that portal.
</line><line>Barnham:
Oh? And just what would that be, Sir Blue Knight?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The portal was created after the professor had been turned into gold... The witch had a good reason behind that. She must have had to <span style="color:#E16935">move something through</textEffects> that portal.)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
You have captured my curiosity. I'd like to know what passed through the portal! Tell us, what did the witch use that magic portal for?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Considering the state of the crime scene... there is just one possible answer. And that is...the Talea Magica!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
What...what's this now?! The Talea Magica was found at the crime scene! A portal has nothing to do with it!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, you're making the <textEffects>wrong assumption</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wrong assumption?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witch wasn't trying to remove evidence from the crime scene... She wanted to <textEffects>plant it</textEffects>. She threw the witch's sceptre into the room through that portal!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
You...you and your crazy theories! Do you even realise what you're saying? If she threw the staff <textEffects>into</textEffects> the room, that means...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. She did it to <textEffects>deceive us</textEffects>. Her goal was to make us draw the wrong conclusions. When the incident took place, the witch herself wasn't in the room. She cast the spell from <textEffects>outside</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Whaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order, I say!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's not all. There's even more proof that the staff was thrown into the room from the outside.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wha...what proof?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That proof is none other than...Professor Layton's <textEffects>previously severed right arm</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
The victim's arm? How does that prove anything?
</line><line>Phoenix:
None of the witnesses have testified they saw the witch's sceptre. However... a few of them claim to have <textEffects>heard</textEffects> it rattling across the floor.
</line><line>Barnham:
That's right.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at this floor plan... Since the arm was standing upright here, we know the defendant couldn't have been the one to have dropped the sceptre. Now, think about it...where would you need to drop the <textEffects>sceptre</textEffects> from in order for it to end up here?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...oh!
</line><line>Barnham:
Ngh...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right... The sceptre could only have come from the <textEffects>small portal</textEffects> created by the spell Godoor!
</line><line>Judge:
This is most unexpected. The witch wasn't in the room when the crime occurred... Or, at least, that's the defence's claim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's the only thing that explains all the contradictions we've run into.
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, with that imagination of yours you could aspire to write fantasy stories. A nice try, I must admit. However...this line of assertion is futile! There is a glaring contradiction in your words!
</line><line>Judge:
Another "contradiction"? Whatever are you referring to, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
This is the Talea Magica that was used in this incident. As we have established, there are two magic gems in it. One for the gold transmutation spell, Goldor, and one for the shadow familiar spell, Famalia. A witch in possession of this staff would not have been able to cast Godoor!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Yes...you're absolutely right. But you can't write off all the evidence supporting my theory as mere coincidence.
</line><line>Barnham:
Why must your agreement always be followed by a "but"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What I'm getting at is... this Talea Magica...is <textEffects>not genuine</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
<textEffects>Not genuine</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. And naturally, the one responsible for this <textEffects>deception</textEffects> is the real culprit of the crime!
</line><line>Judge:
Enough of the suspense! It's too much for a man of my age... The defence shall reveal what is meant by this so-called <textEffects>deception</textEffects>!
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
First, I want to clarify one thing. Can we be certain that the Talea Magica in question is authentic?
</line><line>Barnham:
Without doubt. The metal rod in its centre is called the Spina Magica. The Witch's Mark on its tip is clearly visible and highly detailed. It is impossible to forge, even by the finest craftsmen in all Labyrinthia. I can guarantee you its authenticity.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That leaves us with only one possibility. The forgery in question is... the <textEffects>Famalia</textEffects> magic gem!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what?!
</line><line>Judge:
A...forged magic gem?!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
That...is an insult to our investigators!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Only witches can use the power of these magic gems, can't they? So tell me, how can you know whether a magic gem is the real thing or not?
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Hold it there! We know for certain that the spell Goldor was used! It is undoubtedly not forged!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But what about <textEffects>Famalia</textEffects>? Did anyone actually see a familiar at the crime scene?
</line><line>Barnham:
...! Tha...that's...
</line><line>Judge:
Three months ago, when an investigation was carried out into Sir Belduke's death... the results yielded the following conclusion: the spell Famalia had been used to summon a familiar, which in turn carried out the murder.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...And the witch used exactly that to her advantage. Another similar incident at the same crime scene...don't you think that would be the perfect opportunity... for the witch to frame the defendant for her crimes? The defendant would be blamed for both the professor and Sir Belduke's deaths... and she'd be taken for the real <textEffects>witch</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That was the real culprit's <textEffects>objective</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Judge:
............
</line>
<center>............</center>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...There is a chapter in the Magic Archive, an old collection of tales of the occult... about the way to test whether or not a magic gem is genuine.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
How can we test it, Milord?
</line><line>Judge:
It is very simple. A genuine magic gem is composed of a mineral with a density lower than that of pure water. All you need to do is see if the magic gem floats on water.
</line><line>Barnham:
That is simple indeed...
</line><line>Judge:
All non-magical minerals in our world, with the exception of sepiolite and a few other special kinds, sink in water. These eerily sparkling magic gems, however, will never sink when put into water. Bailiff! Remove this magic gem for immediate examination!
</line>
<center>...The magic gem's a fake?...What's up with this trial! <i>[sic]</i> This is not how it was supposed to be!It's all right, darling, don't cry! You'll get to see a witch burning today... Sir Barnham never disappoints! Hush, now. There, there!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</center>
<line>
Judge:
Defender... If your theory is correct, this could be the biggest occult crime in history. But another important question remains. I wonder if you can answer it... Who is this supposed real witch that threw the Talea Magica through the portal?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">real witch</textEffects>... There's only one person that comes to mind. Frankly, I still find it hard to believe...but it's the only possibility... Once I indict her, there'll be no turning back... Knowing the consequences, should I... should I give them her name?)</span>
</line><line>Espella:
............ Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Espella:
In Labyrinthia, witches are punished by fire. I know you think that's going too far... But even in a world that seems so insane to you... those who take the lives of others must be punished. That's a universal law...isn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The witch turned the professor into a golden statue. And that's not all... She took the life of the alchemist too. And now she's trying to pin the whole thing on Maya... I...I can't just let her get away with that!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, then... Defence, let us hear your theory. Who is this witch responsible for using Godoor and then throwing the sceptre through the resulting portal?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however <span style="color:#E16935">improbable</textEffects>, must be true. There's only one <textEffects>logical</textEffects> possibility. It has to be that person!)</span> The real witch is...Jean Greyerl!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? Greyerl? I've heard that name somewhere... Wait, isn't that the butler who served Sir Belduke?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's correct.
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
Psh! What's this about?! You seem to love rolling out these ridiculous suggestions, but you ignore the obvious... Jean Greyerl is <textEffects>male</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, tell me one thing... Is it only <textEffects>females</textEffects> who can be witches?
</line><line>Barnham:
Are you daft?! Of course it's only females!
</line><line>Judge:
Never in the history of this court, has there ever been a male witch.
</line><line>Barnham:
You're so utterly ignorant! You should be ashamed of yourself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...All right, well. I'd like to ask another question. Is Jean Greyerl...really a <textEffects>male</textEffects>?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm?
</line><line>Barnham:
What... What a ludicrous question...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The defence is certain... that Jean Greyerl is the <textEffects>witch</textEffects> responsible for using magic on Professor Layton!
</line><line>Barnham:

Will you stop fooling around?! This is... a groundless accusation!

</line><line>Phoenix:
"Groundless", you say? I'm afraid that's where you're wrong.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
At the time of the crime, Jean Greyerl was in the room next to the alchemist's study. And one of the walls in that very room... was <textEffects>painted green</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
It...it was?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's more, that green wall... was the one adjacent to Sir Belduke's study!
</line><line>Barnham:
What...?! This is madness!
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham! Quickly, have the butler summoned to the court! Have Jean Greyerl brought here immediately!
</line><line>Barnham:
Certainly, Milord. It shall be done.
</line><line>???:
</line>
<center>There is no need for that.</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
I am here. I shall come down right away.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, it's you!
</line><line>Greyerl:
Well then, Mr Wright. Shall we begin?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Jean Greyerl.
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem this trial has turned in a new direction. I think we all need a bit of time to take it in. We shall take a brief intermission. Inquisition, defence...sharpen your swords and wits to prepare yourselves for the next stage of this battle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour!
</line><line>Barnham:
It shall be done, Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
By the time we resume, the examination into the magic gem should have ended as well. Now, the court is adjourned for a brief intermission!
</line>
<center>To Be Continued...</center>

<line><i>Waiting Hall</i>
</line><line>Maya:
So...it's got to be that, uhm...young butler?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I know what you're thinking. I couldn't quite believe it at first, either. But... The evidence and circumstances all point to the butler. He...or she, has to be the witch. At least... it'll be certain if the magic gem turns out to be a fake.
</line><line>Maya:
............ But if that's the case...then Belduke's murderer was also...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. It would be Greyerl.
</line><line>Espella:
No, it can't be true! He wouldn't have done that!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
I know Jean. He held Sir Belduke in the greatest of respect. Jean didn't kill him! I'm sure of it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Jean Greyerl...are you really what people think you are? There are still so many unknown factors in this trial...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
Ah!
</line><line>Luke:
............
</line><line>Maya:
It's Luke!
</line><line>Luke:
I... ............ I'm sorry, Maya! What I did is unforgivable!
</line><line>Maya:
............ What are you saying, Luke? All you did was testify about what you saw.
</line><line>Luke:
But...but...I...should've trusted you!
</line><line>Maya:
Well, you trust us now, right?
</line><line>Luke:
Maya...
</line><line>Espella:
Anyway, Luke, it was thanks to you that we discovered new information.
</line><line>Luke:
Thanks to me?
</line><line>Maya:
Sure! You got Cracker to testify. That was a great idea! I wish I could talk to animals! Don't you too, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
Oh, yes. I'd love to have a chat with Eve!
</line><line>Maya:
So, Luke...will you teach us how to do it? Pretty please!
</line><line>Luke:
Uhm, yeah, of course! I can try.
</line><line>Maya:
Yay! That's a promise, right?
</line><line>Luke:
...... Uhm, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm? What is it, Luke?
</line><line>Luke:
Do you mind if I join you from now on?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not at all, Luke.
</line><line>Luke:
I realised during the trial... that in this strange town, even what you see with your own eyes may not be real. That's why...I'm not giving up yet! Professor...I know he'll return! We can't give up hope!
</line><line>Maya:
You know, that's what I've been thinking too.
</line><line>Luke:
Really?
</line><line>Maya:
I have a feeling he'll reappear again when we get into trouble and help us out. Because, I mean...it's the professor we're talking about here!
</line><line>Luke:
Right!
</line><line>Maya:
And remember what he always says: Look forward to the future! Always look <textEffects>on the bright side</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Err...I don't think it was the professor who said that...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Defender! Accused! The intermission's over. Return to the courtroom!
</line><line>Maya:
...!
</line><line>Espella:
...!
</line><line>Luke:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's go. It's time to bring this trial to a close.
</line><line>Luke:
Oh... I have something for you, Mr Wright! Here, please take it. Maybe it'll <textEffects>come in handy</textEffects> in the trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A letter, huh? Let's see who it's from... Wait... "<textEffects>Newton Belduke</textEffects>"? <textEffects>(There are several sheets of parchment inside, but they're all <span style="color:#E16935">blank</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Luke:
The professor and I got this when we went to see the Storyteller!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Luke! The more info we have the better.
</line><line>Luke:
You're welcome!
</line><line>Blank Letter added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got no proof that it was Jean Greyerl who turned the professor into gold... Even if the magic gem is a fake, it's still not decisive evidence. I don't know what will happen next... But I do know this battle's far from over.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line><i>Witches' Court</i>
</line><line>Judge:
We will now resume the trial of Maya Fey. First things first, the Occult Crime Analysts have finished examining the evidence... They have tested <textEffects>the two magic gems</textEffects> from the witch's sceptre.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
"Goldor floated on the surface of the water, whereas Famalia sank."
</line><line>Espella:
It was said that genuine magic gems <textEffects>float in pure water</textEffects>, wasn't it?
</line><line>Judge:
Thus, it has been established... that the Famalia magic gem is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>! Order! Order! Order in court! This does not prove that <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects> was used, of course. Nonetheless... The defence's theory does now seem more plausible. The court considers it worth looking into. ...You have no objection to that, do you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ No, Milord.
</line><line>Talea Magica updated in the Court Record.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, bring in the witness!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Barnham:
Witness, state your name and profession.
</line><line>Greyerl:
My name is Jean Greyerl. I served the late Master Belduke... Since his death, I have been tending to his dwelling and putting his research materials in order.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...? <textEffects>(Hmm, I don't know what it is, but... I feel like there's something a bit <span style="color:#E16935">different</textEffects> about Greyerl today.)</span>
</line><line>Greyerl:
</line>
<center>............</center>
<line>
Judge:
Witness... There is something we need to clarify first of all. As you are no doubt aware, you have been accused of being a <textEffects>witch</textEffects>...
</line><line>Barnham:
Therefore, it is vital that you tell us... Are you a boy or a girl?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Please hold on.
</line><line>Judge:
Why...what is it?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Excuse my rudeness, Milord, but at this time... I do not intend to answer that question.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Why do you refuse to answer, witness?
</line><line>Greyerl:
I had been following this trial from the gallery and so am fully aware of the utterly absurd accusations made against me. Alchemy, the art pursued by Master Belduke, is concerned with the rules and logic that govern nature. As someone who had been helping Master Belduke for quite some time, I dare say your theory is both illogical and impossible.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witch's sceptre was thrown into the crime scene through a portal, created by the magical spell Godoor. That portal could only have been opened from your room. And what's more...one of the walls in your room is painted green!
</line><line>Greyerl:
I believe anyone is free to paint their walls in whichever colour they please. Besides... your theory relies on one magic gem being a fake. While that may have been proven true, another question has arisen... where could the <textEffects>genuine</textEffects> magic gem be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! It...it must have been swapped with the fake one and discarded somewhere...
</line><line>Greyerl:
I'm afraid that's <textEffects>impossible</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why?
</line><line>Greyerl:
If we assume, as you have claimed, that the witch used the spell Godoor... that would mean the magic gem must have been swapped <textEffects>after</textEffects> creating the portal. So tell me, <textEffects>when</textEffects> and <textEffects>where</textEffects> would the witch have disposed of the magic gem?
</line><line>Barnham:
I see your point. Several people paid witness to the incident, and the Knights of the Inquisition arrived at the scene immediately after. During that time, no one left the building and the whole place was meticulously searched.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Naturally, my room was searched as well. Although there was not much to see, as I have few personal belongings.
</line><line>Barnham:
Despite our inspection, nothing resembling a magic gem was found. I assure you, we have not overlooked anything. I would swear to it on my honour as a knight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
So, Mr Wright. If you wish to accuse me of being a witch... should you not first prove that there is a connection between <textEffects>me</textEffects> and this missing magic gem? Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could please approach the matter in a <textEffects>rational</textEffects> way, like an alchemist.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The house was searched very soon after the crime... If the gem wasn't found, then it means Greyerl <span style="color:#E16935">hid</textEffects> it somewhere. Somewhere the Knights of the Inquisition would <textEffects>not have looked</textEffects>. Where could it be?)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
The witness has made a valid argument. How will the defence respond?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ The knights who searched Sir Belduke's premises weren't looking for a magic gem. That's why...there is a certain place they <textEffects>didn't consider searching</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Interesting. You really don't give up easily, do you? In that case, perhaps you could tell us all where the magic gem is!
</line>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Phoenix:
Sir Belduke's premises were thoroughly searched... I don't think anything would have been missed there. You anticipated that...and that's why you hid it in a <textEffects>blind spot</textEffects> that you knew wouldn't occur to the knights!
</line><line>Barnham:
A <textEffects>blind spot</textEffects>, you say...? Well, where is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's...somewhere <textEffects>on Jean Greyerl's person</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what?! It's <textEffects>on the witness</textEffects>?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
Don't tell me...the witness has it in their pocket. You're just guessing, aren't you? You think you can just say anything you like...
</line><line>Greyerl:
By the way, I'm afraid there are no pockets in my clothing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is the <span style="color:#E16935">second time</textEffects> I've seen Greyerl today... and both times, I've had a feeling that something wasn't quite right. Maybe it's just me...but it could be related to the <textEffects>whereabouts</textEffects> of the magic gem...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Defence, <textEffects>show us</textEffects> the location of the magic gem. Where do you think this witness hid the magic gem on the day of the crime?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Witness... We met for the first time at Sir Belduke's premises. At that time, you had an <textEffects>amethyst</textEffects> attached to your collar.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, that's right. Mr Greyerl always wears that gemstone.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Alchemists believe that amethysts emit positive energy.
</line><line>Barnham:
Amethysts...are purple...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But when I saw you in the waiting room this morning... The gemstone you were wearing was <textEffects>green</textEffects>, not purple.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
So my question now is...where has it gone? Where is that amethyst... that you supposedly "always" wear?
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Wait...wait just a minute! The witness wears a <textEffects>purple</textEffects> gemstone?
</line><line>Judge:
Is something amiss, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ When we arrived at the crime scene, the witness came out to meet us... I recall the witness wearing a gemstone... but that gemstone was <textEffects>green</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Green? Amethysts aren't green. Although amateurs sometimes mistake prasiolite for amethyst. But that's irrelevant now...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Witness. You've been trying to pin the blame on the defendant. In order to do that, you <textEffects>replaced</textEffects> the Godoor magic gem with a regular gemstone.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Judge:
We thought the witch who killed Sir Belduke had used the spell Famalia. You knew that if a witch's sceptre with the Famalia and Goldor magic gems attached was discovered at the crime scene... the suspect would be accused of committing both crimes. And that's precisely what happened. The girl captured at the crime scene was accused of slaying both Sir Belduke and Sir Layton.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That was your plan. You removed the <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects> magic stone from the sceptre and inserted your amethyst in its place. And then...you attached the Godoor gem to your collar!
</line><line>Barnham:
That's why, when we saw you shortly after the incident, you were wearing a <textEffects>green</textEffects> gemstone. To think...that was in fact a <textEffects>magic gem</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! ...Witness, is that true?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ This amounts to nothing more than conjecture. I do not believe you have any solid proof. However... I have to concede that you have surmised a logical connection between me and the missing magic gem. Consequently...I am prepared to answer your questions.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Good. I will repeat what I asked you previously. Witness. State your name, profession and finally, your gender.
</line><line>Greyerl:
...My name is Jean Greyerl. I have been serving the late Master Belduke. As you can see, I wear a butler's outfit... but the truth is as the defence claims. I am...a <textEffects>girl</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
A <textEffects>girl</textEffects>... Unbelievable...
</line><line>Judge:
What?! The butler is a girl?! O-order! Order! Order in the court! Jean Greyerl... Are you declaring to this court that you are, in fact, female?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes.
</line><line>Judge:
B-but...everyone in town was under the impression that you are a boy...
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line>
<center>Eh, did you hear that? The butler's a girl! Doesn't that make him...er, her a maid?I knew there was something suspicious about him... I mean, her!You know why, right? Think about it. All that alchemy...that's mighty suspicious.</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
...Just listen to them. Listen to the wild gossip and accusations. Alchemists pursue knowledge of the rules that govern nature. But to the townspeople...alchemy is no different to magic. Had they known I was a girl, they would have taken me for a <textEffects>witch</textEffects>. That's what Master Belduke was worried about. He told me it would be safer to pretend to be a boy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In other words... you disclose that you're a female, but deny that you're a witch?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ I would have thought that was obvious.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She knew that once her gender came into question, she wouldn't have been able to conceal it. That's why she made this public now. It was the most <span style="color:#E16935">rational</textEffects> choice for her...)</span>
</line><line>Greyerl:
Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you one question? Has all the evidence in this "Golden Gentleman" case already been presented?
</line><line>Barnham:
Why do you ask?
</line><line>Greyerl:
As it stands, you do not have a single piece of evidence proving that I am a witch. Given the lack of pertinent evidence against me, I would like to be permitted to return to my duties.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph... What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ It has been proven that the two gems were swapped. However, it may also have been possible for the accused to have done so.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya had no <textEffects>reason</textEffects> to swap the gems!
</line><line>Barnham:
This is a place of judgement. There is no need for us to understand the reasons behind a criminal's actions.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
After all, those whom we judge are other-worldly creatures...they are witches. It is impossible for a human being to understand the reasoning of a witch.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Espella:
Is there nothing we can do? At this rate, Maya will be...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Barnham still thinks Maya is a witch! We've made it this far...and yet, it feels like we're back at stage one.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Greyerl:
It seems there are no more rational arguments against me. Now, if you will kindly excuse me...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I don't have much on Greyerl when it comes to the professor's case... But should I just let her go?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Your testimony is not over yet. There's still something you need to tell us about.
</line><line>Greyerl:
...Mr Wright. I'm afraid I cannot help you. I have told you all I could about this incident.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And I'm afraid you've got the wrong idea, Ms Greyerl.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honour. What this witness needs to testify about is <textEffects>not</textEffects> the professor's unfortunate incident... but rather, the incident from three months ago. Namely, Sir Belduke's death. As she was present in the building at the time, working as a live-in butler, she needs to testify about the events of that day!
</line><line>Judge:
About Sir Belduke's death?!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The fact that one of the magic gems was swapped leads me to a single conclusion. Both crimes, the murder of Sir Belduke and the transmutation of the professor, were the work of <span style="color:#E16935">the same witch</textEffects>. The truth behind the alchemist's death may also hold the <textEffects>answer</textEffects> to this case!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph... What is your opinion on this, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ I'll allow you to have your way this time, Sir Blue Knight. The inquisition has no objections.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham... It seems you have lost that unyielding attitude so admired by the townspeople. Here you are now, letting a novice defender lead you by the nose... It is hard to believe you have been known as the "Unwavering Sword of Justice", for your usually cool-headed judgement...
</line><line>Barnham:
You know little about me, witness. Do you think I care about defending my name? It is this town that I wish to defend.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
Sir Belduke's murder is the only case to have remained unsolved for so long. Jean Greyerl, you shall now testify about it!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
As demanded by both the defence and inquisition... the witness will testify about Sir Belduke's death. Any questions?
</line><line>Barnham:
No, Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
I must, however, mention one more thing before we begin. If it cannot be proven that Jean Greyerl is a witch, as claimed by the defence... the court will irrevocably consider Maya Fey to be the witch responsible for both crimes. Is that understood?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
You have no choice, Sir Blue Knight. If you don't want the trial to end right now, ready your sword and face the challenge that awaits.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But...the opponent is a real witch! It's a gamble that puts Maya's life at stake!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
</line>
<center>...Nick... ...Nick!</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(M-Maya!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
No witch is gonna outwit you in court. You're an ace attorney, after all! So...let's do it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ The defence accepts the conditions. Let's proceed with the trial.
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmph...
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
</line><line>Barnham:
We shall start with a brief summary of the incident. About three months ago, in the dead of night, Sir Belduke, the alchemist, was murdered. The crime took place in his study, just as with this incident. The room had been locked from the inside. The victim was found still seated in the chair at his desk, so we can assume he was attacked while working. There were very clear strangulation marks visible on his neck.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... There's something trickling down from his mouth. Is that <textEffects>blood</textEffects>?
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes, most likely. The victim probably bit his tongue as he was struggling with his assailant.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And you said earlier that some <textEffects>white powder</textEffects> was spilled all over the floor, correct?
</line><line>Barnham:
Yes. Hence, we expected to find the killer's <textEffects>footprints</textEffects>. However, <textEffects>there were none</textEffects>. The killer must have somehow approached the victim without stepping on the floor. After murdering Sir Belduke, the killer left the room without opening the door.
</line><line>Judge:
Undoubtedly, the crime must have been committed with the use of <textEffects>witchcraft</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
The body was discovered the following morning by the butler...Ms Greyerl.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The body was found by <span style="color:#E16935">Greyerl</textEffects>, huh...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Thank you, Inquisitor Barnham. The Court Illustrator's sketches will be added to the evidence.
</line><line>Crime Scene Sketches added to the Court Record.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, witness. Begin your testimony. Tell us about the events spanning the night of the crime, from the evening beforehand until you discovered the body.

<line>Greyerl:
At around 1 o'clock at night, I excused myself and left Master Belduke in his study.
When I called him for breakfast in the morning, he did not respond. The door to his study was locked.
A neighbour had come for a visit just then, so we forced the door open together.
All the potions and other concoctions from the study have been confiscated. I wonder if they're being properly stored...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
"Potions and concoctions" were confiscated?
</line><line>Barnham:
The victim was an alchemist, after all. We were hoping the items confiscated from his study could provide some clues. Besides, such things must not fall into the wrong hands. It may not be standard practice, but it was deemed necessary. The confiscated goods are stored in our secret vault. The only person with access to them is the High Inquisitor, Lady Darklaw.
</line><line>Greyerl:
It has caused me great difficulty, as I have not been able to put Master's research materials in order as a result.
</line><line>Barnham:
The confiscated items shall be returned as soon as Sir Belduke's murder is resolved.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ I shall be looking forward to that.

<line>Phoenix:
There's something you don't seem to understand here, Mr Emeer. The <textEffects>Famalia</textEffects> gem in this witch's sceptre is a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>. The gem is <textEffects>useless</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
Just like this buffoon's testimony.
</line><line>Emeer:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, your testimony doesn't <textEffects>hold water</textEffects>.

</line><line>Barnham:
You should have listened to the trial more carefully!
</line><line>Judge:
Now that has been dealt with... Inquisitor Barnham. This witch's sceptre was not discovered at the crime scene when Sir Belduke was murdered, is that correct?
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed. We deduced that Famalia must have been used, however.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
But, that Famalia magic gem was a <textEffects>fake</textEffects>. That much has been demonstrated today! What's more, as we've learned from Cracker the parrot's testimony... the witch used the spell <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects>! The fact that there's a green wall at the crime scene corroborates that!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
That wall may well not have been painted green three months ago! And besides...no one could have passed through a portal so small!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph... To be honest, I've started wondering. Were Sir Layton's and Sir Belduke's murders... actually committed by the same witch?
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honour, I'd like to remind you that was the inquisition's claim!
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(He's right, though... It's got to be the same culprit in both cases!)</textEffects> And...at the very least... it's <textEffects>possible</textEffects> that the witch used the spell Godoor to commit Sir Belduke's murder.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what!
</line><line>Judge:
In that case, I will ask the defence to show us proof. Do you have proof that the witch could have used Godoor to kill Sir Belduke?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
I'd like you to take a look at these.
</line><line>Judge:
Aren't those... the Court Illustrator's sketches?
</line><line>Phoenix:
As you can see from this sketch, the victim was seated at his desk when he was murdered. And <textEffects>what</textEffects> can you see right behind the victim?
</line><line>Barnham:
...A small landscape painting...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you, Inquisitor. But there's one more point of note... Look closely at the painting. Do you notice...anything behind it?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...oh! I see it! The wall behind it had already been painted green! Which means the witch <textEffects>could have</textEffects> used the portal spell there three months ago!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
One moment, Milord! Consider how small that portal would've been! Could a witch have passed through it? I think not!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course, the witch would not be able to go right through it. However... if you look at the distance between the portal and the victim, you'll notice... that the victim, Sir Belduke, was sitting just an arm's length from where the portal would have been!
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The witch did not have to enter the room at all! All she had to do was reach through with her arms in order to strangle Sir Belduke, who was sitting right under the painting!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Inquisitor Barnham, what say you to that?
</line><line>Barnham:
A fascinating theory, Sir Blue Knight. But there is a notable <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> within it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Where would that be?
</line><line>Barnham:
Tell me, why do you think we concluded that Famalia had to have been used? We had a certain reason for it, of course.
</line><line>Judge:
And...what was that reason, exactly?
</line><line>Barnham:
The crime scene had been <textEffects>tampered with</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
How so?
</line><line>Barnham:
Imagine the circumstances of Sir Belduke's death, and it should become obvious, even to you. The victim was choked to death. And yet there were no signs of a struggle. <textEffects>Highly improbable</textEffects>, don't you think?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What are you getting at?
</line><line>Barnham:
Think about it. Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be <textEffects>evidence of a struggle</textEffects>! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer <textEffects>erased</textEffects> all <textEffects>traces of a fight</textEffects> from the crime scene.
</line><line>Judge:
I-indeed! That would be the logical conclusion!
</line><line>Barnham:
Now, surely it would be impossible to do any such thing, had the witch only reached inside through a portal. In order to cover up the evidence she left behind, the witch had to have used a <textEffects>familiar</textEffects>. Without doing so, there would have been no point in her using the spell Godoor!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl could have done it... She might have been able to tamper with the crime scene.
</line><line>Barnham:
What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The morning of the crime... from the time Ms Greyerl and that guy entered the study... until the arrival of the Knights of the Inquisition... There was a <textEffects>window of time</textEffects> in which she had the opportunity to do so. We need to look into <textEffects>what happened in that window</textEffects>!

In any case, Miss Mailer did visit us that night. She came to deliver a package to Master Belduke. She delivered it to Master personally. There were always many things to which I was not privy.
</line><line>Mailer:
Right. And I saw you that night. When I was leaving. I almost walked into you.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes, it's just as you say. I was about to wish Master Belduke a good night.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Greyerl looks a lot more confident now... But she seemed so <span style="color:#E16935">shaken</textEffects> for a moment earlier. I wonder what that was about... Maybe I <textEffects>missed</textEffects> the right moment.)</span>

</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, I have to ask you again... Why have you kept this information from the court until now?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ Please accept my sincere apologies. It was such an obvious part of my daily routine that it didn't even occur to me to mention it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You want us to believe that you simply forgot to tell us?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
That would match the evidence found at the crime scene. I do remember seeing an uncorked bottle of tomato juice there.
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Wright! Please take a look at this! It's here in the Court Illustrator's sketch too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So it is. That Court Illustrator certainly does pay attention to the details...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Barnham:
Then, that would mean... the red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth is not, in fact, <textEffects>blood</textEffects>. It is <textEffects>tomato juice</textEffects>. I think we can safely make that assumption.

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mister, I believe the reason you might have lost consciousness at the crime scene... is tied to a certain <textEffects>piece of evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Emeer:
But wasn't it just because, y'know, I had a bit too much fun the night before?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No. It was because of...this!
</line><line>Barnham:
The tomato juice?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You passed out right after drinking this juice. Therefore, it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a <textEffects>direct connection</textEffects> between the two.
</line><line>Barnham:
Tomato juice does not make people fall unconscious, Sir Blue Knight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. That's why <textEffects>something</textEffects> must have been added to the contents of that bottle! Something like...a <textEffects>soporific</textEffects>!
</line><line>Greyerl:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Y-you mean, sleep medicine?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And if a soporific was mixed in with the tomato juice... that means Sir Belduke would have been <textEffects>unconscious</textEffects> at the time he was assailed!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! Oooooooh! Th-this sketch! Have another look. The red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth... is proof that Sir Belduke must have drank the <textEffects>tomato juice</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
I...I had failed to consider this...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, I bet you remember saying this to the court: "Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be evidence of a struggle! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer erased all traces of a fight from the crime scene." However! If the victim was unconscious when his assailant was strangling him... then the killer could have committed the crime through a <textEffects>small portal</textEffects>, big enough to put their arms through, after all!
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
That may be so, but tell me this: how would the culprit have managed to obtain such a strong soporific? ...Arghhh...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was very simple. And I think you've realised why.
</line><line>Barnham:
From the <textEffects>alchemist</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. An alchemist would no doubt have a wide array of various medicaments in their possession. And an apprentice would have little trouble stealing some of them from their study. Isn't that right...Ms Greyerl?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ How should I respond to that... "I'm sorry to disappoint you" may perhaps be the best way to put it.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what do you mean...?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Even though that juice bottle has been safely stored for the past three months... I'm positive it would be impossible to find any traces of that soporific now.
</line><line>Phoenix:

The <textEffects>name of the recipient</textEffects>. There were only a few people who knew the intended recipient of that letter. Four people, to be precise.
</line><line>Judge:
Only...four people?
</line><line>Phoenix:
First was Sir Belduke, the author of the letter. Then there was Ms Mailer, who delivered it. And of course the Storyteller, its recipient. As well as...one more person. The one who stole the letter, using a portal spell, and swapped it with the blank sheets of parchment...the <textEffects>witch</textEffects>.

</line><line>Phoenix:
No. She didn't.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
When Ms Mailer came with the delivery, Sir Belduke was still writing that letter. In fact, he was <textEffects>in the middle of it</textEffects>. At that time, the letter had not been addressed yet. And the next morning, when the body was discovered, that letter was already in the letterbox. Keep in mind that Ms Greyerl would have had no opportunity to see it then, either.
</line><line>Barnham:
Is that...so...? She went to report the crime without even setting foot in the study...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And then, Ms Mailer appeared and retrieved the letter. Needless to say, Ms Greyerl couldn't have learned of the letter's recipient afterwards.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Or maybe you have a good explanation, Ms Greyerl? I'd very much like to hear one. Can you please tell the court how you found out the <textEffects>recipient's name</textEffects>?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ Mr Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uhm, yes?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Do you remember what I said when I was called to the witness stand?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes...
</line><line>Greyerl:
At the heart of alchemy lies the pursuit of the rules and logic that govern nature. You have demonstrated the power of your own logic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl...
</line><line>Judge:
Are...are you saying...
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes. I confess. The abhorrent witch who used the spell Godoor to swap the contents of that letter... and who took the life of Master Belduke... It was none other than I.
</line>
<hr />
<center>I was an only child, born to a poor family. I've been a witch since I was very little... When did I become aware of it? I don't remember. Although I was but a young child, I knew that being a witch was a crime. That's why I hid my witch's sceptre and wouldn't use magic at all. My father worked as a bricklayer. He toiled every day, but we could hardly make ends meet. One winter day...we couldn't afford to pay the rent. We were going to lose the house. My mother was in tears, and my father was sitting with his head down, wordless."I want money for Mummy and Daddy!"</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
That day, I suddenly remembered about <i>[sic]</i> the <textEffects>witch's sceptre</textEffects> that I had hidden.
</line><line>Barnham:
The Goldor spell...
</line><line>Greyerl:
I thought I'd try it, just once...casting the spell. But at the time, I had no idea what an irreversible mistake that would be.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
Even though no one told me... I knew from the very beginning what magic I was able to use.
</line>
<center>What should I turn into gold? I was thinking about it really hard, the little girl that I was. Something that wouldn't stand out, that could be taken for a work of art. Then I decided. I chose a pretty leaf that had fallen into our garden."Goldor!"</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
But...it wasn't the right thing to do after all. ...I was terribly <textEffects>punished</textEffects> for using magic, even just the once.
</line><line>Judge:
Punished?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...In what way were you punished?
</line><line>Greyerl:
I placed the leaf down in the back garden and cast the spell. But then... Margaret suddenly walked in front of me.
</line><line>Barnham:
Margaret?
</line><line>Greyerl:
My...closest childhood friend. Margaret... Right before my eyes, she... She was turned into gold!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, dear me!
</line><line>Greyerl:
I screamed and cried but...I knew I couldn't ask anyone for help. If anyone had seen it, they would have known it was the work of magic. And I knew...Margaret wasn't coming back.
</line><line>Espella:
That...that's terrible...
</line><line>Greyerl:
Then, my mother and father's faces flashed before my eyes.
</line>
<center>We may have been very poor, but we were always happy together. Had I been captured as a witch, I feared my parents probably wouldn't be safe either. That thought tormented me more than anything. And so, I made the decision... I decided to end my own life. I threw myself into the river near the town. It was winter and the water was as cold as ice. I couldn't even move. It was painful. My consciousness started drifting away... ............ The next thing I knew...I was in Master Belduke's residence. He risked his own life jumping into the freezing river to save me. I burst into tears and told him everything. I didn't want to go back home. I would only end up causing my parents grief. Master Belduke listened to me without interrupting. And then, he told me this: "You can stay here. But from now on... you must live as a boy."</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
Master Belduke met with my parents and explained everything to them. They were very sad...but they agreed it would be best if I didn't return home.
</line><line>Espella:
Poor Miss Greyerl... That must have been so awful for her...
</line><line>Greyerl:
Master bought the house for my parents, so they wouldn't have to worry about paying rent any more. As for Margaret, turned into gold...he brought her to his residence. He knew that if anyone saw her, they would report an incident of witchcraft.
</line><line>Judge:
And this Miss <textEffects>Margaret</textEffects>, is she...still in that golden state?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes...she is.
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmm, that's strange. We have received no reports of anyone by that name having gone missing.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Margaret is...being kept in the basement under Master's study.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The...basement? Correct me if I'm wrong, but this <textEffects>Margaret</textEffects>... Is she a...
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes. My dear friend...was a <textEffects>goat</textEffects> that we were keeping at our house.
</line><line>Judge:
A...
</line><line>Barnham:
...Goat.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Until then, Master Belduke had mainly been researching medicine... but since the incident with Margaret, he became known as an alchemist.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So that's when he became an alchemist... I was wondering why the goat was the only thing not covered in dust...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Greyerl:
That's how I started a new life as Master Belduke's butler.
</line><line>Judge:
Sir Belduke would sometimes work as a physician, curing the townspeople of their illnesses. As his assistant, you have also shown commitment to helping the townspeople through your work.
</line><line>Greyerl:
I forgot about being a witch and was able to live happily, at peace with everyone... I thought it could stay like that forever... ............
</line><line>Barnham:
...But those peaceful days came to an abrupt end. Tell us...what in the world was the cause?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ Even I am not quite sure what led to this. However... it all started three months ago, with that <textEffects>lightning strike</textEffects>.
</line>
<center>Master Belduke and I were on our way back home, carrying specimens for experiments. An old bell tower appeared in the flames... Everyone who saw it was stupefied.</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
But the expression on Master Belduke's face was <textEffects>unlike anything I'd seen</textEffects> before.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Greyerl:
His face went pale and twisted in <textEffects>sheer terror</textEffects>. He was shaking violently...
</line>
<center>It wasn't just astonishment at an unusual phenomenon. It seemed as if he was afraid of <textEffects>something more concrete</textEffects>.</center>
<line>
Barnham:
Perhaps Sir Belduke saw something that others couldn't.
</line><line>Greyerl:
He cancelled his experiments for that night and began writing a letter to someone.
</line><line>Judge:
A letter...
</line><line>Greyerl:
I found out about it when I brought him his bottle of tomato juice.
</line>
<center>He was writing feverishly, as if he were possessed. I... I saw some things. A few <textEffects>words</textEffects> in that letter... "...expose everything..." "...cannot keep this secret any longer..." "...the truth about the witch..." ......... Master Belduke... was going to confess... that I was a <textEffects>witch</textEffects>.</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
Everything went black in front of my eyes. I will never forget the feeling... that overwhelmed me at that moment.
</line><line>Judge:
Is that when you decided to commit the crime?
</line><line>Greyerl:
What I did first was "accidentally" singe a part of the wall in my room. It was an excuse to repaint that section of the wall...green.
</line><line>Barnham:
Then you also painted the wall behind that painting in Sir Belduke's study.
</line><line>Greyerl:
And when that fateful night came...
</line>
<center>I used a syringe to inject a soporific through the cork and into the bottle of tomato juice. So many thoughts were running through my head as I wished Master a good night. I opened the portal behind him... He was right there, in front of me, asleep. I reached for the letter in the letterbox, taking care not to wake him. And then I happened to notice the name on the envelope...</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
</line>
<center>"Storyteller".</center>
<line>When I read that name, the world all around me turned black once more. It's impossible to avoid what is written by the Storyteller... It seemed as if I could hear the doors to all escape routes shutting closed. It was the sound of despair.
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Greyerl:
I would like you to believe me... that the thought of taking Master Belduke's life never once occurred to me. I only planned to steal that letter and then disappear. But...
</line>
<center>As I looked upon Master, sleeping there in front of me... at that moment, I felt an evil presence awaken within me. Why did he save my life? And...why did he betray me? Before I realised what I was doing... my hands were clutching his neck. He...didn't move at all. So I...I...kept on clenching his neck. ............ That's it... That's the truth about what happened three months ago.</center>
<line>
Barnham:
There is just one thing I fail to understand.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes?
</line><line>Barnham:
You said you wanted to run away once you had stolen the letter. Yet despite that, you continued to live in Sir Belduke's residence. And now, here you stand. Why did you not run away?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ My life had been thrown into disarray due to the absurdity of magic. I had learned all about alchemy, living at Master's residence. Alchemy is concerned with the logic that governs the world. I...wanted to believe that there truly was such a thing. So I stayed in that place hoping to one day see the irrational nature of magic overcome by the power of reason.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Magic being overcome by reason...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Greyerl:
That night... I swapped the letter with blank sheets of parchment and waited for the sun to rise. I resolved to wait for the day when my true identity could be exposed through reason and logic. Master's death remained a mystery for three months. And people started to lose interest. And then you appeared, Mr Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
On the day you visited the residence... I was listening to your conversation from the other room. "Has the time finally come for me?" My heart was racing with anticipation. Then... a few minutes after everyone entered that room, an unbelievable incident took place.
</line><line>Judge:
That incident...
</line><line>Greyerl:
A witch appeared...in Master's study.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what?!
</line><line>Greyerl:
I wanted to get a look at the witch, so I created a portal in the wall behind the painting. Precisely at that moment...
</line>
<hr />
<center>"Goldor!"</center>
<hr />
<center>The witch used one of the very spells that I can use, too. When I heard those words, a single thought flashed through my mind. This was my chance. I could dispose of my witch's sceptre!</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
I knew at the time what kind of a witch the Inquisition would be looking for.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A witch that can use <textEffects>Famalia</textEffects> and <textEffects>Goldor</textEffects>.
</line><line>Greyerl:
It occurred to me that I only needed to change one of the magic gems. I had previously found out that the <textEffects>Famalia</textEffects> gem was <textEffects>purple</textEffects>. I realised that if I swapped the <textEffects>Godoor</textEffects> magic gem for my <textEffects>amethyst</textEffects>... I could pin the blame for my crime on that other witch.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you changed one of the gems and threw the witch's sceptre into that room, is that correct?
</line><line>Greyerl:
...Exactly.
</line><line>Barnham:

</line><line>Barnham:
Wait a minute, Jean Greyerl! This statement of yours... is highly problematic!
</line><line>Phoenix:
How so, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes...you are right.
</line><line>Judge:
Can someone explain to me what this is about?
</line><line>Greyerl:
I am a witch, indeed. A sinful creature that killed the person to whom she owed her life. However... regarding the gentleman standing next to you, Mr Wright... He may have fallen victim to a witch... But that witch was not me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah...
</line><line>Judge:
Ohhh... Wait, whaaaaat?! Order! Order! Order in the court! What...in the... What is the meaning of this?!
</line><line>Barnham:
Jean Greyerl admits killing Sir Belduke, but not to turning Sir Layton into gold. That is the gist of it, Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
B-but lying about it is meaningless!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>Lying</textEffects>?
</line><line>Espella:
Just <textEffects>being a witch</textEffects> is a crime in <textEffects>itself</textEffects>. And the punishment for that crime is the same, regardless of whether she took one person's life or two. That's why there's no point in lying about it. I'm sure that's what the judge is thinking.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Greyerl is still claiming she never laid a finger on the professor... But if there's no point in lying...does that mean she must be telling us the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Luke:
So in that case, who's responsible for what happened to the professor? If it wasn't her, then who was it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line>
<center>............</center>
<line>
???:
</line>
<center>...Uhm.</center>
<line>
Emeer:
Mind if I say somethin'?
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Take a hint, witness. Does it feel like this is the right moment for you to talk?
</line><line>Emeer:
Yeah, well. That's kinda why I was stayin' quiet until now. But... I either say it now or never. ............
</line><line>Judge:
Don't simply fall silent after saying that! It only makes it weigh on my mind more! Whatever did you want to say?
</line><line>Emeer:
............ Oi, Bluey.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-yes?
</line><line>Emeer
I need to make sure about somethin'. Me head's not what it used to be, y'know.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ugh... Yes...?
</line><line>Emeer:
The alchemist's butler...uhm, lady butler. She slipped <textEffects>sleep medicine</textEffects> into his drink?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's correct. She laced his tomato juice with it.
</line><line>Emeer:
And then he...uhm, she strangled the alchemist afterwards?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Sir Belduke was unconscious from the sleep medicine, so he didn't resist.
</line><line>Barnham:
And that explains why we found no signs of a struggle at the crime scene.
</line><line>Emeer:
Yeah... About that... I let it slip earlier about what I did at the crime scene, right? I told you that...uhm...I had a few sips of that <textEffects>juice</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
...And the sleep medicine mixed in made you <textEffects>sleep like a log</textEffects>. Yes, we remember.
</line><line>Emeer:
Yeah, well... Here's the thing... This is just between us, okay? Y'see, when I appropriated that juice... the juice bottle was, well...still unopened.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was unopened?
</line><line>Emeer:
Har har har. Me throat was parched, and I wasn't thinking straight. That brand new bottle was just there, waitin' for me, with a corkscrew conveniently laid next to it. I couldn't just let that go to waste. I swiftly pulled out the cork and got to drinkin'.
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what...?
</line><line>Emeer:
So, in case you don't get what I'm gettin' at, the alchemist... <textEffects>didn't have a single drop</textEffects> of the juice with the sleep medicine!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</line><line>Judge:
W-witness! You... You... ...went to the trouble of opening a bottle found at a crime scene just to drink its suspicious contents?!
</line><line>Emeer:
That's what I've been tellin' ya, I was dyin' of thirst!
</line><line>Judge:
That doesn't justify what you've done!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
The Inquisition shall deal with this witness after the trial. He will find out what it means to be dying of thirst in a more literal meaning. However, let us not waste any more time with him now. The witch has confessed to her crimes. There is no need to investigate Sir Belduke's death any further.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph. Indeed, you are right, Inquisitor. Her role in the Sir Layton incident is not entirely clear... but a person who kills her protector, to whom she owes her very life, can be nothing other than a witch. The court has sufficient grounds to sentence her as such.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Belduke didn't drink the juice that night... And if that's true, there's one thing here that doesn't add up.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Wright! I have to say, there's something about this that's bothering me. I'm sure there's a <textEffects>contradiction</textEffects> lurking in that man's testimony.
</line><line>Espella:
You think so, Luke?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Can I really turn a blind eye to that?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Mister, you're saying you opened the tomato juice bottle... But that claim <textEffects>contradicts</textEffects> a certain piece of <textEffects>evidence</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what?!
</line><line>Judge:
............ Defence, I'd like a word with you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour?
</line><line>Judge:
At this point. your client's innocence has already been established. Therefore, whether there is a contradiction in that man's testimony or not should no longer be any of your concern.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That may be so, Your Honour. But, even though I'm here to defend the accused... the true duty of any attorney is to uncover the truth behind what happened.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My job's not done until there are no more contradictions left!
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Very well. Sir Blue Knight, let us hear about this contradiction you have discovered.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The bottle was first opened by that guy, meaning Belduke didn't drink any of it... That means there's one piece of evidence that should be very difficult to explain!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I would like to hear about this contradiction, too. The defence shall present evidence. Where is the contradiction in this witness having been the one who opened the tomato juice bottle?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The contradiction can be seen in one of the <textEffects>sketches of the crime scene</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
In one of the sketches?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at Sir Belduke's <textEffects>mouth</textEffects>. We can see a line of <textEffects>red</textEffects> liquid <textEffects>trickling down</textEffects> from his mouth.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well. We have already established that it was the tomato jui- Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honour. Sir Belduke <textEffects>didn't drink</textEffects> any of the tomato juice that night...
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Which means, there's only one other possibility. That red line is, as we thought first of all, <textEffects>blood</textEffects>. Sir Belduke must have tried to fight back the assailant and bit his tongue in doing so.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Unfortunately, that would only bring us back to the <textEffects>problem</textEffects> we encountered earlier.
</line><line>Barnham:
"Earlier"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the victim had put up a fight... then there should have been traces of a struggle at the crime scene. And yet, no such traces were found. That's what made you assume the witch must have used Famalia.
</line><line>Barnham:
Ngh...! Y-yes, that is so...
</line><line>Greyerl:
As I explained before... Master Belduke didn't struggle at all at the time. But when I think about it now, in light of the new information, it was very <textEffects>unnatural</textEffects>...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The victim didn't drink the soporific, yet <span style="color:#E16935">didn't struggle</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
But...what in the... What does this mean? If it's not <textEffects>tomato juice</textEffects>, nor <textEffects>blood</textEffects> brought about through a struggle with the murderer... then what else could it be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ Since it's not tomato juice, we have to assume it's <textEffects>blood</textEffects>, after all.
</line><line>Emeer:
Yeah, right? It's gotta be that!
</line><line>Barnham:
We have ruled out the possibility that the victim bit his tongue while struggling with the attacker.
</line><line>Greyerl:
Indeed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Then there's got to be <span style="color:#E16935">a different reason</textEffects> for that blood being there... He must have suffered <textEffects>internal bleeding</textEffects> that was somehow connected to his <textEffects>death</textEffects>... But what could have <textEffects>caused</textEffects> it?)</span> ...Your Honour. If I may ask one question...
</line><line>Judge:
A question? To whom?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I just clarify this <span style="color:#E16935">one suspicion</textEffects>, I may be able to explain the blood shown in the sketch. That's why I need to <textEffects>question</textEffects> one person in particular...)</span>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Mister, can I ask you something?
</line><line>Emeer:
Y-yeah? Don't give me that scary look, Bluey! I...I know nothin'! Nothin' at all. I've got nothin' to tell!
</line><line>Birdly:
</line>
<center>♪Emeer's as innocent as a little lamb. But is his confidence more than a sham?♪</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
............ <textEffects>(He'd be better off without that bard.)</textEffects> You drank the tomato juice that was at the crime scene, right?
</line><line>Emeer:
D-d-don't keep askin' me about that over and over again! S-so what if I did?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then...I have another question for you. Did <textEffects>anything else</textEffects> disappear from the crime scene that day?
</line><line>Emeer:
............ ............ ............ Nah...I didn't notice anythin'.
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Witness! Just what have you done this time? You look like a dog caught making a mess on the carpet!
</line><line>Emeer:
Wh-wh-wh-wh-why're you l-l-l-lookin' at me like that?! I dunno about anythin' goin' missin'! I'm innocent! Please believe me!
</line><line>Birdly:
</line>
<center>♪Truth could drown in his swimming eyes. Some tell lies well, others cannot tell lies♪</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like my gut feeling was right. He <span style="color:#E16935">took something</textEffects> from the crime scene... Something that could be directly connected to that red liquid around Belduke's mouth.)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
What on earth did that man steal from the crime scene?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A certain item disappeared from the crime scene that day... And, at this very moment...it's highly likely that item is <textEffects>right in front of our very eyes</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
What...? It's here?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Isn't that right, mister?
</line><line>Emeer:
Is...is it? I, uhm, I have no idea!
</line><line>Judge:
Defender! I order you to <textEffects>show us</textEffects> what this item is. The <textEffects>item</textEffects> that this witness took from the crime scene!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
It's this <textEffects>bottle</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
The bottle?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, I'd like you to clarify something for me.
</line><line>Greyerl:
What would that be, Mr Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sir Belduke was working on creating certain medicines... He had various <textEffects>dangerous substances</textEffects> in his possession, as well. How were they stored?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Master kept them in a locked medicine cabinet. The bottles were labelled so that it was clear that they were dangerous. They have all been confiscated.
</line><line>Phoenix:
As for those <textEffects>labels</textEffects>... Did they resemble... the label on that guy's bottle?
</line><line>Greyerl:
...! Mister... What are you doing with a product of Master's research?
</line><line>Emeer:
It's not what you think! I didn't have any evil intentions, or nothin'!
</line><line>Greyerl:
That bottle belonged to Master. And it was used... to store <textEffects>strong poison</textEffects>. Poison strong enough to kill...
</line><line>Judge:
P-poison...?
</line><line>Barnham:
Wh-what?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The red liquid trickling down Sir Belduke's mouth was definitely blood. Now, as for what caused him to bleed like that from his mouth... it was the <textEffects>deadly poison</textEffects> from the bottle this guy stole from the crime scene!
</line><line>Barnham:
This is...outrageous!
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat! Order! Order! Orderrrrr!
</line><line>Emeer:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! D'ya expect me to just keep quiet?! It was poison?! Poison! Am I...gonna die?!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
Just wait and see. Time will tell.
</line><line>Emeer:
Y-yeah, I guess.
</line><line>Barnham:
More importantly, I want to know why you have that bottle!
</line><line>Emeer:
Huh? Uhm. Well, that's... Uhh. Remember how I told you I drank the alchemist's tomato juice?
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed. It's not something easy to forget... Especially having heard it several times.
</line><line>Emeer:
Well...that was when I saw it on the floor. This bottle right here. It was totally empty. And I thought, y'know, it's such a fancy-lookin' bottle and all. I'm a bit of a skull-fancier. They have this air of danger about them, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
They certainly do.
</line><line>Emeer:
So, since it was there, and I was there too, I felt we were kinda meant for each other. I thought, "This bottle's so classy I could die for it!"
</line><line>Greyerl:
Had any poison been left in the bottle, you would have died instantly. But if it was empty, it was probably harmless.
</line><line>Emeer:
Ooooh! Hear that? I'm gonna live! Good thing I rinsed it well before use! *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
</line><line>Judge:
But if the victim was killed by poison... that raises a new question, of course.
</line><line>Barnham:
<textEffects>Who</textEffects> could have poisoned him...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Considering all the evidence and the testimonies we've heard today, the answer is so close, I can taste it.)</textEffects> Sir Belduke was poisoned by...
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It was, of course, Sir Belduke himself.
</line><line>Judge:
Sir...Belduke himself?!
</line><line>Greyerl:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sir Belduke took that poison of his own will. His death was <textEffects>suicide</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Barnham:
That is preposterous! A <textEffects>suicide</textEffects>? Inconceivable!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Think about it, Inquisitor! That would explain the most <textEffects>unnatural aspect</textEffects> of his death.
</line><line>Judge:
The most <textEffects>unnatural aspect</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, when you were strangling Sir Belduke... he put up <textEffects>no fight</textEffects> whatsoever, is that correct?
</line><line>Greyerl:
Yes, it is. Until today, I was convinced it was due to the sleep medicine...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It wasn't. Because he didn't take any. The truth is, when you gripped his throat, Sir Belduke... was already dead. He had <textEffects>poisoned himself</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
Nghhhh!
</line><line>Judge:
B-but would the poison have caused him to bleed from his mouth?
</line><line>Barnham:
I personally know of no poison that works instantly and causes such symptoms.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... Y-you don't? <textEffects>(I can't just tell them that it happens on TV all the time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Greyerl:
There are certain plants in this area that contain a highly poisonous substance. In the course of his research, Master Belduke found a way to extract that poison.
</line><line>Judge:
What am I hearing?! Is there really such a dangerous plant in Labyrinthia?
</line><line>Greyerl:
The poison is very bitter to taste, so it would be impossible to secretly slip it into someone's food or drink... And it would cause internal damage. It is a very powerful poison... Drinking it would induce a most painful death.
</line><line>Barnham:
And to think Sir Belduke could...
</line><line>Judge:
But... did Sir Belduke really choose such an agonising death for himself? It doesn't seem like he suffered that much.
</line><line>Greyerl:
...I would like to know that too.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl...
</line><line>Greyerl:
You mean to say Master killed himself after exposing me as a witch? I...I cannot believe it! He...he just wouldn't commit suicide!
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed, we cannot take such a theory at face value! Had he committed suicide, I dare say he would have left a suicide note!
</line><line>Phoenix:
............ I can't say why Sir Belduke committed suicide, but... I think there's a piece of evidence that can confirm his suicide was a <textEffects>possibility</textEffects>.
</line><line>Barnham:
There...is a piece of evidence like that?!
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Judge:
If you have such evidence, you ought to present it to the court immediately. Present the evidence indicating that Sir Belduke's death could have been suicide!
</line>


<line>Judge:
That's...Sir Belduke's letter. Let's see...it was addressed to the Storyteller, wasn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is the last letter written by Sir Belduke. Now, if his death was a suicide... then this letter may well be his <textEffects>suicide note</textEffects>!

</line><line>Barnham:
What we have here is nothing more than blank sheets of parchment. Whether or not there was a suicide note is something we can only speculate about.
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. But there is one person who knows whether this letter was really a suicide note.
</line><line>Barnham:
You mean...the person who <textEffects>swapped</textEffects> its contents... In other words... You...Jean Greyerl.
</line><line>Judge:
Witness, you stole Sir Belduke's letter on the night of the crime. Tell us, what was written in it?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ I don't know.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what? You don't know?
</line><line>Greyerl:
I did steal the letter, yes. But...I don't know what its contents were.
</line><line>Barnham:
You mean you have <textEffects>not read it</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Greyerl:
I couldn't bring myself to read it. It seemed that if I did... everything that had happened since Master Belduke saved my life would be ruined in an instant. I've taken it out and held it in my hands many times... But no matter what, I just couldn't...
</line><line>Espella:
Miss Greyerl...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Can you tell us where that letter is now?
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ I have it here.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... You're...carrying it around with you?! If you were searched, you would've been done for!
</line><line>Greyerl:
That night...having killed Master Belduke, I decided to stay in his residence. I knew my identity would be revealed sooner or later, and I was ready for it.
</line><line>Barnham:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
So, until that time... I decided to always keep the letter with me. ...Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, witness?
</line><line>Greyerl:
If you don't mind, could you please read it aloud?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Greyerl:
Now that I'm here, in this place of judgement... I think I'm finally ready to hear what Master wrote.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmph...
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl. I think you should be the one to read it.
</line><line>Greyerl:
...Me?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sir Belduke wrote this letter to the Storyteller as he was preparing to die. I think it's only right his last words should be read by you.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............ Yes, you're right...I see. I understand. Please allow me to read the letter aloud.
</line>
<hr />
<center>My dear friend... I hope you will be able to forgive me for leaving this world of my own will. I have finally made this decision, having seen that accursed bell tower appear in the flames on that dreadful night. That lightning was a sign that we have angered the gods. What I have done cannot be forgiven. I can never escape from it. For the past few days, I have been thinking that it might be best to simply expose everything. This town's secret... The truth about the witch... Of course, I understand that <textEffects>secrets</textEffects> need to be kept. However, I have grown very tired. I'm afraid I cannot keep the secret any longer. I have only two concerns. The first is my daughter. It pains me to be leaving her alone in this world... Although, she probably doesn't think of me as her father.</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A <span style="color:#E16935">daughter</textEffects>...?)</span>
</line><line>Barnham:
Hmm? I was not aware that Sir Belduke had a daughter.
</line><line>Luke:
Mr Belduke seemed to know a lot about this town... This town's "secret"... And the "truth" about the witch...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Truth about the witch... Somehow I don't think he was talking about Ms Greyerl.
</line><line>Greyerl:
</line>
<center>............ The second matter weighing heavily on my mind... is that Jean will be left on her own. Ah!</center>
<line>
</line>
<center>Seeing her growing up so strong and righteous, in defiance of her fate, had given me hope. A short while ago, she brought me my usual, and what will be my last, drink. There are so many things I wanted to tell her, but I could only manage a "thank you". She is a very sharp child. Had I said any more, she would have caught on. You could call me a selfish man... But I didn't wish my last memory of her to be a sad one.</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
Master... Master Belduke...
</line><line>Phoenix:
............
</line>
<center>If the fate handed to her by this town has made her life an ordeal until now... I hope from the bottom of my heart that a wonderful story awaits her next. I intend to leave my residence to her. And I would like you to look out for her. Alas, it is time for me to put my pen down. My dear friend... what I truly wish to express to you is too complicated for words. I hope one day you will understand. But for now, I bid you farewell. The time has come for me to go.</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line>
<center>............</center>
<line>
Greyerl:
</line>
<center>...This...this letter...</center>
<line>It wasn't a denunciation of me being a witch...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Master Belduke cared about you... until the very end.
</line><line>Greyerl:
...Yes... ...How could I have forgotten...? <i>I'm sure...I knew it all along... So why did I... How could I have done that to him?</i><textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Voice-over only">*</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Voice-over only)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
...Miss Greyerl...
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Milord.
</line><line>Judge:
What is it, Inquisitor Barnham?
</line><line>Barnham:
I think it is about time. ...For the <textEffects>guilty verdict</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
G-guilty...?
</line><line>Barnham:
The inquisition withdraws the charges against Maya Fey... and charges Jean Greyerl with being a witch.
</line><line>Greyerl:
............
</line><line>Barnham:
All the evidence corroborates this accusation, and she even admits her guilt. Hence, the inquisition asks that the witch be found guilty and <textEffects>punished</textEffects> immediately.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Not so fast, Inquisitor Barnham!
</line><line>Barnham:
What do you want now, Sir Blue Knight?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Admittedly, Ms Greyerl did attempt to strangle Sir Belduke... but he had consumed a deadly poison and was already dead at the time! Therefore, she is not guilty of <textEffects>murder</textEffects>!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Phoenix:
And one more thing! It also wasn't Ms Greyerl who turned Professor Layton into gold. There was another witch present at the crime scene. The defendant, Maya, saw her too! To put it simply... Ms Greyerl didn't kill anyone!
</line><line>Barnham:
............
</line><line>Maya:
Yeah, she didn't kill anyone! And yet... you still want to burn her?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
Do you even know how it feels to be put in this cage? It's like everyone's against you and it's super frightening! I'm not a witch... but I've been thrown into this cage and almost sentenced for something I didn't do! And now you're about to do the same to another person?! That's just not right!
</line><line>Barnham:
............ Is that all you have to say?
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Barnham:
The one who's in the wrong is not me, but you, Sir Blue Knight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Barnham:
Whether the witch committed a crime or not is completely irrelevant. This is the Witches' Court. All witches must be punished by fire!
</line><line>Maya:
But...that's crazy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Why...why, Barnham?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Espella:
............
</line><line>Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham is absolutely right. Being a witch is a crime. You understand that, don't you, Miss Greyerl?
</line><line>Greyerl:
...Yes.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well then. The court is ready to issue the final <textEffects>verdict</textEffects>. Maya Fey is found innocent! And in her place...
</line>
<center>Jean Greyerl is found guilty of being a witch and shall be cast into the fire!</center>
<line>
Maya:
Nooooo, you caaaaaan't!
</line><line>???:

</line><line>Espella:
Please, hold the verdict!
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Espella!
</line><line>Barnham:
What is it now, Espella Cantabella?
</line><line>Judge:
There is nothing else we can do. This is the course of things, and you should know it well.
</line><line>Barnham:
Indeed. "All witches shall be cast into the flames." That is the law of this town... A law that was written by your very own father. And furthermore, a law that has always been obeyed in the town of Labyrinthia.
</line><line>Espella:
A town like this...should never exist in the first place!
</line>
<center>What? Such insolence...That's heresy! She's criticising the Storyteller's Story!Even the Storyteller's daughter has no right to criticise the Story!</center>
<line>
Espella:
Trials in which innocent people are sentenced to death by fire... I shall make sure this is the last one!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean, Espella?
</line><line>Espella:
Since you're all so keen on the rules created by the Storyteller, you should know exactly what I mean. The stipulation for ending the witch trials: "Once the Great Witch Bezella is burned, the witch trials will end." At present... I am under suspicion. You know very well why that is, don't you?
</line><line>Judge:
You...you don't mean that you're...
</line><line>Espella:
I am guilty. I am the Great Witch Bezella!
</line><line>Barnham:
What?!
</line><line>Espella:
Now, cast me into the flames! And let Miss Greyerl free!
</line><line>Greyerl:
...! Miss Cantabella...
</line><line>Espella:
This shall be the last of the witch trials! No one else need be burned hereafter!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Espella, just what are you saying?! I can't let you do that!
</line><line>Espella:
Please, Mr Wright! Let me do as I wish. I'm sorry, but this is a problem concerning the people of Labyrinthia!
</line><line>Maya:
No, please don't do it!
</line><line>Luke:
There must be another way! You don't need to do this!
</line><line>Espella:
It's all right. Luke, Maya... Mr Wright...and Mr Layton. I truly appreciate all you have done for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This can't be happening!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Miss Cantabella... Your confession will have very serious... or rather, <textEffects>fatal</textEffects> consequences for you. May we assume that you fully understand those consequences and are willing to accept them?
</line><line>Espella:
</line>
<center>............ I am Espella Cantabella, the Storyteller's daughter. But I also have another name... I am the Great Witch Bezella. I have lived hidden in the dark pages of my father's Story, deceiving all of you. Many lives have been sacrificed because of me.</center>
<line>But that shall end today.
</line><line>Judge:
</line>
<center>Court attendants! Seize that woman! She is the Great Witch Bezella!</center>
