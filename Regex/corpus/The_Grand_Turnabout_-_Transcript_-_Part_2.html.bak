</line><line>Edgeworth:
John. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong?
</line><line>John:
That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!?
</line><line>Kay:
You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk?
</line><line>John:
Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know?
</line><line>John:
Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers.

<line>John:
<textEffects>They're reshooting the scene today, so...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>John:
<textEffects>Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>John:
<textEffects>I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
We have evidence right here.
</line><line>John:
Ah! Could that be...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.
</line><line>John:
........Ugh.
</line><line>Lang:
What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary.
</line><line>Lang:
Th-This is... a <textEffects>monster's footprint</textEffects>...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set?
</line><line>Courtney:
John... Why did you conceal this video from us?
</line><line>John:
........No reason, really.
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right?
</line><line>Courtney:
John Marsh! Answer him clearly!
</line><line>John:
But Mom.....
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well?
</line><line>John:
...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing.
</line><line>Lang:
........
</line><line>Kay:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice.
</line><line>John:
...Yeah. Got a problem with that!?
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
You're saying that's why you hid the evidence?
</line><line>Courtney:
John!
</line><line>John:
Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home.

</line><line>Lotta:
How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster!
</line><line>John:
...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too.
</line><line>Nicole:
He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious!
</line><line>Lotta:
Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven!
</line><line>John:
...Shut up. We're done talking!

<line>Edgeworth:
A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that?
</line><line>John:
...! I don't know anything about it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is that true?
</line><line>John:
I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after John had already gone back...)</textEffects>
</line><line>John:
If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems that John doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?)</textEffects>
</line><line><i>Leads to:</i>
"Wait up..."
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Edgeworth:
So there was nothing out of the ordinary...?
</line><line>Kay:
He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Wait up...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
? Agent Lang?
</line><line>Lang:
Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left.
</line><line>Kay:
The Moozilla costume...?
</line><line>Lang:
Try comparing it with the one over there right now.
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Zipper on its back...?)</textEffects> Wha! <textEffects>(Th-This discrepancy is...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside.
</line><line>Kay:
WHAAAAAAAT!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...?
</line><line>Powers:
It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use...
</line><line>Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In here?
</line><line>Lang:
Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, that's right! Judge Courtney! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume!
</line><line>Courtney:
I... I did no such thing!
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Courtney could not have entered this place!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
...And what if there was an accomplice?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?
</line><line>Lang:
I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Mother and Son Theory --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.
If John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.
The two of them then hid the president's body.
Inside that monster costume over there...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
You think this crime had such an elaborate plan?
</line><line>Lang:
To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think?
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
John would never... take part in such a crime!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though?
</line><line>Lang:
Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected?
</line><line>Courtney:
......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret.
</line><line>Courtney:
M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please...
</line><line>Lang:
Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out.
</line><line>John:
Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying.
</line><line>Lang:
Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's true, Judge Courtney's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Rebuttal</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Mother and Son Theory --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
<textEffects>When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>If John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>The two of them then hid the president's body.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>Inside that monster costume over there...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Kay:
Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point.
</line><line>Kay:
In that case, what should we do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case?
</line><line>Lang:
You have a problem with that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt!
</line><line>Lang:
Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm... Where have I seen this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.
</line><line>Lang:
Huh? And what of it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves.
</line><line>Lang:
Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This grey substance is...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.
</line><line>Kay:
You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to?
</line><line>Kay:
Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves.
</line><line>Kay:
Then, maybe...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes...
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! That's when John came to practice!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby.
</line><line>Lang:
Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot.
</line><line>Lang:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in John's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!)</textEffects> <textEffects>What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage.
</line><line>Lang:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection.
</line><line><textEffects>Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it!
</line><line>Lang:
Aiyaaaaaaaaa!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag!
</line><line>Officer:
Yessir!

</line><line>Lotta:
Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...And the noisy one returns.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lotta:
That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically.
</line><line>Lotta:
Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nicole:
Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nicole:
Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
If we only knew just what the "monster" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The monster's true identity...?)</textEffects> We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do.
</line><line>Lotta:
Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that "monster", I already know what it is.
</line><line>Lotta:
Wha'd ya say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. The video John recorded provided the hint that I needed...
</line><line>Lotta:
Whatchu talkin' bout?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on John's practice. At that times, she mistook "something" for Gourdy.)</textEffects> The "monster" can be seen in this photograph.
</line><line>Lotta:
What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane!
</line><line>Lotta:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The video John recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane.

But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols.
</line><line>Penny:
Y-Yes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct?
</line><line>Penny:
Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark?
</line><line>Penny:
That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out...
</line><line>Nicole:
But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, "Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile..."!
</line><line>Lotta:
Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lotta:
Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.)</textEffects> Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. <textEffects>This is the "skin" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...John still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin!
</line><line>Nicole:
Whaaaaaaaat!
</line><line>Lotta:
Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isn't that right, John?
</line><line>John:
Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, the "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion.
</line><line>Lotta:
Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again...
</line><line>Nicole:
M-Mentor!
</line><line>Kay:
Seems like things have finally settled down.
</line><line>Lotta:
I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong.
</line><line>Lang:
...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed.
</line><line>Kay:
Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out.
</line><line>Forensics:
Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy!
</line><line>Lang:
Good! Show it to me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure." So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was <textEffects>crushed to death</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I thought as much...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that <textEffects>gunpowder residue</textEffects> was found on his right hand.
</line><line>Kay:
Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, <textEffects>gunpowder residue</textEffects>. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun.
</line><line>Kay:
A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.)</textEffects> Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head!
</line><line>Lang:
I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all.
</line><line>Kay:
This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Courtney should be cleared up, right!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Courtney met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly.
</line><line>Kay:
That's a relief!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was...
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying...
</line><line>Lang:
That's right. You killed him, didn't you? John Marsh!
</line><line>John:
........
</line><line>Lang:
That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the "footprints". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face.
</line><line>John:
..............
</line><line>Lang:
He looks pretty shaken up to me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It looks like he hit the mark... but John doesn't want to talk about it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. What is your intention?
</line><line>Lang:
The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal.
</line><line>Courtney:
Agent Lang. You would suspect John enough to go that far...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As long as John's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.)</textEffects> Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Mr. Analysis</textEffects> is ready to go, sir!
</line><line>Lang:
Now we're talking!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She wants me to do it...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?)</textEffects>
</line>




<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Th-This is...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>Lang:
Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video.
</line><line>Lang:
Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent!
</line><line>Courtney:
Impossible!
</line><line>John:
Huh!? N-No way!
</line><line>Lang:
It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This video places John at a major disadvantage...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>John:
Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this!
</line><line>Lang:
That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! John Marsh! There's no doubt. You killed the president!
</line><line>Courtney:
N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? John... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president?
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...?
</line><line>Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video!
</line><line>John:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John! What are you hiding?
</line><line>Courtney:
John...! Please tell us the truth!
</line><line>John:
.......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault...
</line><line>Courtney:
John Marsh! What did you do!?
</line><line>John:
M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- During the Rehearsal --</textEffects></center>
<line>John:
While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...
After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off.
Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot.
When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over...
Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen...
And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
H-How can that be...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop.
</line><line>John:
..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself.
</line><line>Kay:
So... the president's death was John's fault?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...And then, what did you do with the fallen head?
</line><line>John:
I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>John:
I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...
</line><line>Kay:
...it would've fallen off! So, the head <textEffects>fell down because of the fire</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.
</line>

...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here?
</line><line>John:
I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there!
</line><line>Lang:
You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Courtney on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with John...?

You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you?
</line><line>John:
Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...)</textEffects> ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time.
</line><line>John:
A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

<line>Kay:
It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.
</line><line>Kay:
But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?

John. It is painfully obvious that you are desperately trying to hide something from me.
</line><line>John:
Wh-Wh-What are you going on about!? I-I'm not hiding anything!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You are hiding... ...something about this <textEffects>yellow stain</textEffects> on the president's clothes, correct?

!

Why did you leave it entirely out of your testimony? The fact you made no mention of it only serves to cast more suspicion upon yourself!

</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney?
</line><line>Courtney:
Allow me to explain.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why are you...?
</line><line>Courtney:
The yellow stain left on the president's chest... ...is almost certainly <textEffects>Lion Lily</textEffects> pollen.
</line><line>Lang:
Lion Lily...?
</line><line>Courtney:
When I met with the president on the roof of the Grand Tower two nights ago... ...I brought him a bouquet of Lion Lilies. Lion Lilies are beautiful flowers with stunning golden petals. Some of the pollen from the lilies must have gotten on the president's suit.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? But... ...I didn't see any lilies in the security footage though?
</line><line>Courtney:
They were simply obscured by the president's body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why did you bring a bouquet?
</line><line>Courtney:
Th-That..... I... I cannot say.
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
Hey, hey! You're keeping way too many secrets! You won't tell us why you met with the president OR the reason you brought him flowers!?
</line><line>Courtney:
.....My apologies. However, I did give him the bouquet. That much is true.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But when the president's body was discovered, we didn't find any flowers.
</line><line>Courtney:
I... I honestly don't know how that could be...
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! Hey, Ms. Judge! All your answers have been too vague... You "can't say" this, and you "don't know" that! Do you accept flimsy testimony like that in your trials!?
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>John:
Hey! Cut it out!
</line><line>Courtney:
J... John!
</line><line>John:
I... threw the flowers away.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You threw them away? So, there were flowers near the body when you found it?
</line><line>John:
.....Yeah, that's right. They were right on top of the president's body. They had been crushed as flat as pancakes, though...
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! I see! So the flowers were squashed by Moozilla's head too...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And a large amount of pollen got stuck to the president's suit. ...That seems to be the gist of it. However, why did you go out of your way to dispose of the flowers?
</line><line>John:
..........No reason.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So John's not going to tell us anything either...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
I guess mother and son both have a lot of secrets, huh.
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
That is not true. At the very least, I can tell you why John threw away those flowers.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!?
</line><line>Courtney:
John. You saw me leaving the house with those flowers in hand, did you not?
</line><line>John:
........
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! I get it! John saw the flowers and thought of his mom!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...He threw them away in order to protect Judge Courtney from being suspected.
</line><line>John:
Th-That's not true. You're all wrong!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...That was his worst lie yet...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Bouquet data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
I often decorate our house with those flowers. The bouquet must have reminded him of me.
</line><line>Lang:
So the pup just happens to find the flowers from his mother's bouquet on top of the body... That's why he threw them away and kept silent about the body? Hah! That's a tidy little story if I've ever heard one.
</line><line>Kay:
And what's wrong with that!? I suppose you prefer untidy, messy stories, Agent Lang?
</line><line>Lang:
Don't tell me you've forgotten already, Missy? This pup confessed that he caused the monster's head to fall last night.
</line><line>Kay:
Oooh... That's true, but...
</line><line>Lang:
He's currently the only suspect in the president's murder!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm. It is true that there are many reasons to suspect John...)</textEffects> ...However! There is someone other than John who is far more suspicious!
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
John himself was kidnapped by that very person not too long ago.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!
</line><line>Lang:
A refrigerated warehouse?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! The refrigeration wasn't turned on, so he wasn't about to freeze to death... ...but if he hadn't yelled out for help, we would've never found him.
</line><line>Kay:
Once the sleeping drugs wore off, he was finally able to call out for help.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sleeping drugs... huh. If I recall correctly, when you were kidnapped...
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! There was a bottle lying on the floor of the refrigerated warehouse... I think it was the same thing that was used one me not long ago. That <textEffects>Sleepy zZz</textEffects> stuff! It's super powerful!
</line><line><textEffects>Sleeping Drugs data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How about it, Agent Lang? John is clearly a victim. There is a <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> at work behind the scenes of this case.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
I don't know anything about this so-called "<textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>". You say they were here last night?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I... still don't know for sure yet...
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! It's not like you to be so vague, Mr. Prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...Indeed, I still don't have any evidence that ties the mastermind to this murder... Is there someone else? Is there anyone besides John who had the opportunity to murder the president...? That's it...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
...As I thought. In the end, that pup is our only suspect.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isn't there one more suspect, Agent Lang...?
</line><line>Lang:
What's this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Didn't we prove it earlier? Last night, there was one more person here!
</line><line>Lang:
.....Blaise Debeste. You're saying he's the one who did it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Last night, John was not alone. Blaise Debeste was here too. Shouldn't we consider him to be a new suspect?
</line><line>Lang:
Blaise Debeste... killed the president!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's entirely possible.
</line><line>Lang:
........ .....Blaise Debeste... It can't be...! The same guy from 12 years ago?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hm? 12 years ago? That keeps popping up...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Roland:
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
</line><line>Lang:
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! What happened 12 years ago?
</line><line>Lang:
.....Nothing that concerns you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
On the contrary. It might just have some sort of connection with this case.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
.....Hmph. And I suppose you have some proof, Mr. Prosecutor? Show me evidence that there's a connection between this case and the one 12 years ago!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Evidence... you say?
</line><line>Lang:
If you don't have any evidence, then there's no point in talking about it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Something big is happening here. Jill Crane's murder two days ago. And now, the president's murder today. There has to be some connection there. And the key to solving it lies in what happened 12 years ago, does it not?
</line><line>Lang:
......You're asking me to reopen the old wounds of the Lang clan?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. I beg of you.
</line><line>Lang:
........

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who was that just now?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Shifu!
</line><line>Lang:
Y-You guys! What are you all doing here!?
</line><line>MIB:
We followed you here, Shifu! We heard that Shifu was investigating the incident from 12 years ago...
</line><line>Lang:
You idiots...! I'm not your boss anymore. Get back to your own posts!
</line><line>MIB:
Sir......... We can't do that!
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say? Are you disobeying my order?
</line><line>MIB:
Shifu! We also beg of you! Reinvestigate... the <textEffects>SS-5 Incident</textEffects> from 12 years ago! None of us could ever forget that case! We know you feel the same way, Shifu...
</line><line>Lang:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Even your former subordinates desire to reinvestigate the case.
</line><line>Lang:
And you think you can solve the mysteries of that case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps I can... with your help.
</line><line>Lang:
Tch! ...I got it. I accept your invitation.
</line><line>MIB:
Shifu! Shifu! Shifu!
</line><line>Kay:
Now then! With that decided, I guess it's my turn to shine!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay?
</line><line>Kay:
We're investigating a case from the past, right? And guess what the best tool for that is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The <textEffects>Little Mr. Thief</textEffects>...
</line><line>Kay:
Right! If we have the case files from the past case, I can re-create it!
</line><line>Lang:
Unfortunately... I don't have the case files.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? What do you mean?
</line><line>Lang:
Access to those case files is restricted. It's being treated as highly classified information.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why is that?
</line><line>Lang:
I don't know, but it seems like there were a lot of things that they wanted to keep hidden. Even what I know... ...is limited to what was published in the newspapers back then.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That will not be a problem. In any case, please tell us what you know.
</line><line>Lang:
Sure... The <textEffects>SS-5 Incident</textEffects>... The incident occurred on a winter day 12 years ago... It was the 10th of February. The police department in this country received a call from a group of kidnappers. "<textEffects>We've kidnapped President Huang</textEffects>" ...they said.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kidnapped?
</line><line>Lang:
The <textEffects>SS-5 Incident</textEffects> was the case of President Huang's kidnapping. They demanded a ransom of <textEffects>100 million dollars</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
100 million!? ...Wait, just how much is that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's such a large amount, she's having trouble visualizing it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
That night, my old man was the last person to meet with the president. They were together at the Zheng Fa embassy until midnight on February 10th. After that, no one knows what the president was doing up until he was kidnapped. With the president's life at stake, the Zheng Fa government frantically gathered the money. After that, the ransom was delivered and the president was returned safe and sound.
</line><line>Kay:
So... President Huang has been the president since 12 years ago. That's really amazing.
</line><line>Lang:
Well... being in office for so long is just a small part of how amazing the man is.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Lang seemed a bit happy when he said that.)</textEffects> And, what happened to the kidnappers?
</line><line>Lang:
Well, a top secret covert investigation was carried out, then a secret trial was held.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A trial? Does that mean the suspect was caught?
</line><line>Lang:
The suspect was... <textEffects>Patricia Roland</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! Then, the reason you came to the prison a few days ago...
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. I was put on extended leave from Interpol... ...so I decided to go back and reinvestigate what happened 12 years ago. First, I had to get a look at the face of my target.
</line><line>Courtney:
...So the trial 12 years ago ended with a Not Guilty verdict.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... Back then, my old man was in charge of every aspect of the president's security. He took responsibility for the kidnapping and was relieved of his post as bodyguard... ...but he continued to investigate as a regular police officer, until... he finally found the culprit. And it was none other than <textEffects>Patricia Roland</textEffects>. There was no way she could be innocent! However, the result was a Not Guilty verdict. In the end, the case went unsolved... Crushed in both body and soul... my old man resigned from the police.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What was the basis for arresting Patricia Roland?
</line><line>Lang:
There was a lot of evidence. At least, that's what I think. But, I can't see those documents for myself... ...so that's where my story ends.
</line><line>Kay:
What should we do? With only this much information... ...even the <textEffects>Little Thief</textEffects> would have a hard time producing a re-creation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh... Is there really nothing we can do...?)</textEffects>
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>???:
Looks like you could use some help.
</line><line>Lang:
Who's that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Franziska!
</line><line>Kay:
And Mr. Shields too!
</line><line>Ray:
We finished up with the trial and finally managed to catch up with you guys.
</line><line>Franziska:
Here, take this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah! It's the <textEffects>case files for the SS-5 Incident</textEffects>, sir!
</line><line><textEffects>SS-5 Incident Files jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
When Roland mentioned "12 years ago" during the trial, it caught my interest. I looked into it immediately, and got it touch with Interpol.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I expected no less from you, Franziska.
</line><line>Franziska:
...Don't get the wrong idea, Miles Edgeworth. I didn't prepare these documents for you, the former prosecutor. I did it for the sake of the investigator taking up the case his father left behind.
</line><line>Lang:
Sis...! But, I thought information on the SS-5 Incident was restricted to the public.
</line><line>Franziska:
That restriction was placed by the prosecutor in charge of the case: <textEffects>Blaise Debeste</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste was the prosecutor in charge!?
</line><line>Lang:
Him...!
</line><line>Franziska:
However... ...as a result of the trial just now, Blaise's authority has been revoked. It's all thanks to his son...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sebastian...? <textEffects>(By bringing down his father, the door to this past case has been opened.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Franziska:
Prosecutor Debeste is currently wrapping things up in Patricia Roland's trial. He told me to relay this message to you. "Leave Pops and his cohorts to me. You guys just take care of the case on your end."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. He's become quite reliable, right before our very eyes...
</line><line>Courtney:
Truly...
</line><line>Kay:
Alrighty then! This is perfect! Now that we have the files, just leave the re-creation to me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Well then, let us begin. According to these documents... ...it appears that the incident took place right in front of the Tower Plaza.
</line><line>Kay:
Then let's head to the plaza right away!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 6, 3:25 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza</textEffects></center>
<line>Edgeworth:
Kay. Would you please activate the Little Mr. Thief?
</line><line>Kay:
Right! With these case files, re-creating everything should be a snap! Where should I start?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Where indeed. According to these documents... ...it seems there was a witness to the kidnapping of the president. A freelance journalist by the name of Jack Cameron. However... ...he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was murdered by the culprit...
</line><line>Lang:
So that would mean the place he saw the president at was <textEffects>here</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Here? ...At the Grand Tower?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No. The Grand Tower was only built around a year ago, Kay. Before that, this place contained mostly old abandoned buildings. However, 12 years ago, this place was...
</line><line>Lang:
Hah! Now you're finally talking about some stuff that I know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... 12 years ago, at the very spot was... ...the <textEffects>Happy Family Home</textEffects>.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What's that, pal?
</line><line>Lang:
It was a place where children who had lost their parents could live... ...or to put ot simply, it was an <textEffects>orphanage</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So the president was kidnapped at that <textEffects>orphanage</textEffects>...
</line><line>Lang:
...and, the head of that facility at the time was Patricia Roland. ...Apparently, Roland always referred to it as her <textEffects>Home</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems that suspicion would naturally fall upon her...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang... The darkness that remains from the SS-5 Incident still casts a shadow on the present case.)</textEffects> Kay, I'd like you to input the investigation data from Jack Cameron's murder case. We can probably assume that he was killed by one of the kidnappers.
</line><line>Kay:
So if we solve the murder case, we'll know who the kidnappers were, right!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. I'm counting on you.
</line>
<hr />
<line>John:
Wh-What the heck is this!? Everything's green!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I've come to expect such reactions...)</textEffects> This is a re-creation of the grounds of the facility that stood here 12 years ago... ...based on the documents from the police investigation.
</line><line>Kay:
I re-created the scene to show what it looked like when police arrived at 7 AM the next day!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It appears a fair amount of snow had piled up here.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. I heard that the footprints in the snow were prime pieces of evidence. The snow fell during the day, on the day of the incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

So Blaise was following Ms. Roland's instructions to dig it up? But, why would he dig up three holes?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The report didn't state which of three flowerbeds the item was in front of.

Oh. So Blaise didn't know exactly where to dig... That's why he had to dig up all three spots!

Most likely, yes. I'm sure Blaise himself was none too happy about that.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
We've learned pretty much all that we can about the situation at the time of the murder.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! In that case, is there another scene you'd like to re-create?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. Would you do the honors? I would like you to re-create the scene when the victim witnessed the president's kidnapping.
</line><line>Kay:
Right! I'll re-create the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Cameron is standing in the middle of the flowerbeds...
</line><line>Kay:
...and the president and his kidnapper are standing on the road.
</line><line>Lang:
My old man based his initial investigation on this man's eyewitness testimony. As a result, it led him to believe that the kidnapping and this facility were related.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And that's how... he came to suspect the head of the orphanage, Patricia Roland.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... But in court, Blaise Debeste treated this testimony as if it meant nothing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why would he do that?
</line><line>Lang:
The president and his kidnapper were not standing inside the orphanage grounds. So a connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping was difficult to prove.
</line><line>Kay:
I see. It's not like they were seen inside the orphanage, after all...
</line><line>Lang:
Tch! No matter how much evidence the detectives gather at the crime scene... ...it doesn't mean squat if the prosecutor won't use it in court! Blaise Debeste had some kind of connection with Patricia Roland. I figure they had some kind of deal going on.
</line><line>Kay:
In other words, you think that Blaise was <textEffects><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Was Blaise a kidnapper? Blaise had Patricia found not guilty. Were they partners in crime?">one of the kidnappers</textEffects></span><textEffects> (Was Blaise a kidnapper? Blaise had Patricia found not guilty. Were they partners in crime?)</textEffects></span>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, your father was convinced that Patricia Roland was the culprit... Your father was a highly capable investigator, I presume? Might he have had some other basis for his conclusion besides the eyewitness testimony?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... I figure he did. But I have no idea what it was. My old man never really talked much about this case...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang's father, Dai-Long Lang... President Huang's most trusted confidant. The <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects> he discovered was suppressed by Blaise Debeste. First, we must find that hidden truth...)</span>

<line>Edgeworth:
This snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Its right eye is missing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. And what's more, that missing eye happens to be in our possession.
</line><line>Kay:
The button that Mr. Cameron was holding onto! It's got the exact same design as the snowman's left eye!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we assume this button was indeed the snowman's eye... ...a huge contradiction arises. If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?
</line>



</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Edgeworth:
The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was <textEffects>stained with blood</textEffects>. In other words, he grabbed the button after he was attacked. For example, if we were to picture it in this way... After being struck in the back of the head, Mr. Cameron lost his balance. As he was falling, he reached out his hand towards the nearby snowman. However, it could not support his weight, and he collapsed while still grasping the button.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? Th-That means... ...Mr. Cameron was <textEffects>near the snowman</textEffects> when he was attacked!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. At the very least, he must have been within arm's reach, however... ...it's quite clear that he would not have been able to reach it from his current position.
</line><line>Kay:
But! Mr. Cameron's footprints only lead towards the flowerbed!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Can we be certain that those footprints really are Mr. Cameron's...? It seems we'll need to investigate them one more time.
</line><line>Kay:
Understood! I'll re-create the <textEffects>Time the Body Was Discovered</textEffects> scene one more time!
</line>

These footprints should match up with <textEffects>Mr. Cameron's shoes</textEffects>, right?

<line>Edgeworth:
As I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman.
</line><line>Kay:
Both the button Mr. Cameron was holding and the murder weapon came from there...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Also, if we assume that the killer picked up the brick near the snowman... ...and then tried to sneak up behind Mr. Cameron...
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! Mr. Cameron totally would've seen the person picking up the brick!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. Kay. Please update the re-creation. Mr. Cameron was not in the middle of the flowerbeds, but near the snowman.
</line><line>Kay:
'Kay! I'm on it!

<line>Kay:
No matter how you look at it, this is strange.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All the people involved in the case are gathered in the same place.
</line><line>Kay:
Did we make a mistake here or something?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(One piece of evidence this re-creation is based on is odd. If I had to choose which piece of evidence is fake... Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Was this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?
</line><line>Kay:
Ehhh!? What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We have proven that whoever killed Mr. Cameron also moved the body. For what reason would they have to deliberately move his body? Perhaps the culprit wanted to falsify the scene that Mr. Cameron witnessed.
</line><line>Kay:
And that's why they took a fake photo?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They made the president stand under the street light, and took a photo with Cameron's camera. It would have been quite simple.
</line><line>Kay:
Now that you mention it... Mr. Cameron's camera only had one photo on it, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. In all likelihood, the original roll of film had been removed from the camera... ...and after loading a new roll of film into the camera, the fake photo was taken.
</line><line>Kay:
I see! So, this photo must've been taken after Mr. Cameron was killed, right?
</line><line><textEffects>Cameron's Photo data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. This was not the scene Mr. Cameron actually witnessed. It's likely that this photo is forged evidence!
</line><line>Kay:
Then, where did Mr. Cameron witness the president and his kidnapper?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The photo isn't the only piece of evidence that indicates what Mr. Cameron witnessed...
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! The testimony he left on the answering machine!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. We should listen to the recording one more time and confirm what was said. <textEffects>(Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Cameron said this on the answering machine... "The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now." There are only two places here where the lights are broken...
</line><line>Kay:
The light by the orphanage!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay. Could you please update the re-creation?
</line><line>Kay:
Roger!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
This is...! So the kidnapper was near the orphanage!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. With this, we've shown the connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping.
</line><line>Lang:
So that's why they moved the body and took a fake photo to create false testimony! In order to remove any suspicion towards the orphanage in court!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm. With this, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. The <textEffects>Time the Body Was Discovered</textEffects> scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.
</line><line>Kay:
Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!

<line>Edgeworth:
This is a clear contradiction!
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? You mean this bloodstain?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you see how this bloodstain is broken up by the remains of the fire? This is proof that the fire occurred after the blood had scattered around the area.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh? But I thought the fire occurred before the murder...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that information is suspect as well. If the fire had broken out after the murder...
</line><line>Lang:
! ...then the child who started the fire should have seen the body and the bloodstains.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why then, did they not come forward as a witness? It's likely that would have put Blaise at a great disadvantage!
</line><line>Lang:
Guess we'll need to investigate this fire in more detail. Hey, you!
</line><line>MIB:
Yes, sir!
</line><line>Lang:
There should be some records of the fire in the police department under a different case file! I want you to bring me every last investigation report about the fire!
</line><line>MIB:
Understood, Shifu!
</line><line>Lang:
Oh, and one more thing...
</line><line>MIB:
What is it, sir?
</line><line>Lang:
Contact the House of Lang in Zheng Fa. There should be evidence from this case in my old man's room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Lang:
I just remembered... why I recognize this scene. A long time ago, I saw a picture in my old man's room. It was a drawing resembling this scene...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did you say!?
</line><line>Lang:
However, I think it looked like something a child drew.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A child...? Then the artist may have been the culprit behind the fire.
</line><line>Lang:
It should still be somewhere in my old man's room. Have them send it over here.

</line><line>Lang:
Yeah, sure.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to read it posthaste. The boy who started the fire snuck out of bed on the night of the incident. Hm? It seems this boy went missing several days later.

</line><line>Kay:
That's horrible! He was only a child, after all!

<textEffects>(While I'd hate for that to be the case, we can't rule out the possibility entirely.)</textEffects>

N-No way, you mean, this came off the president's...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You know of it?
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah. I've noticed the president kept it close by as a decoration. I always thought it was strange how one of the horns was missing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you twist the horn... this doll will play back any previously recorded audio.
</line><line>Kay:
So if we put the missing horn back in place... we might be able to hear a different recording!

</line><line>Courtney:
Of course he knew. John's mother... Amy Marsh, passed away about 5 years ago. She and I were cousins. Since we were young, we've always been really close. We were often mistaken for sisters. That's why, when she passed away... ...I thought it was only natural that I look after John. Also... There were circumstances which prevented me from revealing his father's identity.

Amy... couldn't make it. Apparently, someone had been following her the whole night.

I brought a bouquet of <textEffects>lion lilies</textEffects>... ...so that he would understand I truly did know about Amy. Those flowers are a dear memory to the president and Amy.

There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.
The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.
However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.
If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.
Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.

</line><line>Lang:
However, there's one thing I still don't get.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Something you don't get?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
It's this. Why did they need to take a <textEffects>fake photo</textEffects>? Why would they go through all that trouble and even make the president take part in the photo?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's true. However, the answer to that riddle must lie somewhere within... Once we get past the layers upon layers of deductions, we shall surely reach it.
</line><line>Lang:
Yeah... That's right. I'd like to hear your deductions as well.

<center><textEffects>-- Truth of the SS-5 Incident --</textEffects></center>
<line>Lang:
<textEffects>There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Lang:
<textEffects>Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kay:
Is this the truth of the SS-5 Incident?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. What's the matter?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is still something hidden behind this case...
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is a piece of evidence that cannot be explained by Agent Lang's theory. As long as there's a contradiction, we'll have to present it in order to advance our reasoning...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If the eyewitness, Cameron, had not been there, no murder would have taken place... Is that really the case?
</line><line>Lang:
...The criminal's goal was only to kidnap the president. If there were no witness, there would've been no need to commit murder. Right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what if Cameron wasn't the only one who was murdered? There was a large bloodstain near the flowerbeds. However, Cameron was murdered... ...near the snowman. Ergo, this bloodstain could not have belonged to Cameron! Someone else's blood was spilled. And quite a vast amount at that...
</line><line>Lang:

</line><line>Lang:
......Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Do you have any idea what you're saying?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I do... It's hard to believe, however, that is what the evidence indicates... On that night, 12 years ago, there were <textEffects>two</textEffects> murders.
</line><line>Lang:
Are you saying that the other murder was covered up!? Who... just who the heck could have been killed?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A murder that was cleverly concealed. All traces of it were erased... And the incident itself was completely deleted from the case files. However, there's one thing... One piece of evidence that still remains intact after 12 years!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This piece of evidence shows that something happened that night!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The other murder incident was buried in the dark by Blaise Debeste... However, there is still one piece of evidence that remains. Agent Lang... It survived by your father's hands.
</line><line>Lang:
My old man... you say?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please recall. There was one more thing that was hidden along with the traces of the murder. And that is, the existence of the boy who caused the fire...! Why did Blaise make the boy disappear? It's because he saw <textEffects>something that he wasn't supposed to see</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
What was the thing he wasn't supposed to see!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Everything is drawn in this picture.
</line><line>Lang:
The drawing my old man had!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The person drawn on the right is most likely the president. The Moozilla doll is also drawn near him. <textEffects>And the person standing opposite him is...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
A man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen.
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaaaaaaaat!? The assassin!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why would an assassin appear before a president? The answer is clear. Indeed, what occurred that night on the orphanage grounds 12 years ago was not a kidnapping. <textEffects>It was a presidential assassination!</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOOWL!
</line><line>Kay:
Th-Then, Ms. Roland and Mr. Blaise were...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. The two were likely partners in crime. One furnished the orphanage to use as the scene of the incident... ...and the other covered up the young boy's testimony. It's likely that Mr. Cameron was murdered because he witnessed the assassination itself. After all, the kidnapping never actually happened!
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Stop messing around! You're saying that the president was assassinated 12 years ago? We just found his body today! He's been alive up until now!
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! I mean, we met him ourselves!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If the president was assassinated 12 years ago, and the president's body was found today... ...that would imply there were <textEffects>two presidents</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah! And that can't be right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you sure about that? There is the possibility that there were two presidents. <textEffects>(That's right... Up until now, I've been getting a strange feeling from the president...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lang:
Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The image of President Huang that Agent Lang described...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Huang:
You... you are wrong... I...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...He revealed his true form.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...differs far too greatly from the President Huang we know! It's as if they were two entirely different people! If there were, in fact, two Zheng Fa presidents... ...exactly how would such a scenario be possible?)</textEffects> What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
If we were to assume that one of them was a <textEffects>body double</textEffects>, wouldn't it be possible then?
</line><line>Lang:
A body double...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
President Huang possessed immense power and authority in Zheng Fa. I'm sure there were those who envied his position and made attempts on his life. Yes. Just as he was attacked a few days ago at Gourd Lake.
</line><line>Lang:
It's true, there were those who sought Huang's life from time to time. But, I can't easily believe there were two presidents. At least, not without any evidence!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction? Or... has he noticed it, but can't admit it?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lang:
What is it, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't shout something out only to suddenly clam up.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
According to the recording on the doll, the president visited the orphanage at midnight. However... that should not have been possible.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!? Why's that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why? Because at the time, the president should have been at the embassy. He was together with Agent Lang's father...
</line><line>Lang:
............
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So, Agent Lang, you really did notice.)</textEffects> He was in two places at the same time. Ergo, there must have been two presidents.
</line><line>Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOWL!
</line><line>Courtney:
Then, which of the two was the real president on that day 12 years ago!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Most likely the one who died.
</line><line>Lang:
Who!? Who contracted Dogen to murder Huang?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(In order to learn that, first... ...we must have a look at the evidence that we proved was false earlier. And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered. And he was murdered because he witnessed the presidential assassination... In other words, the photo must have been taken following the assassination. Given that, who is the president pictured in the fake photo? ...We must consider him to be the <textEffects>body double</textEffects>.
</line><line>Lang:
In other words, the <textEffects>body double</textEffects> had the real president murdered and then took his place!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Patricia Roland and Blaise must have cooperated in that plan.
</line><line>Lang:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lang:
Hold it! Huang's body was never found! Just where could it have disappeared to!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The answer to that is already quite apparent...! <textEffects>This is where the real president's body was!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands. That item was not the ransom... It was something far more important.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! So Blaise unburied the...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...the real president's body! The possibility is quite high.
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you saaaayy!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The bones from the body buried 12 years ago would have still remained. According to Mr. Powers, construction was to begin soon at this lot. That was the deadline... ...both for the movie and <textEffects>retrieval of the body</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Because they would've found the body when they started the construction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! Let us search the footprints that Blaise dug up!
</line><line>Lang:
...Yeah. If the body was buried there, there'd be traces of it. Hey! Somebody call forensics!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Forensics:
I have the results of the search! We've found traces in the dirt that suggest a body was buried here!
</line><line>Lang:
Tch... So, it was Huang after all?
</line><line>Forensics:
We also recovered the skeletal remains that Blaise Debeste dug up. They were in his home. In addition to the bone structure, the dental records and the bone fractures all match up. We can confirm that it was indeed President Huang!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So the real President Huang was indeed killed 12 years ago. The SS-5 Incident was a murder.
</line><line><textEffects>Monster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
So the SS-5 Incident was actually a murder incident! But there's so much information, it's way too confusing...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Let us take this opportunity to review the details of the case.
</line><line>Kay:
First, the real president came to the orphanage, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Twelve years ago... ...the true President Huang visited the orphanage in order to meet his son. The footsteps in the snow that we thought belonged to Mr. Cameron... ...were most likely made by the president at that time. President Huang was supposed to meet his son here... However, the one who actually showed up was the assassin, Sirhan Dogen.
</line><line>Kay:
He came here to meet his son, but was murdered instead... How horrible...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A man like Dogen... shows no mercy. ...And after that, the second tragedy occurred.
</line><line>Kay:
You mean Mr. Cameron's murder?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Mr. Cameron saw the decisive moment. After the real president was killed by Dogen... ...his body was carried to the rear courtyard by the team of kidnappers. Mr. Cameron must have witnessed that moment... ...from the orphanage entrance. Although, he himself believed that he had actually witnessed a kidnapping. Furthermore, by this time...
</line><line>Kay:
...the body double, who had come to meet up with Blaise and Ms. Roland... ...was already standing behind Mr. Cameron.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And then the witness to the incident, Mr. Cameron...
</line><line>Kay:
...was killed by the body double. So, was Mr. Cameron's corpse also carried by the body double?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, that seems likely.
</line><line>Kay:
But, there wasn't anything at the crime scene that looked like the body double's footprints!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. I've already figured out how he accomplished that. There is a piece of evidence that would've made it possible. <textEffects>What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse. After Mr. Cameron was killed... ...the president's body double carried him into the middle of the garden. I suspect the body double was wearing the same shoes as the real president at the time. If he made sure to step precisely on top of the footprints left by the real president...
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Since the shoes were the same... ...there would only be one set of footprints left behind in the snow. I think I've got a pretty good grasp on the SS-5 Incident now. But, there's still one thing I don't get.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What's that?
</line><line>Kay:
Why did they need to stage the abduction?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because Mr. Cameron witnessed the incident. He saw the president at the orphanage. He left behind witness testimony on Ms. Crane's answering machine. Even Blaise couldn't make that disappear. Ergo, the body double needed a reason for the president to have been at the orphanage.
</line><line>Kay:
And that's why they prepared the fake kidnapping charade.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The people in the fake photo are the body double, and most likely, Patricia Roland.
</line><line>Kay:
The person in the coat is Ms. Roland? What makes you say that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The two would have to leave the orphanage in order to take the picture. Just like when he moved the body, the double used the real president's footprints.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! So the second set of footprints must belong to the person in the coat!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. We originally believed that those footprints belonged to Cameron's killer. They were size 7 footprints, too small for Blaise's feet. Thus, we can presume that the person playing the part of the kidnapper was Patricia Roland. Hidden in the shadow of the presidential kidnapping was a presidential assassination...
</line><line>Lang:
I see... So that's why my old man...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why he... what?
</line><line>Lang:
The old man must have realized that a murder had taken place. ...After all, he had the kid's drawing.
</line><line>Courtney:
However, that picture was never presented as evidence...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your father likely took it from the young witness during the investigation and hid it.
</line><line>Lang:
He had to have known that Huang was dead. But what if he had revealed that back then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Reveal the death of the president, the backbone of Zheng Fa? It would have caused chaos...
</line><line>Lang:
...and that's why my old man took the secret to his grave. He even took the blame for the kidnapping, knowing that would be the fall of the House of Lang!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So this is the truth that Agent Lang's father hid 12 years ago...
</line><line>Kay:
And now, it's all become clear.
</line><line><textEffects>SS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...Is that really the case, I wonder?
</line><line>Kay:
Huh!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Lang:
Who's there!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That bell... it's...!)</textEffects> ...Sirhan Dogen!
</line><line>Lang:
You! Why are you here!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
How can you just brazenly show up here!? Who do you think you are, pal!?
</line><line>Dogen:
I found the conversation most intriguing, and I just... well...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. Are you feeling nostalgic about an old murder of yours?
</line><line>Lang:
You're the one who killed Huang...!
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. Nostalgia? I think not. You were speaking about the person I am searching for.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're searching for someone?
</line><line>Dogen:
I escaped from prison in order to meet with a young acolyte... The one who wore the <textEffects>red raincoat</textEffects>...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The <textEffects>red raincoat</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Kay:
Wh-Who is this person?
</line><line>Dogen:
I suspect that it's the same person as the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> you are searching for.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
<textEffects>Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The red hood?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Dogen:
Don't they seem surprised, Anubis? Yes, yes they are, my boy. Twelve years ago, this young acolyte saved my life...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Dogen's Savior --</textEffects></center>
<line>Dogen:
Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.
However, my life was also targeted on that day.
The body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.
Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.
But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
So your client was indeed the body double, who was the main perpetrator of the crime.
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. It was a long time ago, but I remember his words even now.
</line>
<hr />
<line><textEffects>There have been countless attempts on my life. Not just once or twice. Countless! And yet, why must I be the only one to face the danger? When I stand before the people, I garner the same respect as the president does. Tell me, just what is the difference between him and me!?</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Dogen:
The difference was great. While the voice and style of speech may be the same... Keh heh heh. One can mimic the body, but the heart cannot be reproduced.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I suppose his own weaknesses cost him in his quest to become a leader.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Knightley:
Now that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!
</line><line>de Killer:
I'm not sure if you're as capable as Rooke was...
</line><line>Knightley:
Wh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmph... perhaps the king and his knight were not so different after all.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
The double believed that the president's only weakness was a woman called Amy. To find the woman, he needed the assistance of someone from this country.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, he joined forced with Blaise...
</line><line>Dogen:
After determining her whereabouts, he simply waited for the right opportunity.
</line><line>Kay:
That chance came with the meeting at the orphanage.
</line><line>Dogen:
Indeed. The director of the orphanage was bribed and brought in as an accomplice.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He must be referring to Patricia Roland.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
Well. Given what I've told you, do you realize the whereabouts of the young acolyte now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mean the boy who saved you. But, how do you know that he is the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>?
</line><line>Dogen:
...That day, the young one caused a fire at the garden of the orphanage.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! You're talking about the kid who started the fire as a prank!
</line><line>Dogen:
A prank...? Keh heh heh, not at all. On that night 12 years ago, the young acolyte was hiding inside the igloo... It seems he witnessed Patricia Roland and Blaise moving the body from his hiding place. Apparently, he heard them talking during that time. It would seem that they were planning to kill me because I knew the truth. He immediately came to the main hall to tell me that. I learned this about the young acolyte some time later... It seems he was wearing a <textEffects>red raincoat</textEffects> at the time. He led me out of the main hall. And then, the young acolyte... ...said he was going to get rid of our footprints. So he scattered some lamp oil near the igloo over the snow. Then he boldly set the oil ablaze!
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! No way! So he set the fire in order to...!
</line><line>Dogen:
All their focus was diverted towards the burning flames. I took the opportunity to escape through the rear exit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, the boy in the red raincoat is the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind this case?
</line><line>Dogen:
Exactly. Isn't that right, Anubis? Yes, boy. Yes it is.
</line>
<hr />

</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>The 24th of December, 18 years ago</textEffects>... Are you sure about that?
</line><line>Dogen:
There is no mistake.
</line><line>Ray:
C-Could that mean...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I know... the significance behind that date.)</textEffects> <textEffects>What shows the significance of the date when Dogen found the children?</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Dogen:
<textEffects>But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kay:
Mr. Dogen and that "acolyte" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps there is a hint to the <textEffects>mastermind's</textEffects> motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia...
</line><line>Ray:
We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago...
</line><line>Dogen:
Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What makes sense?
</line><line>Dogen:
One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester.
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
They lost their memories?
</line><line>Dogen:
The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name.
</line><line>Kay:
So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. <textEffects>(However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind's</textEffects> identity...)</span> Dogen... Would you please continue your story?
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh. Very well.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>-- Dogen and the "Acolyte" --</textEffects></center>
<line>Dogen:
I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.
Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.
Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.
I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double.
</line><line>Kay:
And Ms. Roland was the warden of Mr. Dogen's prison.
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger.
</line><line>Dogen:
That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears.
</line>
<hr />
<line><textEffects>I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Huang:
...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone...
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life.
</line><line>Huang:
.........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Dogen:
I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance?
</line><line>Kay:
Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see John's horns?
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He said that the president made "preparations" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word "preparations" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.)</textEffects> ........That's it!
</line><line>Lang:
There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world.
</line><line>Dogen:
The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using John!)</textEffects>
</line><line>John:
..........
</line><line>Dogen:
The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So Dogen cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son.

<line>Dogen:
<textEffects>I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
This ring is...!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, what is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring!
</line><line>Ray:
Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident?
</line><line>Ray:
After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person.
</line><line><textEffects>Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son...
</line><line>Ray:
The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal.
</line><line>Kay:
If someone involved in the <textEffects>IS-7 Incident</textEffects> was his chess opponent...
</line><line>Lang:
Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind this case!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident.
</line><line>Ray:
How about that. The only one who could be the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> was himself a murder victim...?
</line><line>Kay:
But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?)</textEffects>

<line>Kay:
OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this "acolyte"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. <textEffects>(What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this "acolyte": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.
</line><line>Dogen:
Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor.
</line><line>Dogen:
What? That... cannot be.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean...?
</line><line>Kay:
So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could another person have acted as a middleman between Dogen and Knightley?
</line><line>Kay:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Dogen wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters.
</line><line>Ray:
And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Dogen.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, that is indeed true.
</line><line><textEffects>Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual... Dogen, were the letters that reached you...
</line><line>Dogen:
They were in <textEffects>braille</textEffects>, of course.
</line><line>Ray:
So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well.
</line><line>Dogen:
Oh...? Then that somebody must be...

You're saying there's someone else who's the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>.
</line><line>Lang:
You mean, <textEffects>Dane Gustavia's son</textEffects>...? But, who the heck is he?

Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale!

Ms. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you.
</line><line>Nicole:
Wh-What! Ya mean me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You said that you recorded the <textEffects>sound of Moozilla spewing flames</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?
</line><line>Nicole:
That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Nicole:
That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Could you let us listen to the tape?
</line><line>Nicole:
Sure thing. ...There we go!

Sure did, right here in this photo.

Precisely, Detective. The <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator!
</line><line>Kay:
Wouldn't that mean... that the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> is someone connected to the circus?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request.
</line><line>Lang:
A request...? What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>, we may require assistance from a certain someone... <textEffects>(I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!)</textEffects>

Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Simon:
Are you guys here for the show?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes... Ms. Berry...
</line><line>Simon:
You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this.
</line><line>Simon:
...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your "performance" has already surprised me, Mr. Keyes.
</line><line>Simon:
..........
</line><line>Regina:
Umm. But he hasn't performed yet...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus?
</line><line>Regina:
Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating.
</line><line>Regina:
Huh!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who is in charge of the balloon?
</line><line>Regina:
Well, th-that would be S-Simon, but... A-Are you saying...!?
</line><line>Simon:
.........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not?
</line><line>Simon:
...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and "not much of a pilot"?
</line><line>Simon:
Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Keyes.
</line><line>Simon:
No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's not all. You drugged John at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Patricia Roland?
</line><line>Simon:
No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself!
</line><line>Simon:
Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.)</textEffects> We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
I'm so sad... Those words were all lies...
</line><line>Kay:
I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...!
</line><line>Simon:
Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply...

You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> the entire case!
</line><line>Simon:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simon Keyes. I indict you!
</line><line>Simon:
...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!)</textEffects> So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simon Keyes.
</line><line>Regina:
S-Simon! That's not... true, is it!?
</line><line>Simon:
Truth or lie... What difference does it make?
</line><line>Regina:
Huh!?
</line><line>Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right?

<line>Simon:
It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.
That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.
I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.
There's nothing unusual about that, right?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon?
</line><line>Simon:
Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Regina, is that true?
</line><line>Regina:
Y-Yup. It was Simon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating.
</line><line>Simon:
Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story.

<textEffects>It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.</textEffects>

<line>Simon:
<textEffects>The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?
</line><line>Simon:
Blue? So what if it is?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Today, we saw a blue truck carrying a large basket. If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie.

Agent Lang! Ema!
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago!
</line><line>Lang:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot.
</line><line><textEffects>Lion Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today.

There are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one?
</line><line>Kay:
It's definitely that one! I got a good look at it!
</line><line>Edgeworth?:

</line><line>Kay:
Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-It wasn't me...!
</line><line>Simon:
<textEffects>"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up."</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice!
</line><line>Simon:
<textEffects>"Evidence! Present evidence!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.
</line><line>Kay:
You can figure all that out just by touching it!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.
</line><line>Simon:
Eh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! <textEffects>(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Simon:
Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation?
</line><line>Ema:
That's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wait... You want me to do it?
</line><line>Ema:
Of course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Umm... Alright, then. <textEffects>(You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
First, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
The powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Blow it away?
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Got it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, I think so. <textEffects>(I guess we'll do it for real this time...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Just so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over.
</line>

<line>Ema:
We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's run the prints against mine posthaste.
</line><line>Ema:
Alright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie.
</line><line>Simon:
Ugh!
</line><line>Lang:
What were you doing when you were driving this truck around?
</line><line>Simon:
Just... taking it for a joyride?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby.
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
This all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you?
</line><line>Simon:
Isn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit?
</line><line>Simon:
Oh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>What did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of <textEffects>sleeping drugs</textEffects> was found lying in the place where John was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay.
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...! <textEffects>(Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
The police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Simon:
Then show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
Now then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me...

</line><line>Ray:
Now, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simon... You're looking good in that clown makeup!
</line><line>Simon:
H-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that...
</line><line>Ray:
Uncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick?
</line><line>Kay:
At last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simon impression! <textEffects>"O-Objectiooon...!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
Wha... Wh-Why you! Enough already!
</line><line>Ray:
...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence <span style="color:#E16935">not related to the kidnapping</textEffects> that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the <textEffects>young acolyte</textEffects> Dogen was looking for. If I can just connect the <textEffects>young acolyte</textEffects> to Simon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the <textEffects>mastermind's</textEffects> true identity...?)</span>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual...
</line><line>Dogen:
Oh...? Then that somebody must be...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind the case.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's it... The <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</textEffects> played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simon, then...!)</span>
</line><line>Simon:
That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. <textEffects>(Though you may have taken it a little too far...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
You sure look happy. I take it you've found something?
</line><line>Kay:
<textEffects>"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!"</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Keyes. Do you happen to like chess?
</line><line>Simon:
Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> played correspondence chess with Sirhan Dogen.
</line><line>Simon:

</line><line>Simon:
If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Dogen, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There was no way Knightley could have been the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>. The reason being... ...the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Dogen and Knightley.
</line><line>Simon:
So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Patricia Roland.
</line><line>Kay:
N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!?
</line><line>Simon:

What are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks!

</line><line>Simon:
If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Simon:
I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, that's correct... <textEffects>(Does she know something?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Regina:
This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simon.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Simon:
What did you say...!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!)</textEffects> Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter!
</line><line>Regina:
OK! Here you go.

Quick, open it!

This is... a correspondence chess letter!

<textEffects>Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right?</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late.
</line><line>Regina:
Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, why was this letter addressed to you?
</line><line>Simon:
.....Ngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is proof that you were the middleman between Dogen and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Dogen. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley!
</line><line>Simon:
Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!?
</line><line>Kay:
Simon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend?
</line><line>Simon:
Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend <textEffects>18 years ago</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the <textEffects>IS-7 Incident</textEffects>?
</line><line>Simon:
...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, "<textEffects>My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!</textEffects>"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
<textEffects>Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are <span style="color:#E16935">the best in the world</textEffects>...!</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha...!
</line><line>Kay:
Your father...!
</line><line>Simon:
Horace Knightley was the <textEffects>son of the murderer</textEffects> who killed my father!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover...
</line><line>Simon:
Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia.
</line><line>Simon:
Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you knew who the culprit was all along?
</line><line>Simon:
Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding.
</line><line>Simon:
Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet.
</line><line>Simon:
Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father.
</line><line>Simon:
...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. <textEffects>This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Simon:
What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I want you to take a good look at this ring's design.
</line><line>Simon:
...There are two letters inscribed in it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of <textEffects>Isaac Dover</textEffects>.
</line><line>Simon:
! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The police had found <textEffects>Isaac Dover's son</textEffects> and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is <textEffects>Horace Knightley</textEffects>.
</line><line>Simon:
Wh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In other words... you are <textEffects>Dane Gustavia's son</textEffects>!
</line><line>Simon:
That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Knightley:
Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well.
</line><line>Simon:
......Yes. Please look forward to it.
</line><line>Knightley:
Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move!
</line><line>Simon:
Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later.
</line><line>Knightley:
Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.
</line><line>Simon:
......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this.
</line><line>Knightley:
Huh? Did you say something?
</line><line>Simon:
Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Dogen's footsteps!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This finally proves it... Simon Keyes! You are Dogen's correspondence chess partner... ...and the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind this case!
</line><line>Simon:
............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects> behind it all!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's finally showing his true colors...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simon Keyes...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Patricia. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you.
</line><line>Simon:
Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Patricia Roland was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Dogen... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Dogen, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
</line><line>Simon:
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The evidence from Patricia Roland's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...)</textEffects> I see. So that's why you kidnapped John... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence!
</line><line>Simon:

</line><line>Simon:
Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap John in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise!
</line><line>Simon:

</line><line>Simon:
That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So you admit it. Your motive was <textEffects>revenge</textEffects>.
</line><line>Simon:
Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.....!
</line><line>Simon:
Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other.
</line><line>Courtney:
Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!?
</line><line>Simon:
Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So that was also a part of his plan...!)</textEffects> If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your...
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out!
</line><line>Kay:
How can you say such a thing...!?
</line><line>Simon:
It was the same for Patricia Roland. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!?
</line><line>Simon:
That's right! I thought it would bring Dogen to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Patricia to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A pawn... Me...?
</line><line>Simon:
When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Patricia to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I didn't solve those cases for your sake!
</line><line>Simon:
Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a <textEffects>defense attorney</textEffects>, didn't you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What did you...!?
</line><line>Simon:
All I had to do was go, "nowaynowaynoway" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...?
</line><line>Simon:
To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney!
</line><line>Kay:
You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Kay...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!?
</line><line>Kay:
Absolutely not! That's not true at all!
</line><line>Ray:
Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, <textEffects>Simon himself</textEffects>. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend...
</line><line>Simon:
Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However...

<center><textEffects>-- Instigating Murder? --</textEffects></center>
<line>Simon:
Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?
I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?
If I had said the word "kill" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.
Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
What are you saying!? You kidnapped me!
</line><line>Simon:
I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters.
</line><line>Kay:
That's...!
</line><line>Simon:
Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh... <textEffects>(You crafty little...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself.
</line><line>Kay:
So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders!
</line><line>Simon:
You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion.

The police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run!
</line><line>Simon:
Really now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos?
</line><line>Lang:
What'd you say!? You... can't be serious...
</line><line>Simon:
Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took John hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting!
</line><line>Courtney:
I-I will never allow you to do such a thing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I can't tell whether or not Simon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections!

Kay.
</line><line>Kay:

<textEffects>(Only Kay... came into contact with Simon... If any sound was recorded at the time she was with the culprit...)</textEffects> Ms. Swift! How long have you been recording?
</line><line>Nicole:
Since two nights ago, I reckon...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Since two nights ago... In that case... When could a conversation with Simon possibly have been recorded?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Two nights ago... Simon brought Kay to the roof. If we listen to the recording from that time frame...!)</textEffects> Ms. Swift! Please let us listen to the recording from two nights ago!
</line><line>Nicole:
Huh? O-Okie-dokie!
</line><line><textEffects>........</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Th-This is...! The sound of a hot air balloon!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's right. At the time, Simon was carrying Kay in a hot air balloon. Ergo, he was near Kay.
</line><line>Simon:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Isn't there anything recorded?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>........ .....*BANG*... *CLANG*</textEffects>

Ah! Th-That was...!

...a-a gunshot!
</line><line>Simon:

</line><line><textEffects>...*vrrr*... *bzt*</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. It seems you were quick to deactivate the bug. However... you were a little too late. You can't run anymore. That gunshot ties you to the case!
</line><line>Simon:
Huh? What are you saying? There's no gun involved in this case, is there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(No... there should be someone connected to the case who fired a gun. Let's strike with the evidence that points to that person!)</textEffects> <textEffects>Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report... Gunpowder residue was detected on his right hand.
</line><line>Simon:
...Ngh.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Where was Kay at the time this gunshot was recorded? That's right. She was being carried to the roof of the Grand Tower in your balloon. And as it turns out, there were a few more people on that very same rooftop at the time...
</line><line>Courtney:
You mean the double and me... Ah! Certainly, after we talked for a brief moment... ...the body double noticed something and had me leave before him.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now, what if the gunshot rang out after that? We clearly hear it in the recording. I doubt that you wouldn't have noticed it.
</line><line>Simon:
.......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you intend to feign ignorance until the very end?
</line><line>Simon:
That's nothing more than mere conjecture.

If you listen closely, you can hear the bullet hitting something!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If the body double was aiming at Simon, then...)</textEffects> <textEffects>The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon. If we assume that the bullet hit something... it would have been the balloon's basket.
</line><line>Kay:
Let's examine it immediately!
</line>




<line>Edgeworth:
This hole...!
</line><line>Kay:
It's a bullet hole!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A bullet hole was found in the basket. You won't be able to talk your way out of this one.

Keh heh heh. So you've figured it out. You're good. I guess it's impossible to hide anything from you.

OK, OK. No need to be impatient!

<line>Simon:
It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.
I saw the body double and you, Ms. Courtney, on the roof. Talk about a surprise.
Only the double noticed me. He told Ms. Courtney to leave ahead of him.
He then pointed a gun at me and fired.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Why did he want to shoot down the balloon?
</line><line>Simon:
It's simple. The body double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney.
</line><line>Courtney:
K-Kill me...?
</line><line>Simon:
That's right! You talked to the double about John, didn't you? Well, it's not like the body double would have met with you otherwise... From his point of view, it was like showing him evidence that he was a fake.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mean, he was afraid of Judge Courtney because she knew about John's past?
</line><line>Simon:
Afraid... That's exactly right! That body double was a coward, after all. I even remember how his hands were trembling when he fired the gun at my balloon. Are we all clear now? I was only there by chance. Just a friendly witness who was passing by.

So, wouldn't that mean he saved her life!?

The body double could not have entered the storeroom on the 51st floor two nights ago. Ms. Hart's testimony proves it.

At times like this, you should take a breather and think back. "<textEffects>Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger</textEffects>." The point of contention between your logic and his claims lies in the body double's escape route. How's about... for example, we think of it like this...

<textEffects>(Circumstances that would have allowed the body double to get on the balloon...? That's right. The body double not only had a large build,  but he also had a gun. And in spite of that, no traces of sleeping drugs were found in his system... Which means..... it can't be!)</textEffects>

<center><textEffects>-- The Murder of the Double --</textEffects></center>
<line>Simon:
<textEffects>Manipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Simon:
<textEffects>I did the same thing to Knightley and Blaise.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Simon:
<textEffects>At any rate, there's no way the body double could've gone for a ride in my balloon.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Simon:
<textEffects>The double was crushed by the monster's head, right?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Simon:
<textEffects>And who was it that caused the monster's head to fall?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Kay:
Darn it! Does he intend to play innocent until the very end!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The body double's cause of death was rather unique. If he was crushed under the monster's head...
</line><line>Kay:
...then, the killer would be John after all. Isn't there anything else that could've crushed the trouble?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Something else that could have crushed the body double...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
John was not the one who killed the body double. He was <textEffects>crushed by a monster</textEffects>...
</line><line>Simon:
Ahah! Quit clowning around! This isn't like you at all! Oh, I get it! Since John is supposed to understand the heart of a monster.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The one who understands the heart of monsters is you.
</line><line>Simon:
Not even I have monsters for friends, y'know?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Stop being so modest. Didn't you have one very important friend? A <textEffects>monster</textEffects> you control at will! Simon Keyes! You're the one who killed the body double!
</line><line>Simon:
...Th-That's...!
</line><line>Lang:
The Lion Balloon...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A monster made of cloth that expands when filled with hot air... It suits you quite well, wouldn't you agree?
</line><line>Simon:
Sorry, but... I have no idea what you're talking about.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You've been fixated on your claims that you manipulated John and the body double. Probably because it's an impossible fantasy of yours. ...After all, even an animal tamer cannot tame the dead. The body double had already been murdered while he was on the roof... ...and the murder weapon was the balloon you were in!
</line><line>Simon:
...Ngh!
</line><line>Lang:
I see. Although it floats in the air, that balloon still weighs several hundred pounds.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
When the double threatened you on the rooftop... ...you immediately came up with a plan to defend yourself. And that plan was to crush him with your balloon. Whether the body double wanted to get on, or that he was carrying a gun... None of that matters. Because what you carried in your balloon was the body double's corpse!
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
Hold on a second, Mr. Edgeworth. You're saying the double was killed on the rooftop <textEffects>two nights ago</textEffects>? Well, that simply doesn't match up with the <textEffects>time of death</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What... did you say?
</line><line>Simon:
That's not like you at all, Mr. Edgeworth. Take a good look at the autopsy report. The time of death was <textEffects>around 11 PM last night</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Nngghhh!
</line><line>Kay:
L-Last night...!
</line><line>Simon:
That's right... the very night that Moozilla's head fell!
</line><line>John:
......!
</line><line>Simon:
Well, Johnny-boy! Come on! How about telling us the truth! You killed your father, right!? I know the feeling... You hated him, didn't you? Your father who left you all alone forever!
</line><line>John:
Y-You're wrong! I had no idea that guy was my dad!
</line><line>Simon:
Not this again. Didn't I personally tell you myself!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Ngh! Was my logic wrong?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to thank you once again. For chasing down Blaise and Patricia and bringing them both to ruin. My revenge was a success, all thanks to your logic!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If only the time of death matched up, then my logic would fit... Perhaps... he did something to <span style="color:#E16935">throw off the time of death</textEffects>?)</span>
</line><line>Simon:
And what's more, <textEffects>Dane Gustavia</textEffects>... was it? You even took down the culprit of the IS-7 Incident.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Dane Gustavia... and the IS-7 Incident...! That's it! Gustavia killed Dover and <span style="color:#E16935">hid his body in a block of ice</textEffects>...!)</span>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
</line><line>Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
GYAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's a shame that I didn't get to witness his destruction!
</line><line>Kay:
H-How can you say that!? Wasn't Mr. Gustavia your father, Simon?
</line><line>Simon:
............
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
<textEffects>I'm scared... I'm so scared. Ms. Roland keeps asking me about that day. Daddy, help me...! Why won't you come save me? Is it... because I broke my promise with you and didn't eat your sweets......?</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
I couldn't care less. My father left me all alone. Even if we share the same blood, that man is not my father!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I hate to say it, but... Like father, like son. You're the spitting image of him, Simon. The father you hated so much...
</line><line>Simon:
Huh? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It must have been fate... By sheer coincidence, you just happened to use the exact same method your father did... ...to <textEffects>throw off the victim's time of death</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!
</line><line>Lang:
A refrigerated warehouse?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
You're saying that I threw off the time of death? H-How would I have done that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The answer lies in where you hid the body double's body! <textEffects>This was the place you used to hide the body!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Throwing off the time of death by freezing the body, along with John's kidnapping. Hmph... it seems that everything is coming together.
</line><line>Simon:
The kidnapping? Why are we going back to that? ...I don't know a thing about it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't forget. John was confined in a <textEffects>refrigerated warehouse</textEffects>. That's right... you kept the body double's corpse in that very same warehouse! 18 years ago, your father hid a body in the same way!
</line><line>Simon:
W... What? My father... the one who abandoned me, did the same thing?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who would've gussed... that both father and son would use the same method.
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
Stop it! Don't lump me in with that guy! My father... I'm nothing like him! There's not a single connection between us!
</line><line>Ray:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ray:
You may think so, but even now, your bond with Mr. Gustavia still remains. Didn't you say once before, "<textEffects>I don't like sweets</textEffects>"? That... may have come from the shock of losing your father, don't you think?
</line><line>Simon:
Ngh...! You guys have no idea what you're saying...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Even if you deny your father, aren't your thoughts and actions the same? Particularly, your belief of "<textEffects>sacrificing others to protect yourself</textEffects>". And finally... your crimes were brought to light, just as his were!
</line><line>Simon:
Uuh... UUuuungh........ Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .....Just kidding. Ahahahaha! I don't know anything about that warehouse. I had nothing to do with the kidnapping, after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In order to threaten Judge Courtney... it's clear that you partook in the kidnapping!
</line><line>Simon:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
How scary. Those who get involved with you will be charged with all sorts of crimes. In the end, there's no evidence. For the instigation, and for the kidnapping. None at all. Or what? Are you gonna forge some evidence? Just like Blaise and the rest?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh! I-I'll do nothing of the sort! <textEffects>(I-I can't let him provoke me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
You always say, "<textEffects>I'll pursue the truth, no matter what</textEffects>," right? Hah! Don't you mean only the "<textEffects>truth</textEffects>" that's most convenient to you? After all, that's how the police pull the wool over the eyes of those without power! And that's why my revenge was necessary! Gayha, Gyahahaha! None of you can catch me! Not Patricia! Not Blaise! .....And not even you!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, at this rate...! Isn't there something, anything, we can do?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even though all my logic points to this man... ...I just need evidence... even a single piece of evidence would suffice!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
...Well. It's been a fun show, but it looks like it's time for the curtains to close. If you'd like, why don't you come and see my next performance? I'll let you, if you admit defeat. ...Gyaha, gyaha, Gyahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Simon:
...Wh-Who was that!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Kay:
Gummy! Where'd you go?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I was just doing the job that I'm able to do, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe...! Your report, please.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I did a quick investigation, sir! About the warehouse John was at!
</line><line>Simon:
......!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That refrigerated warehouse is currently being rented by... ...the <textEffects>Berry Big Circus</textEffects>, just as Mr. Edgeworth said!
</line><line>Lang:
Hahaha! So it's finally here... Our trump card!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well done, Detective Gumshoe. .....Now then, Mr. Keyes?
</line><line>Simon:
Hmph. There must be some mistake. Maybe it has something to do with the circus?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. Indeed, we are not well informed with the affairs of the circus. In that case, why don't we get your boss' opinion on this? ...Regina.
</line><line>Simon:
Ngh.....!
</line><line>Regina:
We are renting a refrigerated warehouse to store the animal's food, but... ...I don't know much about the place. After all... I let Simon handle everything.
</line><line>Simon:
Nnngh! C-Curse yooouuuu!
</line><line>Regina:
Kyaaaah! S-Simon... how scary!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What a shame... It seems your desperate actions after the crime were in vain. If the body was found in the warehouse, suspicion would've fallen on you, the one in charge. That's why you specifically moved the body back to the Grand Tower, wasn't it?
</line><line>Simon:
Ngh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, us finding John confined at the warehouse was a fatal mistake on your part. Our resident <textEffects>Great Thief</textEffects> and <textEffects>Detective</textEffects> are both rather exemplary. What's wrong? I can even tell through your face paint that you're looking pale.
</line><line>Simon:
Keh heh heh... Ahahahaha! It's not over yet, Mr. Edgeworth. Your logic is missing the most important piece of evidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? Please do tell.
</line><line>Simon:
Isn't that obvious!? Evidence that I killed the body double with the balloon! You can't present it, can you? After all, there's no way such evidence could possibly exist!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The evidence..... it exists.
</line><line>Simon:
What'd you say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If Mr. Keyes murdered the victim...)</textEffects> <textEffects>Traces of the murder should still remain here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
It should become clear once we examine the basket of this balloon.
</line><line>Simon:
Gyahaha! The balloon again? Didn't you already find the bullet hole? There's no way you'll find anything else there!
</line><line>Kay:
That's... I-It'll be fine! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Mr. Edgeworth is a hero who always finds the truth no matter what he's up against!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Of course it's gonna be fine! Mr. Edgeworth has gotten out of more impossible situations than I can count!
</line><line>Ray:
Miles, I believe in you too. But more importantly... I'm sure your old man watching over you believes in you as well.
</line><line>Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Calm down and think. You're just one step away from the perfect proof!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The body double was killed by this balloon. The proof lies in the traces left on the basket. ...Simon Keyes. It's time for you to atone for your crimes.
</line><line>Lang:
...I'll see it with my own eyes. The moment this past case is settled once and for all!
</line><line>Courtney:
Please... Prosecutor Edgeworth. Deliver the final blow to this unforgivable person!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the final piece of evidence that proves your crimes! <textEffects>(What traces were left on the balloon that crushed the victim?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
When John found the body... ...a <textEffects>bouquet of Lion Lilies</textEffects> was there as well.
</line><line>Lang:
Lion Lilies? The flowers from Zheng Fa that represent the bond between parent and child...?
</line><line>Simon:
That's your evidence? Surely, they must be buried under a mountain of garbage by now. Moreover, the one who threw it away was John himself. That's not much of a bond now, is it?
</line><line>John:
Grrr... That language of flowers stuff has nothing to do with this!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Calm down, John. Certainly, you may have thrown the flowers away. However, I believe those emotions remain as strong as ever. Those bonds will surely protect you from that man, in the form of my final piece of evidence...
</line><line>Simon:
What..... the heck are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Those flowers were crushed... Ergo, they must have come into contact with the murder weapon! Perhaps we'll find the <textEffects>very same pollen</textEffects> still stuck to the basket of your balloon?
</line><line>Simon:
Nowaynowaynoway! You guys examined the basket just a few moments ago. If there had been any yellow pollen stuck on there, wouldn't you have noticed it then?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Keyes. Evidence is not restricted to what you can see with the naked eye.
</line><line>Simon:
What...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ema!
</line><line>Ema:
Yes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Would you perform one more scientific investigation for us?
</line><line>Ema:
Leave it to me! The balloon's basket, right!? Ah! A reaction! This is clearly pollen from a yellow flower! We'll find out soon enough whether or not it's from the same flower!
</line><line>Simon:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAT!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'd say this proves that... ...the body double's death was caused directly by your own hand!
</line><line>Simon:
No way! That's...! That can't be! I...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You crushed the body double to death on the roof of the tower! Then, you retrieved the body and hid it in the warehouse.
</line><line>Lang:
Why... did he have to go to the trouble of retrieving the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Two nights ago, he knew, that a separate incident would occur at the tower.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! Ms. Crane's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Precisely. Leaving the body there would have disrupted his plans.
</line><line>Lang:
I see. But even so, he couldn't leave the body in the circus warehouse either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Exactly. So the next day, when he was bringing the body back to the tower once again... ...he saw the small fire John started, which caused the Moozilla's head to fall! Was that when the idea came to you? Your plan to pin the crime on John.
</line><line>Simon:
Gaaaaah...!
</line><line>Courtney:
You made it look like the murder weapon was the fallen head. Such foul, cowardly behavior...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For that reason, you carried the double's body in the balloon and lowered it into the film lot. At that time, the figure of the body double being lowered down by a rope... ...was captured in John's video recording!
</line><line>Simon:
D-Damn... I-It was all... You saw through it all!? Damn it... DAMN YOUUU!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You manipulated animals, you manipulated people, and you manipulated cases... ...almost as if you were a king. However, it's now all come to an end...
</line><line>Regina:
Simon. The animals have gotten angry. Even Money and Astique. You never thought of them as your friends at all... How sad.
</line><line>Simon:
D-Damn it! Don't you look at me with those eyes!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. It's about time you went back to being a mere clown. A fitting end to your... pitiful jester's act.
</line><line>Simon:
U... Uwah... S-Stay away! Get away from meeeeeee! Stop it! Please stop it...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
"<textEffects>Daddy...! Help me! I'm scared... I'm so scared...!</textEffects>"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
I don't know anything! I didn't do anything bad! They were the bad ones, weren't they!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
"<textEffects>Horace... Why? Why did you stop me...?</textEffects>"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
If he hadn't done that, I......! I couldn't even trust the police! Nobody would help me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
"<textEffects>But that man...! Back then, he saved me...!</textEffects>"
</line>
<hr />
<line>Simon:
The only one who helped me was Dogen! So, I used everyone else! What's wrong with that!? S-Stop it! Don't come any closer! STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! OWIE! OWIE! OWIE! AIIIEEEE! HYAAARGH! U... Uuugh... N-Not you...! UGHYAAAHIIIIIII! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA P-Please..... NO MOOOOOOOOORE!
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
It seems the game is finally over.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Shelly de Killer!
</line><line>de Killer:
Mr. Edgeworth. I must thank you. You have exposed the true identity of the <textEffects>mastermind</textEffects>. Now... I am free to...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>de Killer:
...Drawing a gun would be most inadvisable. Stay where you are and do not move.
</line><line>Simon:
Ngh... I-I don't have a gun...
</line><line>de Killer:
You do have a gun, do you not? You intended to draw and fire it without anyone noticing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He must have taken it from the body double when he killed him...)</textEffects>
</line><line>de Killer:
This man has betrayed his bond of trust with me. He would have me kill the president, while knowing full well he was the body double. Lying about a target is an extremely dangerous thing to do to an assassin. Not having all the cards on the table can seriously jeopardize an assassination.
</line><line>Simon:
Uuggghh!
</line><line>de Killer:
However, what is even more unforgivable... ...is your deception and your attempt to manipulate me. The time has come... for your retribution.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Stop!
</line><line>de Killer:
Y-You are...!
</line><line>Dogen:
It has been far too long, Shelly.
</line><line>de Killer:
Please step aside. That man is my prey.
</line><line>Dogen:
I must ask you to spare his life. Please permit this young acolyte to receive his proper punishment in prison.
</line><line>de Killer:
........
</line><line>Simon:
........
</line><line>de Killer:
And if I refuse?
</line><line>Dogen:
His is the first life I have ever saved... I will not allow it to be taken away so easily.
</line><line>de Killer:
You saved a life...? The assassin, Sirhan Dogen?
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. Ironic, is it not? That I, the one who has taken countless lives, am making a plea for this young one's life. He saved my life, just as I have saved his. Before I knew it, I grew quite fond of the lad. You may laugh at me as much as you wish. However... I must ask that you spare the life of the boy. From one assassin to another... Please make this allowance.
</line><line>de Killer:
........ ...I understand. If you are willing to go that far...
</line><line>Dogen:
You have my thanks. I am in your debt.
</line><line>de Killer:
......No need for thanks. I simply felt there would be no merit in a fight to the death with you. That is all. And with that, I must take my leave.
</line><line>Lang:
Damn it! Wait!
</line><line>Dogen:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I must thank you as well. It was necessary for this young acolyte to be put in his place. And that, you have done. ......Now then, it's time for me to return. To my humble cage, surrounded by iron bars. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Dogen:
......Oh? Look who's here...
</line><line>John:
...Hey, priest guy. You killed my dad, right?
</line><line>Dogen:
...Indeed. I am not one to forget those I have slain. Keh heh heh... I see. You must despise me, boy with horns. In that case...
</line><line>John:
.....Ugh!
</line><line>Courtney:
J-John!
</line><line>Dogen:
Do not panic. I simply lent the boy with horns my knife. Take that knife... And run it through my throat! A single stab should do it. I've long grown weary of my wooden carvings. Keh heh heh.
</line><line>John:
.......Revenge...
</line><line>Kay:
J-John! Don't do it!
</line><line>Courtney:
John... Please, I beg of you!
</line><line>John:
...Until just now, I had intended to seek revenge... no matter how many years it took.
</line><line>Simon:
Revenge...? Revenge is good, really good. ...All your pain and suffering slips away. Everything becomes numb, and you'll feel nothing.
</line><line>John:
Yeah, you may be right. I thought about that while I listened to what you had to say.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...John!
</line><line>John:
But, the only one who would be satisfied with revenge would be myself, right? If I became a murderer, my mom would go through even more pain and suffering. My friends from the movie too, and all those people who care about me as well...
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. The boy with horns... says some interesting things.
</line><line>John:
That's right. I finally get it now. I'll never forgive you, but... I'm not the one who should punish you. After all, isn't that what my mom... and that prosecutor guy are here for?
</line><line>Courtney:
John...!
</line><line>Kay:
John... you just said some really profound stuff just now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Kay, perhaps you should study up a little more yourself...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
Is that so? ...Well then, young one. It is time for us to depart.
</line><line>Simon:
Wh-Where to?
</line><line>Dogen:
To prison, of course. That place will be our home.
</line><line>Simon:
Our home...?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
And with that... the case that involved and affected so many people came to a close. However, there was still one last thing I had to do...
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>April 8, 2:54 PMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room</textEffects></center>
<line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting!
</line><line>Ray:
Why'd you call Uncle Ray and the rest of us out here?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
..........
</line><line>Courtney:
Mr. Edgeworth. The formal proceedings have just come to a close.
</line><line>Ray:
Hm? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is the place where I once relinquished my <textEffects>prosecutor's badge</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
In order to save me when I was suffering from memory loss, you...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......A certain man once said... ...the only ally a defendant has is their attorney. By trusting in their client, an attorney draws closer to the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>... The sight of that man still shines brilliantly in my eyes... ...just as the image of my father fighting in court does.
</line><line>Ray:
...Gregory...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, this is nothing more than that man and my father's way of life. ......It is not mine.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I think I shall live as a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects> after all.
</line><line>Ray:
.........I see. So, you've made your decision.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry...
</line><line>Ray:
No, no, I understand... That's your answer, isn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is.
</line><line>Ray:
OK! Then that's the end of this conversation! Don't regret it. Even if you beg me later, I won't let you work for me ever again!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I-I understand.
</line><line>Ray:
But you know, Miles... Mind if I ask why you chose to live as a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
.......... Mr. Shields. You asked me this before...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I've thought long and hard about that question ever since. How should I live my life...? ...And after this case concluded, I finally found my answer. I want to save people as a prosecutor.
</line><line>Ray:
As a prosecutor...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes... He, too, was a <textEffects>victim</textEffects>. He lost a parent in a past murder, and with it, the ability to believe in anything else. <textEffects>(I, too, know that feeling... The feeling of losing what's important to you and being unable to believe in anything. I doubted everything during my lonely battles in those days.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"!</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The one who saved me was...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes must have been all alone... Unable to find salvation from the law, he had no choice but to turn his hand to revenge.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
</line><line>Simon:
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I want to save those like Simon Keyes.
</line><line>Ray:
So, how would you save him?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure this tragedy could have been avoided if only he could have relied on the courts.
</line><line>Courtney:
But instead, he was cornered by Blaise Debeste, who used the power of law for evil. The form of the <textEffects>law</textEffects> can change depending on who wields it. It can be at once a shield to protect... and a blade to harm. That, too, is a <textEffects>contradiction of the law</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ray:
A contradiction, huh...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
That's true... It sure is a <textEffects>contradiction in the law</textEffects>. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
The only way to right those contradictions is by joining in the court system... The one who could save Simon Keyes was not an attorney... ...but rather a watchman of the law: a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>. I shall face the contradictions in the law as a prosecutor.
</line><line>Ray:
.......... I see. That's just like you. But you know... It'll be tough. It won't be just a walk in the park. You'll be going up against the <textEffects>law</textEffects> itself... You do realize that, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I do. However, someone must.
</line><line>Ray:
.....Yup, yup. Uncle Ray believes in you too. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. I'm sure you can pull it off. After all, you're Gregory's son. Your old man would never give up, no matter what. His eyes always saw only what laid straight ahead. Miles... When you chose to live as a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>, your eyes looked just like your father's. It looks like you've grown a bit. I really wish your old man could see you now...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thank you very much, Mr. Shields.
</line><line>Courtney:
...So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Allow me to formally return this to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Please do.
</line><line>Courtney:
I, Justine Courtney, as a member of the P.I.C, do hereby return to Miles Edgeworth... ...the rights and privileges of a prosecutor, in the name of the Goddess of Law...!
</line><line><textEffects>Prosecutor's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
And with that, Prosecutor Edgeworth is revived!
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Gumshoe:
That's great, sir!
</line><line>Ray:
So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, it's time for Uncle Ray to make his exit. I have to report to your old man all about the traitor in the Edgeworth family.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Thank you for everything, truly.
</line><line>Ray:
The next time we meet just might be in the courtroom. I hope you'll be ready. ...Uncle Ray might not look it, but he's an ace attorney, after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll look forward to seeing the attorney my father trained in action.
</line><line>Ray:
Take care!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... Welcome back.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. I must give my thanks to you as well.
</line><line>Courtney:
To me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You sought to fix the corruption within the P.I.C. from the inside. That must truly have been a lonely battle.
</line><line>Courtney:
No, it was not... for I was never alone.
</line><line>Kay:
Because the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects> is always by your side, right!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You made me realize that one could fight in such a way. The Prosecutor's Office, no, the entire legal world is caught up in this contradiction. If that cannot be set right, there is a <textEffects>truth</textEffects> that will never see the light of day... It was only through your help that I was able to find this new path. One that fights against the <textEffects>contradictions in the law</textEffects>.
</line><line>Courtney:
I, too, find that promising, as one in the service of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. You shall certainly succeed in helping the <textEffects>law</textEffects> grow.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let us meet again in the courtroom.
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. I must apologize for my shameful acts during the trial two days ago... Next time, I shall fulfill my duties as a judge perfectly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor...... I do not intend to speak regarding your ideals.
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, the <textEffects>greatest judge</textEffects> I know... ...is one overflowing with humanity. Even during a trial, that judge experiences happiness, anger, sadness, and joy... ...but nevertheless, always hands down the correct verdict in the end.
</line><line>Courtney:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's difficult to say... ...but sometimes, I feel that... ...perfection is not always correct.
</line><line>Courtney:
So, a judge, too has the right to behave in such a manner... ...Thank you very much. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects> was not the only one by my side.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! It's John!
</line><line>Courtney:
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. No matter how painful things became, no matter how strong the foe... ...when I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward. Wrongs must be put right. For John's sake, as well...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(John, too, lost his father in a past crime...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
That is more important to me than even the words of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. Ha ha. Though I'm sure the <textEffects>Goddess</textEffects> would be angered by those words.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.
</line><line>Courtney:
I don't have to be perfect, I just want to grow little by little. Both as a judge, and as a mother. ...That is how I feel.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. It seems there is much each of us has yet to learn.
</line><line>Courtney:
Agreed. We are still but children before the world. Let us grow in our respective paths, until we meet again. I shall look forward to that reunion... May the blessings of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects> be upon you as you follow your new path!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Though I once lost my position as <textEffects>Prosecutor</textEffects>, I have now reclaimed it... ...so that I may tread a new path as a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>. I shall surely reach the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> waiting at the end of this path. No matter how difficult the path may be... ...if any seek to stop me on my path, they shall receive no mercy. No matter who they may be, I will shout just one word.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Are you inquiring into my studies to become a pet groomer? I am working as hard as ever. I spend every day covered in mud...

Because I was Warden Roland's accomplice? Oo... ooo... oooh. UOOOOOOOOH! Why do you think I've been giving a rat's ass about these stupid animals' well being!? To hell with the pet trimmer's license!

<line>Dogen:
It seems I have grown soft in my old age. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? To think the life I saved on a whim 18 years ago would drive me to such lengths.

He chose not to take the same path as Gregory, but rather, to live as a prosecutor. Well, I am kinda sad that I won't get to work with him, but I'll continue to watch over him.
</line><line>Badd:
Heh... It looks like you've grown up quite a bit yourself.

</line><line>John:
...Y-Yeah, I guess. Well, it would be nice if there's a sequel. I really enjoy working as an actor. ...Mom, before we head home, can we go buy something? I'd like to decorate our home with a Lion Lily, for dad.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed, we were. Why did all these incidents happen in such quick succession?
</line><line>Kay:
I feel like things are always busy whenever I'm around!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wait, Kay, wouldn't that mean you're a magnet for crimes...?
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! Gummy, that was rude.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I do get the impression that he's not entirely wrong...)</textEffects> So then, Kay, do you intend to resume your training to become a Great Thief?
</line><line>Kay:
Hmm. I dunno...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? Is something on your mind, pal?
</line><line>Kay:
How should I put it...? Until now, I've always been chasing after my father... ...so that I could become a Great Thief, just like him!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Like the previous <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</textEffects>, I suppose...)</span>
</line><line>Kay:
But... watching you, Mr. Edgeworth, made me think. Maybe, instead of chasing after my father, I should find my own path. ...I mean, you didn't become a defense attorney either.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Chasing after a parent's shadow isn't the only path in life for a child, after all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
I'm going to aim to be a <textEffects>hero</textEffects> in my own way!

...That sounds good.

</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh?
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
......D-Does that mean... what I think it means...!?

R-Really, sir!? I can't believe it!
</line><line>Kay:
Isn't that great, Gummy!?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's like a dream come true! I can finally say goodbye to my instant noodle lifestyle!

However, that doesn't mean you can start slacking off. The real work begins from here on out. ...You should prepare yourself.

<line>Edgeworth:
The path Mr. Shields and Judge Courtney taught me... ...is to take a stand against the <textEffects>contradiction in the law</textEffects>... ...and to reach the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> at the end of that road. <textEffects>(What am I able to do? That is a question I must continue to dwell upon. Certainly, this path will not be easy. However...)</textEffects>

<line>Courtney:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects> was not the only one by my side.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! It's John!
</line><line>Courtney:
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. When I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Bonds... huh.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Ahh! I completely forgot!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Th-That was sudden. What's wrong?
</line><line>Kay:
I was searching for members for the new <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects> team!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now that you mention it, I do remember you saying something to that effect...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
But in the end, I wasn't even able to find a single person. Can you imagine it? A team, combining their powers, in order to steal the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>! I wanted to create an invincible team like that, but...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What are you saying, pal!? Don't you already have a team!? Together, the three of us can solve any case that comes our way!
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah! You're right! A prosecutor, a detective, and a Great Thief! We're the invincible trio of heroes that steals, captures, and pursues the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hearing all that kind of makes me feel sorry for the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
As long as the three of us are together, there's nothing to fear! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, you are correct...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Even until his last moments, my father ran along his own path. I, too, shall advance along mine... ...accompanied by my somewhat boisterous comrades. As long as they are by my side, I can walk forward without hesitation... ...on this new path as a <textEffects>prosecutor</textEffects>. <textEffects>Prosecutors</textEffects> and <textEffects>attorneys</textEffects>... The path I walk is not my father's. However, I am certain that the two paths are not separate. Though we may walk in opposite directions, our destination is the same. Why, you may ask...? Because both paths lead to the one and only <textEffects>Truth</textEffects>.
