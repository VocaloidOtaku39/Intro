</line><line>Phoenix:
Two years ago, the defendant was a detective at the Police Department, correct?
</line><line>Ema:
Yes. She was second in command under Chief Detective Gant. My sister... She was the best detective ever!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, I remember. Chief Detective Gant and Ms. Skye used to be quite the pair.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I believe they shared the same office.
</line><line>Ema:
That's right. I'd always sit at my sister's desk, and dream about playing that organ. I wanted to play it that day, too...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office held a ceremony that day.
</line><line>Ema:
Lana promised to take me to dinner after she finished her work.

<textEffects>A man came running in, and took me hostage.</textEffects>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>Neil Marshall rescued me,</textEffects>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago.
</line><line>Ema:
Yes. That's what's so scary about this trial.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And you told Detective Goodman about what you saw?
</line><line>Ema:
Yes, but... at the time, the words just wouldn't come out. That's why I drew a picture.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A picture... Yes, I think she mentioned that before.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Have you heard enough?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The picture the witness drew... I believe it has a very important meaning.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
But the list of evidence I was given two years ago didn't contain a picture...
</line><line>Judge:
Witness. Would you mind if we added this statement to your testimony?
</line><line>Ema:
Y-yes, Your Honor.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ema doesn't have any reason to lie... but Lana sure does. I need to get Ema to tell me as much about this as she can!)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. This little girl put all her heart into drawing that picture... and yet you still insist on denying its existence?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Huh!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy! All I'm saying is that as the prosecutor for that case, I wasn't handed such a picture!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That may well be... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Behold!
</line><line>Judge:
This is... the evidence list for the SL-9 Incident?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please turn it over, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Turn it over...? Turn... it... AAAAAAAHHHH! What's this!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, what is that?
</line><line>Ema:
Hey! That's it! That's the picture I drew!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... Two men appear to be wrestling here.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What's the meaning of this!? What are you doing with that list!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Only the prosecutor in charge should have access to that list!
</line><line>Judge:
Huh...? These lists... They're... They're different from each other.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?
</line><line>Judge:
It would appear, Mr. Edgeworth, that the evidence list you were handed two years ago... was <textEffects>incomplete</textEffects>. These two lists... fit together to form one. You can see the marks here, where they were torn apart from each other.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you see, Mr. Edgeworth. It's quite obvious what happened. Two years ago... only half of the evidence in that case ever reached you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What... WWWHHAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!????
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Who'd have thought the picture would have been drawn on the back of the list...
</line><line>Ema:
That was handed to Detective Goodman in the questioning room?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait a minute... If this list was torn in half, then that means...)</textEffects> Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Are you all right, Mr. Wright? Your eyes are bulging from your head...
</line><line>Phoenix:
If the evidence list was torn in half... then there might be more of the drawing on the back of Mr. Edgeworth's list!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, that's quite conceivable. Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's possible. Let's see... MM! MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Is something wrong?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do you even have to ask?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, Your Honor. There is something drawn on the back of my list. This is that... thing!
</line><line>Judge:
... That's that... that thing! That thing that was dancing in the evidence room!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Apparently the Head of Criminal Affairs used this for his blueprint.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess he was out of scrap paper...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
...
</line><line><textEffects>The Evidence List has been updated.</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Witness. Will you please testify about this picture you drew two years ago?
</line><line>Ema:
...Huh? Oh, Y-yes sir, Your Honor!

<line>Ema:
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
After that I must have fainted.
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
To think a flash of lightning could burn such an image in your mind...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Thanks to that though, she was able to show us exactly what she saw!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I don't see any contradictions here. This clearly shows Joe Darke about to murder Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Judge:
The defense may now begin its cross-examination.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's strange... She claims this is exactly the scene that was imprinted in her mind... And yet... There's clearly a contradiction here!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew... contains a blatant contradiction!
</line><line>Ema:
What? B-but, I still remember it just like it was yesterday!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps it would be faster if you simply pointed out this contradiction for us. <textEffects>What part of this picture... contradicts the autopsy report?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The contradiction of course lies here! Take a look at the knife the man is holding. If you look closely, you can see its tip is broken!
</line><line>Judge:
In fact, you don't even have to look closely to see that.
</line><line>Ema:
But Mr. Wright, look at the evidence! See the murder weapon? Its tip is broken too!
</line><line>Judge:
If I recall... the tip of the knife was found broken off in the victim's body.
</line><line>Ema:
It was the conclusive piece of evidence that proved Joe Darke was the murderer!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid it's not so simple, Ema.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Huh? Where could you possibly see a problem!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's obvious, really. The victim "<textEffects>suffered a single stab wound in the back</textEffects>." If the victim was only stabbed once, then the murder weapon should not yet be broken!
</line><line>Judge:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH! What's the meaning of this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps the knife was broken beforehand!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not possible. The tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body. If it was broken beforehand, it couldn't possibly wind up there!
</line><line>Judge:
That's right! But what does this mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The tip of the knife was undeniably discovered within the victim's body! The only possible explanation is the witness's memory is mistaken!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's why I asked her so many times if she was sure she remembered correctly. I believe you were annoyed at the time. But she was sure she remembered correctly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But... there's no other way to explain this inconsistency!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth. There is another explanation. Have you forgotten already? About a little something called... "<textEffects>falsified evidence</textEffects>"?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're treading on thin ice, Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
All I'm saying, is that this broken knife might be the piece of evidence that was forged! You can't deny the possibility!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... Aaaaaagh!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Are you saying the investigation really was corrupted?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a <textEffects>lie</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Ema:I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... If that's true... then there's no other way around it. This could not have been the actual murder weapon.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There must have been <textEffects>another broken knife</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What are the chances of there being two broken knives?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">Another broken knife</textEffects> besides Joe Darke's... Could there have been one?)</span>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw... it can't just be explained away by a simple observational error.
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
In that instant... Ema really did see a broken knife!
</line><line>Judge:
I assume then, that you have some information about this "other" broken knife? If so, please feel free to enlighten us.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder... There's only one way!)</textEffects> Take a look at this. Here's <textEffects>the real murder weapon</textEffects>!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past. Right here inside this picture!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is a picture of the awards ceremony. A-AAAAHH!
</line><line>Judge:
What is it, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's the... the broken murder weapon!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Notice the award Prosecutor Marshall is holding.
</line><line>Ema:
That's... <textEffects>a broken knife</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
As we earlier concluded, the knife in the picture was not Joe Darke's knife. That being the case... the knife the witness saw, was in all likelihood this award!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Neil Marshall was awarded King of Prosecutors that day. As an award, he was given this broken shield and a broken knife. When he chased after Joe Darke, he pulled out this knife. Being a prosecutor, he did not carry a pistol. This broken knife was the only weapon he had in this dangerous situation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But that... That can't be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? And why not, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Because if the King of Prosecutors award knife was the murder weapon... then the murderer and the victim would be <textEffects>reversed</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I mean... This man raising a knife... would have been Prosecutor <textEffects>Neil Marshall</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh... OOOOOHHHHH!!!
</line><line>Judge:
But the prosecutor was the one who actually died!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's true... <textEffects>(What's going on here?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has been a bit too eager to jump to conclusions...

</line><line>Ema:
Wait! I... I remember now... I remember everything!
</line><line>Judge:
Witness...?
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What is it?
</line><line>Ema:
Could you show me your <textEffects>evidence list</textEffects> again, please?
</line><line>Judge:
His list? The one with that... picture scribbled on the back?
</line><line>Ema:
... I knew it... This picture... I'm the one who drew it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You drew that?
</line><line>Ema:
That's right. The list wasn't torn in half at the time I drew this picture. All this time I've been trying so hard to forget... I must have locked this part away deep inside me...
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps it would be best... if we added this to the witness's testimony. Would you please tell us what you've recalled, Ms. Skye?
</line><line>Ema:
Yes, Your Honor.

Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!

Lana!

</line><line>Lana:
But you can't do this! I've already confessed to the crime! Why can't you just leave it at that!?

Chief Prosecutor Skye.
</line><line>Lana:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We've already come this far. It's too late to turn back.

Silence! The defense will now begin its cross-examination. Bailiff. Please detain the defendant.

It is the defense's belief that on that fateful day two years ago... there indeed was something that looked similar to the Blue Badger... Something that is now sitting in this very room!
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright...!
</line><line>Judge:
In this room? Very well, Mr. Wright. What is it that the witness saw in that instant? Please show us this mysterious "Blue Badger" look-alike!

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The Blue Badger didn't even exist two years ago... So what exactly did Ema see? I've gathered all the evidence. All that's left now... is to put the pieces of the puzzle together...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!
</line><line>Judge:
But that's... Er, what exactly is that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe it's some sort of jar.
</line><line>Ema:
But Mr. Wright! That doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Indeed it doesn't. As it stands now, it's just a plain jar. However... What if we were to change our viewpoint?
</line><line>Judge:
Our viewpoint...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Well...? Is this a miracle or what? No one can possibly deny this jar's resemblance to the Blue Badger!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... It can't be!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has proven its claim. The mysterious "Blue Badger" witnessed on the day of the crime was actually this...
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Although we all enjoyed Mr. Wright's dramatic performance, one question remains... What's your point!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So that Badger thing was actually just a jar. That doesn't change anything!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's where you're wrong, Mr. Edgeworth. You see... this changes everything!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed? Very well, then. Please tell us... What's different now that we know the witness saw this jar?
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Allow me to take these in turn. At the moment of the murder, the witness saw this jar.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not only that, but she saw it at a very specific angle.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Knowing this, where could she have seen this jar?
</line><line>Judge:
Where...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But the body was found lying near Lana Skye's desk! The witness testified so herself!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in <textEffects>Chief Gant's office</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you implying the murderer moved the victim's body? From Damon Gant's office to Lana Skye's office?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why would he do that!? There's no reason!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Phoenix:
If there wasn't a "reason"... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a "<textEffects>reason</textEffects>."
</line><line>Judge:
Do you know what that reason was, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.)</textEffects> Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?
</line><line>Judge:
That would have to have been... the impact the man made when he was knocked into the wall?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
</line><line>Ema:
A-AHHHHHH...
</line><line>Judge:
The suit of <textEffects>armor</textEffects>! Holding... a very sharp and dangerous-looking sword...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a <textEffects>broken knife</textEffects>... he would have had to have been <textEffects>Neil Marshall</textEffects>, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No... Mr. Wright... You can't be thinking...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. There is <textEffects>another possibility</textEffects> of what actually transpired in that room.
</line><line>Judge:
Another possibility?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... <textEffects>(I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright? What's the matter?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If events took place as the defense theorizes... Then the outcome is obvious. In that moment... assuming the man Ema Skye knocked away was actually <textEffects>Prosecutor Neil Marshall</textEffects>...
</line><line>Ema:
You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>*thud*
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I never imagined her testimony would lead to this...
</line><line>Judge:
So it was the witness who took the victim's life... and then proved so with her own testimony! This is unprecedented!
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lana:
What... What are you saying!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances...
</line><line>Lana:
Joe Darke murdered Prosecutor Marshall! How can you think it was Ema!? How dare you try to pin the crime on her!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Imagine that, coming from you.
</line><line>Lana:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you recall, it was you who admitted to forging evidence two years ago. The reason you moved Prosecutor Marshall's body... was to keep anyone else from finding out about what Ema did, wasn't it?
</line><line>Lana:
I assure you, Mr. Edgeworth, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you hope to have anyone believe your insane allegations, I'm afraid you're going to have to have proof. Tell me... Do you have any conclusive evidence that proves my sister killed Neil Marshall?
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-evidence?
</line><line>Lana:
I'm willing to bet you don't.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... it certainly would be difficult to prove this with evidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If we don't have evidence, then we'll have to rely on testimony.
</line><line>Lana:
I'm afraid that won't work in this case. Both parties involved in the incident are dead.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Touche, Ms. Skye. Of course... That only leaves us with one possibility.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(You mean, there's still another possibility?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I mean, the possibility that <textEffects>the victim left us a message</textEffects>. For better or for worse, Mr. Marshall did not die instantly. He may have left behind the name of the person who took his life... somehow.
</line><line>Lana:
That's... That's impossible!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? This is the only possibility left to you. A <textEffects>message from the deceased</textEffects>... Does such a message exist?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I've got to think back to the Court Record!)</textEffects> The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession.
</line><line>Lana:
Mr. Wright! Will you stop at nothing to prove my sister a murderer?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do not be mistaken, Ms. Skye.
</line><line>Lana:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Our purpose is not to accuse Ema of any crime. There is only one thing we seek: the truth. No matter how painful it may be.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please show us the piece of evidence... that conveys a message from the deceased!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is the message left by the deceased.
</line><line>Judge:
This is that "Blue Badger" from before, right?
</line><line>Lana:
Oh, is he going to just speak the killer's name?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If that thing could, I'm sure it would.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Looks like everyone's forgotten this is just a jar.)</textEffects> A message was left here... on the surface of this jar.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you look closely, you can see a faint trail of blood on this jar.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It looks like someone wiped the blood away.
</line><line>Lana:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, but notice: for some reason... the blood on some of the fragments was not wiped away.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... there is a line here... drawn in blood!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So what you're saying, is these "<textEffects>dots</textEffects>"... were once <textEffects>lines</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Prosecutor Marshall did not die instantly. He used the few precious moments left to him to leave behind a message!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
One that someone apparently wiped away... But blood must have seeped into the jar where the lines change directions.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Precisely so! All we need to do is connect these points... and the victim's message will become apparent!
</line><line>Lana:
N-no...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor... I believe these blood stains will reveal to us the answer! <textEffects>(I've got to connect these dots to make letters. There's only one thing the victim would have written, given the circumstances: <span style="color:#E16935">The murderer's name</textEffects>!)</span>
&#160;
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence. That's why all I've been thinking about is saving Lana. After all my efforts, I never thought it would turn out like this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>"<textEffects>Ema</textEffects>"...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So this is the final message Prosecutor Marshall left behind.
</line><line>Judge:
Of all people... She may not have meant it... but in the end, the one who took the victim's life...
</line><line>Phoenix:
was Ema Skye.
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
See, Worthy? Can't say I didn't warn you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Chief Gant...
</line><line>Gant:
Do you understand the implications of what you've done?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What...? What are you talking about?
</line><line>Gant:
Two years ago, Joe Darke was sentenced to death. He was convicted because of his final murder. I believe you were the prosecutor in the case, were you not?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ack!
</line><line>Gant:
Yes, Worthy. Because of you... an innocent man was sentenced to death. Not only that... but you used forged evidence to ensure his conviction!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
K-kkckck! KKCKRRAAAAHHHH!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
</line><line>Gant:
I'm afraid that's not important. Didn't you know? We aren't defenders of justice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Gant:
We're merely keepers of the law. Sentencing a man to death... is no light matter. Even if there wasn't any cover-up or evidence forgery... ultimately the responsibility falls on the prosecutor in charge.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Gant:
Despite what anyone may say, this fact cannot be denied.
</line><line>What's going on at the Prosecutor's Office!?They might have sent an innocent man to his death!How can he just stand there, like it wasn't his fault!?
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDEEEEERRRRRR!!!

</line><line>Phoenix:

You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I take it Lana's having you run errands again.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Let me tell you, this is the last time, pal! Here. She asked me to give this to you if there was a break in today's trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Evidence Law"? <textEffects>(Edgeworth was talking about this just the other day...)</textEffects>

I'm sure you know the two rules of evidence law, don't you Wright? Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!

</line><line>Phoenix:
It seems so.
</line><line>Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
The Chief Prosecutor also wanted me to give you a message.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A message?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
She said, "If you're planning to take HIM on, you're going to need this book."

That's where you're wrong, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Haven't you figured it out yet? Why I'm still sitting in that prosecutor's seat... despite all these allegations being thrown at me?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The real trial today... hasn't begun yet.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What!? What else is there left to do? Your credibility's been all but ruined with this forged evidence you were unaware of, Ema Skye found out she unwittingly caused a man's death... And now you're telling me you want to do more!? You've gotta be kidding me, pal!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She merely stuck a knife into his dead body. That means the real killer...is still out there.

The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye. Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
The inquiry committee is planning to impose harsh penalties for your actions.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Thank you for the news, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well... *a-hem* Normally, this is where the prosecution calls forth a witness... but, er... *a-hem* *cough* *cough* This isn't easy to say... You see, there is some concern that Mr. Edgeworth may have, ah...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Struck a bargain?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You think I may have manipulated the witnesses.
</line><line>Judge:
I didn't say that! It's just, you see... Everyone has been talking, and...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Very well, Your Honor. I have a solution.
</line><line>Judge:
A solution?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That being the case, the prosecution will allow the defense to call forth all further witnesses.
</line><line>Judge:
What!? But there's never been a case example...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Undeniably this is an unusual arrangement... but a very effective one. It would prove that I haven't struck any "deals" with the witnesses.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you say?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Unbelievable. Edgeworth has found a way to continue the trial!)</textEffects> Very well. The defense accepts the prosecution's proposal.

Then it's settled. The, uh... defense... may now call forth the next witness!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!

You do realize this is your last chance? If you call the wrong witness... this trial is as good as over.

The defense calls... <textEffects>(The time's finally come to bring out the real murderer!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!
</line><line>Judge:
D-Damon Gant...? What does he have to do with anything!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... As the defendant's partner two years ago, Mr. Gant has first-hand knowledge of the crime. I feel we should hear what he has to say about it.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As luck would have it, he should still be in the courthouse. He would also be the least likely to have been manipulated by me in any way. Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
True... All right. Bailiff! Please escort Mr. Gant to the stand!

Now then, Chief Gant. The court requests to hear your testimony.
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, Wrighto. What's with the grim face?
</line><line>Phoenix:
First, let's clear up this SL-9 Incident.
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, you mean that time when Lana's sister murdered that prosecutor? Personally, I think it's been made pretty clear already.
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are still some things unaccounted for.
</line><line>Gant:
Oh? Like what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Like the role you played in all of this.
</line><line>Gant:
... Son... Either you're very brave... or very foolish.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Gant:
You are aware of course that a police chief has all kinds of weapons at his disposal?
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Weapons"...?
</line><line>Gant:
Sure. Take my testimony, for example. I don't have to give it if I don't want to.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? Is that true?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid so... The Chief of Police has the right to refuse to testify.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course, such an action carries with it certain risks...
</line><line>Gant:
... Don't worry. I'm not here to hinder your trial. Just remember... If this turns out to be a big waste of time, don't say I didn't warn you.

<line>Gant:
<textEffects>When I went to my office, I found Lana there.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gant:
<textEffects>Apparently she had already... "arranged" the crime scene.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Gant:
<textEffects>As you can see, I had nothing to do with the "forgery."</textEffects>
</line>




<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Lana did admit to forging evidence... but that can't be the whole truth. Somehow I've got to link Gant to the incident!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It was found where!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You see, Chief Gant. These articles of evidence uncovered in your office... are both concrete proof... that you also played a part in the illegal investigation!
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Gant! What's the meaning of this!?
</line><line>Gant:
Ho! Here's a defense attorney who may even rival Worthy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you admit to it, then? That you were involved in the forgery?
</line><line>Gant:
Who, me? Or do you mean... you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me? Why would I have anything to do with that!?
</line><line>Gant:
Well... You were the one who snuck into my office when you "found" this evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Gant:
Prosecutors aren't the only ones capable of forging evidence, you know. Defense attorneys can do so too. Isn't that right, Wrighto?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
However! Detective Gumshoe was present during the investigation!
</line><line>Gant:
Worthy, my boy. Not even detectives are exempt from the law. Rest assured Dick will receive his due punishment.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAAT!? <textEffects>(If Detective Gumshoe's salary drops any further, he'll end up paying to work!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well. In light of the Detective's presence... please give us your testimony regarding these pieces of evidence found in your office, and their relation to the forgery that took place at the crime scene.

Let's see, what was it now? A jar fragment... and a list?
For all I know, you could have planted them in my office.
Anyway, you can't prove "when" those pieces of evidence were discovered.
If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless.
There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.

<line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
When investigating the crime scene... you should have been more careful to observe protocol.
</line><line>Gant:
You do understand that I am the Chief of Police, right? There will be consequences...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ooh...
</line><line>Gant:
Indeed, I believe I will press charges... so you won't make the same mistake again.
</line><line>Judge:
My apologies, Chief, but would you mind waiting until tomorrow for that? Today is... well, you know...

All right, Udgey. In return, though...

Mr. Wright. It appears you're positively determined to portray the Chief... as a nice man who likes to lend people a hand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That's not what I mean...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, I'll ask. Who is this person you believe Chief Gant may have helped forge evidence?
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gant isn't the one who murdered Prosecutor Marshall two years ago. Yet I know he played a part in the forgery. That can only mean someone asked him to be an accomplice.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Damon Gant... someone's accomplice? That sounds unlikely...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self profit.
</line><line>Judge:
Self profit...? What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant.
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Judge:
B-but... how would he profit from all of this?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet! Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!
</line><line>Judge:
Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!? Oh, wait. You must mean "puppet" as in someone forced to do his bidding... Never mind!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!
</line><line>Gant:
Wrighto, my boy. You have quite an imagination. Let me ask you something.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Gant:
Do you have any proof of this? That I "controlled" Lana? For example, is Lana testifying that I've done such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Lana... <textEffects>(She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid without any proof, this all amounts to nothing more than mere conjecture.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Unless... that is also what happened in this incident...
</line><line>Judge:
"This" incident...? Er... which one would that be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course I'm talking about... the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. The Chief Prosecutor has been acting strange throughout this entire trial. Almost as if... someone has been "controlling" her!
</line><line>Gant:
Worthy... You'd better watch your tongue... I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
</line><line>Judge:
Just what do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!
</line><line>Judge:
Wha... wha... wha... WWWHHHHAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!? Order! Order! Order! I SAID... ORDEEEEERRRR!!! Mr. Wright! You... You can't be serious!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Judge:
This... This is an affront to the highest ranking officer in our law enforcement agency! To accuse the Chief of Police of blackmail... and murder!!!? That's i.... i... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-IMPOSSIBLE!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's too late, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no turning back for us now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Can you prove this, Mr. Wright? That the Chief, a high-ranking officer of the law, is involved in this murder!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Good question...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Regardless of his rank or title, Chief Gant is just a man. The question is, is he a criminal? I believe the evidence will tell.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Alright, then. Show us the evidence that ties Chief Gant to the murder of Detective Goodman. Just remember... It better be good!
</line>


<line>Judge:
This is the ID card list...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, the one that shows who entered the evidence room on the day of the crime. There was one ID on the list we couldn't determine the owner of yesterday... 7777777.
</line><line>Gant:
Sorry, but there's no way you can prove that's my card number.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's your number.
</line><line>Gant:!
</line><line>Judge:
What!? How do you know that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The safe in Chief Gant's Office requires a code to open. A seven-digit code...
</line><line>Judge:
Seven digits... You don't mean...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid so, Your Honor. The code was "7777777"... The same as the remaining ID card number on that list! Chief Gant! You entered the evidence room on the day of the crime!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Chief Gant! What do you have to say!?
</line><line>Gant:
... Nothing. The defense's search of my office was in violation of regulations.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And I will demand Mr. Wright be punished to the maximum extent of the law. But right now, this court demands an explanation from you... about the use of this ID card!
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Gant! So you admit it? You entered the evidence room... on the day of the crime!?
</line><line>Gant:
... What about it? I'm Chief of Police. Whether it's the evidence room or the bathroom, what's the difference? I can go anywhere I want.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell me. When you entered the room... were you alone?
</line><line>Gant:
I always go to the bathroom alone... as I do with the evidence room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Goodman wouldn't have happened to be with you that day... would he?
</line><line>Gant:
O-of course not! Why would he be? I hadn't seen him in days!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
You hadn't seen him... "in days"? Chief Gant... I'm afraid you've just undone yourself. On that day, you had to have met with Detective Goodman!
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean!? This trial's purpose is to determine Lana Skye's guilt!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
No it isn't, Your Honor. This trial's purpose is to determine the truth. If Chief Gant met the victim on the day of the crime, then we need to determine one thing: what transpired during that meeting!
</line><line>Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright! I'm going to have to ask you for evidence! Show us proof that the victim went to meet Chief Gant on the day of the crime!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Or to be more accurate, Jake Marshall stole it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!
</line><line>Gant:
Yet you are in possession of the report... which means you can't be sure if he filed it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
He filed it. How do I know, you ask? Because he needed to enter the evidence room that day.
</line><line>Judge:
He needed to?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. To transfer the evidence out.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!
</line><line>Gant:
I "accompanied" him?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!
</line><line>Gant:
Hold on. Let me guess what you're going to say next. I, the Chief of Police, murdered poor Goodman!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Exactly.
</line><line>Judge:
But wait! The Chief didn't necessarily need to accompany him to the evidence room. He could have just lent him his ID card.
</line><line>Gant:
Yes... Now that you mention it, I believe I might have done something of the sort.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Sorry, but that's not possible.
</line><line>Gant:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
According to the record, your card was only used once. But you showed us your ID card earlier. If you had really "lent" it to Detective Goodman, it would have been found on his body!
</line><line>Gant:
N... NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Gant! Y-you didn't...!
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The murder was most likely committed on the spur of the moment. No one in their right mind would choose the Police Department as a place to commit murder. After the murder, you contacted Lana at the Prosecutor's Office. Why else? To dispose of Detective Goodman's body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
However, the victim's body was discovered in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot. How did he manage to move it there?
</line><line>Gant:
I was at the Police Department the entire day, you know.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And everyone's aware that Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office after the ceremony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Everyone except me, it seems... Still, you're the Chief of Police. You have an entire police force at your disposal.
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, so you think I just ordered an officer to do it? "Hey you. Take this here dead body over to the Prosecutor's Office." I don't think so...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Chief Gant. You left all the evidence we need... to prove how you moved the body to the Prosecutor's Office. <textEffects>(And all this time I thought it was a useless clue just taking up space...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!
</line>



<line>Judge:
Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. Unless, of course, you have another explanation, Chief? Why else would you have asked Mr. Edgeworth to carry evidence from a closed case?
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's only one plausible explanation: to transport the body to your accomplice... Ms. Lana Skye!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! What's going on here!? Is there no room for rebuttal to the defense's outrageous accusations!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Think back to the photograph Ms. Starr took at the Prosecutor's Office. This was not a photo of the body being stuffed in the trunk to be taken away. It was exactly the opposite...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It is a photo of the body being taken from the trunk!
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Gant! Please, say something!
</line><line>Gant:
I believe... your time's up.
</line><line>Judge:
My "time's up"?
</line><line>Gant:
Sorry, Wrighto, but I'm having lunch with the District Attorney General after this. We have to get going if we're going to make it in time for the early bird special.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
B-but... The cross-examination isn't finished yet!
</line><line>Gant:
Remember what I told you earlier? A police chief... has all kinds of weapons at his disposal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
..."Weapons"...?
</line><line>Gant:
Like the right to refuse to testify. I'm invoking that right now.
</line><line>Judge:
What!? That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you're going to just run away after all this!?
</line><line>Gant:
"Run away"? Don't make me laugh, Worthy.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Gant:
"I stabbed ol' Goodman." That's what you're saying, right? But if you had any conclusive evidence, you would have presented it by now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well I...
</line><line>Gant:
You think I had Lana dispose of the body? If so, then show your proof and get it over with!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I'll say it again, Mr. Wright. Damon Gant is the current Chief of Police. This court will not tolerate any accusations against him without concrete proof. Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Do you have any concrete proof? Proof that Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman and made Ms. Skye dispose of his body?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Do I have any concrete "proof"...?)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Judge:
So... Er, what exactly is this evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's proof. As to whether or not it's enough to demonstrate the Chief's guilt... I'll let you be the judge!
</line><line>Judge:
But... I am the judge.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right... Well, what do you think, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
What I think, Mr. Wright, is I'm going to be late for my meal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess it wasn't enough...)</textEffects> Please, Your Honor! Give me just a little longer to consider!

<textEffects>(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...)</textEffects> No, Your Honor. At present I have no conclusive evidence.

Hmph! See, Udgey?
</line><line>Judge:
In that case... This court is forced to penalize you for your allegations against the Chief.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?

I don't gamble unless the stakes are high! It seems that Lady Luck was on my side again today. Okay Udgey, I'll leave the rest to you!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
"Lady Luck," hm? Maybe we should have a word with her.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth? What do you mean!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's one "Lady" who knows the real truth behind this trial... We haven't yet had the honor of hearing her testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A lady who knows the truth... Another witness!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In the absence of conclusive evidence, the only other method of proof is testimony.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Chief Gant has invoked his right to refuse to testify!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's still someone else. One more witness who can answer all the questions raised in this trial. Someone right in this very room!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this person!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph... Why are you asking me, Your Honor? Have you forgotten? The defense is the one calling witnesses today.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(She may not be willing to tell the truth... But we can't just stop now!)</textEffects> Yes, Your Honor! The defense calls forth...

<line>Judge:
The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
She was in the underground parking lot at 5:15 PM on February 21. Her task: to dispose of the victim's body... in accordance with a certain someone's orders!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no objections, Your Honor.

Very well. The court will now take its final recess for the day. In 15 minutes, we will reconvene to hear the defendant's testimony. This court is now in re-

Huh? Chief Gant! I thought you were going to eat.

Listen good, Lana!

<textEffects>(He's talking to Lana!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gant:
I don't think you need me to tell you this, but if you accept Mr. Wright's claim... there will be terrible consequences.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!

That's right... Your sister will be found guilty... for Neil Marshall's murder!

Looks like we managed to stay in the game.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. Thanks to your help, Edgeworth.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That Chief... He's something else, eh pals?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha. I'm not a "detective" anymore.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh yeah. Sorry about that...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah, don't worry. I've already decided where to work now! At your office!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My office...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Sure! I'll take the place of that top-knotted girl you used to work with!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Could he mean... Maya?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Still... Looks like we're all out of moves now. Chief Gant's done it again. How is it he always gets the upper hand!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not fair he has the right to refuse to testify!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Settle down, Wright. Remember what the judge said?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
But Chief! That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
"Risks"... What did he mean by that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's simple. If the Chief refuses to testify... the opposite also holds true.
</line><line>???:
You mean, he forfeits his right to say anything too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema! Are you okay?
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So she heard everything that's been going on.)</textEffects> Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before.
</line><line>Ema:
No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Relieved"?
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ever since her appointment as Chief Prosecutor, everyone who knew her... said she changed. Perhaps... it was easier that way for her.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you think I mean? To follow Chief Gant's orders. She must have shut herself up deep inside... to force herself to do anything and everything the Chief told her to do.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That must be why she became so cold...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey. Don't go blaming yourself, now. If you want to blame anyone, blame society, pal!
</line><line>Ema:
Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his "forgery," but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I... I see.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Well, we'd better get back. It's time for the final act!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ema, why don't you wait h-
</line><line>Ema:
No. I'm going with you.
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Ema:
I want to be there... when Lana tells the truth.

<line>Edgeworth:
Ms. Lana Skye. You are the Chief Prosecutor. I'm sure you're aware of what is required of you.
</line><line>Lana:
But Mr. Edgeworth... you already know everything... You know all that I've done these past two years.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Please provide the court with your testimony, Ms. Skye. And remember... you are under oath. We want to hear the truth.

There's no truth to this "blackmail" theory.
I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene.
My only motivation was to get Darke convicted. It had nothing to do with Ema.

</line><line>Lana:
Your Honor. I'm confessing to a capital offense. Of course I'm sure.

</line><line>Judge:
If this is true, then that means Chief Gant has nothing to do with this.
</line><line>Lana:
That's what I've been telling you from the beginning.

Please, Mr. Wright. You've got to help her! She's sacrificing herself because of me...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(But what if she's telling the truth?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
She's not. I know my own sister. Whenever she speaks stiffly like that, she's hiding something inside. Deep down, she's really screaming in agony!

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel. You committed that "crime" two years ago to protect your sister.
</line><line>Judge:
You mean the forgery at the scene where Neil Marshall was murdered?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If that truth were to be exposed now, the past two years of your life will have been useless. Even so, I am compelled to bring to everyone's attention a significant contradiction within your testimony!
</line><line>Lana:
A contradiction... in my testimony?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You testified, and I quote, "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
</line><line>Lana:
That's right...
</line><line>Judge:
Do you have a problem with that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood.
</line><line>Lana:
Yes. The prosecutor must have written it in his final moments.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.
</line><line>Lana:!
</line><line>Phoenix:
In order for the victim to be able to write his message on the jar, it must not yet have been broken before he died!
</line><line>Lana:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
He couldn't have written Ema's name on a shattered jar!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!

Chief Prosecutor. It seems you're as in the dark as we are... about the truth towards which we're headed.

Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of.
</line><line>Lana:

We found the final piece of this jar in Chief Gant's safe.
</line><line>Lana:
In the Chief's safe? But how...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I knew it! She really didn't know!)</textEffects> There's something even more disturbing about that final piece: There was still blood on it.
</line><line>Judge:
But the witness just testified... that she gathered every last piece and wiped the blood off of them!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, which leaves us with only one explanation. On the night Prosecutor Marshall was murdered... you were not the first one to show up on the scene! Chief Gant got there before you!
</line><line>Judge:
But couldn't the defendant have simply missed a piece?

Have you forgotten, Your Honor? When this witness arrived at the scene, the jar was already broken.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no way a name could have been written on a shattered jar. Another person discovered the scene prior to the witness!

I hope you're not implying this "person" was Chief Gant. At the time, he was looking for Darke downstairs. Besides, even if he was there first, why would he break the jar?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Damon Gant arrived at the crime scene prior to the witness. He proceeded to break the jar, and purposefully hid one of the broken pieces. Question: What is this action called?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Fabrication...
</line><line>Judge:
B-but why would Chief Gant do that!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In light of what happened afterwards, isn't it clear?
</line><line>Judge:
What happened afterwards...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Discovering the scene, Lana Skye believed her sister Ema killed the victim. Determined to help her sister, she sought Gant's aid. Lending her his "aid," Gant helped her create evidence that incriminated Darke, sparing Ema. And here is the reason! The reason why Ms. Skye became the Chief's puppet!
</line><line>Lana:
...!! N-no... I... I did it on my own...
</line><line>Ema:
Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake...
</line><line>Lana:
No, you didn't! It wasn't you, Ema! You didn't kill anyone! Don't believe anything Mr. Wright says! Defense attorneys make up the <textEffects><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="&#91;sic&#93;">he</textEffects></span><textEffects> ([sic])</textEffects> most foul lies to defend their clients!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Foul lies"...? <textEffects>(Imagine that, coming from my own client!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I guess you do seem the type who likes to twist the truth.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...! <textEffects>(Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Lana... may be right after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:! What do you mean, Wright?
</line><line>Ema:
So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
</line><line>Lana:
But...
</line><line>Phoenix:
If evidence was "fabricated" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!

B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall...

Ms. Skye! If you will!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This cross-examination may not change a thing. However, there is a possibility that it will, if you tell the truth!
</line><line>Lana:

When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword.
Ema and Darke were lying unconscious on the floor nearby.
When I saw what had happened, I thought she... did it.
That's why I erased all the evidence that linked her to the murder.
I had Chief Gant help me remove the body from the sword and carry it...
But if it all really was a fabrication, Ema might be innocent!

Surely it must have been left on the cloth by whoever shoved the victim into the sword.
</line><line>Judge:
What? Who's fingerprints are on this!?
</line><line>Gant:
I'm sure Wrighto has checked, haven't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Whose are they!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... ... ...They're Ms. Skye's. Ms. Ema Skye's.
</line><line>Ema:
What!? They're mine...? So I really did do it...
</line><line>Gant:
See? I told you it was conclusive.

But this was found in your safe! That means it's possible you forged it!
</line><line>Gant:
I don't know what you're talking about.

I don't remember any cloth in my safe. Do you really expect me to believe that?

</line><line>Phoenix:
But...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Give it up, Mr. Wright. It's over.
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You shouldn't have presented that... By presenting that evidence, you tied Ema Skye to Neil Marshall's death.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No...
</line><line>Judge:
It appears we have our killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
NNNO...NOOOOOO!!!

<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
</line><line>Gant:
What!? You lie!
</line><line>Judge:
Chief Gant?
</line><line>Gant:
You... you opened my safe! I know you took what was inside! The conclusive evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know what you're talking about.
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Wright! Why don't you show them? We found it together!
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, I see. It's because you know the truth, don't you? You know whose fingerprints are on it. That's why you won't present it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What are you talking about, Chief Gant!?
</line><line>Gant:
Can't you figure it out? Take a good look at this picture. See the victim's vest? Notice anything odd about the chest area?
</line><line>Judge:
It looks like part of it's been cut off for some reason.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mean, you had this...? In your safe?
</line><line>Judge:
What!? That means you... the Chief of Police... concealing evidence! This is going to be the biggest scandal in the history of the Police Department!!!
</line><line>Gant:
... Impressive... To be honest, I didn't think you had the gall, Wrighto.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Gant:
Well, I can't just let you pin me up as the murderer. I'll tell you what really happened.
</line><line>Judge:
What!? You mean you admit to it!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
I was the first person to arrive at the crime scene that day. It then occurred to me that I could use the situation to control Lana.
</line><line>Ema:
So you really were manipulating her!
</line><line>Gant:
I knew Lana. If I made it look like the blame lay with her sister... That when she saw the scene, she would ask me for my aid.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you "assisted" Ms. Skye!
</line><line>Gant:
I told her to arrange all the evidence. I had her plant the knife tip in the victim's body, and move the body across the room.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And I ended up using that evidence to get Joe Darke convicted!
</line><line>Gant:
When we rearranged the crime scene, I hid two pieces of evidence. I did this before Lana arrived at the scene.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Two pieces of evidence... You mean those items in your safe!
</line><line>Judge:
But... why?
</line><line>Gant:
For insurance, of course.
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Insurance"...?
</line><line>Gant:
I was sure my plan would work, but it's always bet to be prepared for the worst. I wasn't about to let anyone blame me for a murder that girl committed.
</line><line>Judge:
You mean you were calculating that far ahead while forging the evidence!?
</line><line>Gant:
Who do you take me for, a fool? I didn't make police chief by dumb luck. See this jar fragment? I hid the most legible part of Ema's name. I didn't expect Lana to go and wipe the blood off all the pieces.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But if you fabricated all the evidence... what's to say you didn't fabricate the message on this jar, too?
</line><line>Gant:
Ho ho ho... Some people just don't know when to quit, do they? That's why I kept one more item for "insurance."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You mean that piece of cloth?
</line><line>Gant:
Come on, Wrighto. Cough it up, already. I know you have it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Ema:
What are you waiting for, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
So you admit to it then, Chief Gant? That you were hiding the cloth you cut off the victim's vest in your safe?
</line><line>Gant:
Yes, I admit it. I didn't want to have to do that, being Chief and all, but it's a lot better than being portrayed as a murderer!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say for yourself? Just a moment ago, you said you didn't have any evidence you could present.
</line><line>Gant:
Foolish move, Wrighto. You should have shown it then before it was too late.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's been a long battle... but the moment of truth has finally arrived! As long as I don't mess up here, victory is mine!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now.
</line><line>Judge:
All right then, let's see this "conclusive" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, yes! At last you've finally brought it out into the open.
</line><line>Judge:
There's a handprint on this piece of cloth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests that be immediately sent to the lab for analysis! This handprint on the leather... There must have been a strong impact for it to be left so clearly!
</line><line>Judge:! You mean...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It could not have been forged. It must be authentic, conclusive evidence!
</line><line>Gant:
Ho ho ho... You're as slow on the uptake as ever, Worthy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?
</line><line>Gant:
Think about it. Wrighto had all this time to present this evidence... Yet he was reluctant to do so. Why would that be?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...! You mean you already know? You know whose fingerprints are on that?
</line><line>Ema:
M-Mr. Wright... Do you really know?
</line><line>Judge:
Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer! Whose fingerprints are they!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Very well. I'll tell you. <textEffects>(It should be okay now. Everything's proceeding as predicted.)</textEffects> The person whom these fingerprints belong to are...
</line>


<line>Judge:
Ema? Ema Skye!?
</line><line>Ema:
What!? They're mine...!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ema...
</line><line>Ema:
But why... Why didn't you tell me!?
</line><line>Gant:
Oh ho ho ho! You're really something, Wrighto! You knew this girl did it all along, and you still tried to pin the murder on me!
</line><line>Judge:
So it's true. Tragic, but true. This girl really did shove Prosecutor Marshall to his death.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Lana:
How could you!? You... you monster!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Skye...
</line><line>Lana:
You knew whose fingerprints those were all along, yet you... you acted like she really didn't...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
</line><line>Lana:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I said this trial isn't over yet.
</line><line>Gant:
Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Gant:
You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Gant:
I'm looking forward to pressing charges after the defendant is convicted. I'll have your badge, boy!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Gant:
What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
</line><line>Gant:
Oh? And what's that?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
</line><line>Judge:
What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?
</line><line>Judge:
It was Ema Skye, wasn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!
</line><line>Gant:
What!? A contradiction!? What is this fool babbling about!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! This piece of cloth... What could it possibly contradict!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!)</textEffects> Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!
</line>


<line>Gant:
And what exactly is this supposed to be...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This is the picture Ms. Skye took. Take a good look at it. See where the piece of his vest was cut out?
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... His shirt is showing underneath. It's hard to make out with all the blood on his vest, though.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh! But that piece of cloth... Wait... There's no blood on it!
</line><line>Gant:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Since Ema Skye's fingerprints are on this cloth, there's no doubt that she shoved the prosecutor aside! However! Mr. Marshall was not impaled on the sword!
</line><line>Gant:
No! Th-this is nonsense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now then, Chief Gant. Let me ask you something. Prosecutor Marshall was not impaled when he was shoved aside.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He most likely hit his head on the ground and was knocked out.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If so, then tell me. Who could it have been? Who could have arrived at the scene before Ms. Skye, picked up the unconscious prosecutor, and impaled him on the armor's sword?
</line><line>Gant:
Hnnngngghgghh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then, to make it look like Ema was responsible for the prosecutor's death, said person proceeded to write her name on the jar with the victim's blood. Then he broke the jar on purpose, to leave behind a clue, and make Lana believe her sister did it!
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember what you admitted only moments ago? That you personally cut out this bloodless piece of the victim's vest? Ironic, isn't it? Through the very act of creating "insurance," you proved that you were the actual murderer!
</line><line>Gant:
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(It's finished...)</textEffects>

</line><line>Gant:
Heh... Heh heh heh! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! That was close, Wrighto! You almost had me!
</line><line>Phoenix:!
</line><line>Gant:
Sorry, but you'll have to do better than that. I refute your allegations.
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, you "refute" his allegations?
</line><line>Gant:
You see, that piece of cloth... is illegal evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! What nonsense is this!?
</line><line>Gant:
Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a suspect! Remember, Udgey? Earlier, ol' Wrighto here concealed that piece of cloth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
So then... what's your excuse Wrighto? You do have some conclusive evidence, don't you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, that's true... The defense did refuse to present evidence!
</line><line>Gant:
At that moment, that piece of cloth ceased to be "legal evidence"!
</line><line>Ema:
But that's not fair...!
</line><line>Gant:
Hoo hoo hoo hooooo! Did you actually think you could best me in court? It looks like the last laugh's on you, son!
</line><line>Judge:
I'm afraid Mr. Gant's claim is legally correct. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
True... Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a person... assuming, of course, that the evidence is indeed illegal.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? Well, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(It seems... at last... The time for me to reveal my plan has finally arrived.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright. Do you admit to it? That you purposefully and illegally concealed this piece of cloth?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point.
</line><line>Gant:
Aha! So the evidence is illegal!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
No it isn't, Mr. Gant.
</line><line>Gant:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not that I "didn't" present evidence then... it's that I "couldn't."
</line><line>Judge:
What do you mean, you "couldn't"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are certain procedures involved when presenting evidence!
</line><line>Gant:
No, Udgey! Don't listen to his lies! He's nothing but a coward! You can't let him?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
There is only one issue left to be resolved in this trial: Is this evidence legal or not?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let us settle this once and for all. Earlier you refused to present evidence. If you can prove your conduct was not in violation of the law, then do so now!
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law."
</line><line>Gant:
What's this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more.
</line><line>Gant:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!
</line><line>Gant:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. It goes without saying I did not get approval from the Police Department.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Rule 2: unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident.
</line><line>Gant:
What!? What kind of nonsense is this!? You want "relevancy"? Just take one look at this picture and-
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?
</line><line>Judge:
That was shown only a few moments ago!
</line><line>Gant:
No...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's right. At the beginning of today's trial, that piece of cloth was still meaningless.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant.
</line><line>Gant:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You yourself confessed to a certain "truth."
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
</line><line>Gant:
Oh, yes!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
NNNNOOOOO!!!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It was then that you approved this cloth... as conclusive evidence. Yes! You, the Chief of Police, personally approved this cloth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!
</line><line>Gant:
N... N... Mmph... WA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO UH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW!!! I knew I should have gotten rid of him... That good-for-nothing scum! For two years he's been snooping around the department trying to get something on me! Crimes are being committed everyday, yet he insisted on hounding me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, your crime wasn't exactly petty.
</line><line>Gant:
He wanted to reinvestigate the case. He recruited Angel Starr, then convinced Bruce Goodman...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Goodman?
</line><line>Gant:
Yeah, that's right.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Marshall:
If the evidence is transferred I'll lose my only chance to find out the truth! Please, you've got to help me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
Goodman turned him down, as he ought to. Still, Jake Marshall didn't know when to quit.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He stole Goodman's ID card and tried to take the evidence!
</line><line>Gant:
Goodman came to me that day. He wanted to file a lost item report. I went with him to the evidence room. Then all of a sudden he had to speak out!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
What are you talking about, Goodman?
</line><line>Goodman:
Can you please reopen the investigation, Chief? We can't transfer the evidence out. There are too many questions left unanswered!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
He... told me to open up the evidence room and take it out.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Goodman:
It's not too late. I'll hand this to Marshall!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
Well, to be honest, I was a little panicked, too. I had a bad feeling about it, but never knew it would come to this. That's when I saw it... that accursed knife. I couldn't just pull it out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You would only increase the amount of blood and you couldn't finish what you started.
</line><line>Gant:
Even so, the blood was just pouring out. I didn't know who might stumble in, so I was wiping it up. I was worrying so much about the floor, I didn't realize my mistake.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe's bloody hand print...
</line><line>Gant:
I used to be known as the "crime computer"... But everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. I was too nervous. I had no business doing any of it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Then you put the body in my car?
</line><line>Gant:
I'm sorry! We couldn't think of any other way to move the body. We broke the trunk, but what's the big deal? You pull down a lot more than us detectives!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Grr...
</line><line>Phoenix:
W-what does this have to do with anything? You're horrible! How could you get Ms. Skye involved in all of this!?
</line><line>Gant:
Well, she had as much to lose as I did if the truth came out.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you took the evidence from Detective Goodman's locker?
</line><line>Gant:
I feel bad for having to do it. I couldn't sit around and pick and choose what to take.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... you left the jar fragment and gloves.
</line><line>Gant:
... Yeah... It looks like I was better off being an investigator of crimes than a committer. They all did their best to get in my way... I've got to hand it to them, they do their jobs well... much to my dismay.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Fake evidence doesn't hold up very well upon close examination. You must have known that...
</line><line>Gant:
Tell me, Worthy. What are you doing in court?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Me?
</line><line>Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
Well, looks like it's time to say goodbye. Oh, Udgey.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-what?
</line><line>Gant:
Looks like we'll have to cancel that lunch date. Sorry old friend!
</line><line>Judge:
... I'm sorry too, Damon Gant.
</line><line>Gant:
...
</line><line>Judge:
I knew you as you used to be, long ago. You were once a fine investigator, and an example to others on the force. I'm sorry to learn that you are no longer that person.
</line><line>Gant:
Those days are gone now, Udgey. Thanks for all the memories, though... Don't worry, you'll be fine! Now you have Wrighto here... and Worthy. With these two around, you can't go wrong... You see, if I listen carefully, I can hear it right now... The sound of a new beginning!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
There are two things I want you to understand.
</line><line>Lana:
Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent.
</line><line>Lana:
You're right. When this trial is over, I'll tell everything. All that I've done these past two years... from the time I had Gant help me forge evidence, up until today.
</line><line>Judge:
So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble.
</line><line>Lana:
... My, my. What high standards you have... for a rookie.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
I can see why Mia thought so highly of you. Who knows? A few years from now, you just might make it to the top. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ms. Skye...
</line><line>Lana:
And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. Believe me, I know how much of an ordeal it's been for you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph! It was nothing.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Liar...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Lana:
I was worried the pressure might break you. And yet... you rose above it all and guided Mr. Wright to victory. You've done well, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
S-stop it! I only did my job!
</line><line>Judge:
In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
</line><line>Lana:
Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date.
</line><line>Lana:
Yes. I understand, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Is there something amusing about all of this? Why are you smiling?
</line><line>Lana:
It's been a long time, Your Honor. A long time since I've felt free of these heavy chains...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, this trial has gone on far too long already. Regarding the charge of murder, this court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>Not Guilty</b></captions>
<line>Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(At long last... It's finally over...)</textEffects> E-Ema?
</line><line>Ema:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why the long face? I'm sorry your sister didn't get completely off the hook, but at least she wasn't convicted for a murder she didn't commit!
</line><line>Ema:
No, that's not it. Just now, after the trial ended...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lana:
I can see why Mia Fey thought so highly of you. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright. And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. You've done well.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
You know, I did my best too. But... Lana didn't say a single word to me.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Ema:
...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals! Hey, lighten up, pals. I'm only kidding!
</line><line>Ema:
Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Nope, not this time! I came today because of you, pal!
</line><line>Ema:
Me...?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right. I thought you'd like to see someone.
</line><line>Ema:
Lana!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
... Well, I won't tell if you won't.
</line><line>Lana:
Ema... I owe you an apology.
</line><line>Ema:
It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it.
</line><line>Lana:
That day, two years ago,
</line><line>Ema:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
was the first time in my life I ever panicked. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming. All I could think about was keeping you from getting wrapped up in that mess.
</line><line>Ema:
Sis...
</line><line>Lana:
I asked Gant to help me cover up the "truth." I thought I was doing it for your sake... But now I realize I was wrong.
</line><line>Ema:
...
</line><line>Lana:
I changed after that day. I had to... It was the only way I could make it through the past two years. I knew how much I was hurting you by distancing myself... but I couldn't bring myself to tell you what I did. I... I was scared. Scared that you'd look at me with those eyes of yours. I was scared of how you'd react if you knew...
</line><line>Ema:
But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
</line><line>Lana:
No...
</line><line>Ema:
Huh?
</line><line>Lana:
I turned my back on you that day. In hiding what I believed to be the truth, I was deceiving you!
</line><line>Ema:
Sis...
</line><line>Lana:
I'm such a fool... It took me all this time to realize it. Ema... I'm so sorry.
</line><line>Ema:
But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
</line><line>Lana:
You're... happy?
</line><line>Ema:
Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!
</line><line>Lana:
Oh Ema... Ema!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future. At least, that's what I felt, looking at those two sisters make up.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Lana:
Mr. Wright. Mr. Gumshoe.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
M-Me?
</line><line>Lana:
Thank you both, for all that you've done. I'm sure we'll meet again someday. Isn't that right, Edgeworth?
</line><line>Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Lana:
Stop hiding and come over here.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Where was he hiding!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I just came to say... Congratulations.
</line><line>Lana:
Thank you.
</line><line>Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Right. Well... I'll be going now!
</line><line>Lana:
Mr. Edgeworth. I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
We were the ones who acted corruptly, not you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... It's too late for me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No matter what anyone may say, I realized today that I can't change my own mistakes!
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Not only that, but I don't even trust myself anymore. Chief Gant was right...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
</line><line>Edgeworth:!
</line><line>Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
I do despise criminals. I planned to dedicate my entire life to fighting them. But in order to fight crime alone, one needs a "weapon." It's scary, but I've been thinking the same thing for quite some time now.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Who knows? Given enough time, I might have tried to pull something like Chief Gant did. That thought terrifies me. That's why I can't continue on as a prosecutor!
</line><line>Lana:
Edgeworth... Don't you understand? Damon Gant and your mentor, Manfred von Karma...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
were both the best of the best when it came to fighting crime. But they both made the same mistake.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Lana:
You said, "in order to fight crime alone, one needs a weapon." That may be right, but think back to today's trial. You weren't alone.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...!
</line><line>Lana:
You were working together with Mr. Wright. And because of that partnership, you were able to present evidence that otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What? Oh, uh... yeah. <textEffects>(What is this, a pop quiz?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! Show him what Lana's talking about!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Evidence... that neither Edgeworth nor I would have been able to find on our own?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
... It's time for me to go.
</line><line>Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you'll excuse me... there are still some loose ends that need wrapping up. Take care, Chief Prosecutor.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What will you do now?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, whatever you do, just remember. What happened in this trial can either make or break you as a prosecutor. In the end, it's up to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I know... It seems I owe you my thanks too, Wright. But what I face now... is my problem.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Edgeworth... I'll be waiting for you in court.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... Farewell.
</line><line>Lana:
I'd better be getting back too.
</line><line>Ema:
Okay. I'll come visit you!
</line><line>Lana:
It seems we both still have a lot to learn. Here, this is a little something for you.
</line><line>Ema:
"Scientific Investigation"...
</line><line>Lana:
It's the first book I ever bought. Study it well.
</line><line>Ema:
Thanks, Sis! I will!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
And so, another case came to a close. As for the sisters... I have faith. Faith that their lives... have only just begun. And as for me... I think it's time I started on a new journey of my own. A journey to rediscover myself.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Well, don't go trekking off just yet, pal!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? What is it, Detective?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
There's just a little matter to be resolved about the Chief Prosecutor. You see, she isn't supposed to be out of jail like this.
</line><line>Ema:
But...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I thought you said it was okay.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, well it may be "okay" with me, but the folks at the prison are a different story.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Basically, I had to bribe a guard in order to sneak her out for 30 minutes. Believe me, it wasn't cheap either!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Ema:
Way to go, Detective! I didn't know you had a wild side!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, well... ha ha! You see... Mr. Wright here's the one who'll be footin' the bill.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What, you think I could afford that with my salary? You gotta be kiddin' me, pal!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
</line><line>Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Wright! You're the best!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... <textEffects>(Why is it... I suddenly feel like I want to scream?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Since we're all here, why don't we all go together?
</line><line>Ema:
Yeah, that's a great idea! Come on, guys! Let's go!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:

<hr />
<line>Lana:
I arranged for a friend of mine in Europe to take care of Ema. She's a coroner. I think Ema will be pleased. As for me, this affair has pretty much ended my days at the Prosecutor's Office. Still, I'll manage to find my way back to the field somehow. Then I'll be able to investigate crimes together with Ema.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Gumshoe:
Yikes! I thought I was a goner for a moment there! In the end, though they overlooked my unauthorized investigation of the Chief's office. "If we penalized you any more, it'd be worse than firing you!" Yep. That's what they said. It just goes to show... You can't shake me off that easily!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Meekins:
My new mission is to guard the main entrance and take care of Billy! Can you believe it!? I've been demoted to a security guard! My partner's keeping an eye on the entrance for me today. I'll show them, though! Someday I'm going to make detective! Yes sir! Then I can be just like that Dick Gumshoe!
</line>
<hr />
<line>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Marshall:
What is it? Can't you see I'm havin' me a showdown with a steak lunch, pardner? Miss Starr managed to sneak this in to me. She's seeing one of the guards it seems. Well, cowboy... It seems like you did it. You even gave Bambina back her smile. Can you make sure Billy and the gang get their water?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Angel:
Looks like we won't be seeing each other for a while... As a farewell gift, I put a new meal on the menu: The Wright Way Lunch. The top layer tastes as bitter as defeat, but the bottom layer's as sweet as victory. Kids seem to dig the turnabout theme. It's a hot seller around exam time! Just make sure not to eat it backwards!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I'll never forget what that young defense lawyer said after the trial. Let's see, what was his name again? Mr. Left...? Anyway, he said he's been doing, er, something or other for, uh... how many years...? Well anyway! I've got another trial to get to, so I'd better be... Huh? Oh no! I forgot my gavel! Sorry, gotta go!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Aaaaah! Nothing soothes the soul like fresh, country air! Still, sometimes I do miss hearing Nick and his "objections"... Still, I can't go back until I'm a full-fledged spirit medium!
</line><line>???:
Maya! Afternoon training's about to begin!
</line><line>Maya:
Coming!!! Well, see you around Nick!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Bellboy:
Uh, Mr. Edgeworth? I brought you your tea... ...&#160;? What's going on?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ema:
Thanks for coming to see me off! I can't believe I'm going to Europe. Thank you, Mr. Wright! Thank you so much for everything!!! I'm a little sad, but I'll be all right! Whenever I want to see Lana, all I have to do is open this book...
