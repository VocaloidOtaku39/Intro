Phoenix:
No one can escape their <textEffects>past</textEffects>. The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the <textEffects>moon</textEffects> in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in <textEffects>hope</textEffects> towards tomorrow.

Phoenix:
<textEffects>(They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.)</textEffects> ............ 
<textEffects>(After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
............ It's even quieter in here than usual.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... It seems so empty, too.
</line><line>Trucy:
I just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know.
</line><line>Trucy:
But now, Athena is the one who's being accused...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
But Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
You know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. <textEffects>(Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Off we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Unnecessary evidence left at the office.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Cosmos:
Urgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Director! <textEffects>(He scooted away...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:

<line>Phoenix:
We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh?
</line><line>Starbuck:
Yup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong? <textEffects>(I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
As I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(H-He saw Athena?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. "Congratulations on your acquittal," she said. "Now you can go back into space someday."
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Starbuck:
But I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile!
</line><line>Trucy:
She held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena.
</line><line>Starbuck:
There's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!)</textEffects> Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you.
</line><line>Starbuck:
I know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to!

The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape...
</line><line>Trucy:
The door to <textEffects>Launch Pad 1</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Starbuck:
Yeah, except, right now, the door leads to the <textEffects>Space Museum</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now?
</line><line>Starbuck:
Yeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So they're recreating the conditions, huh? <textEffects>(I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.)</textEffects> Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us?

Sure. Just let me have my prints scanned here...

<line>Phoenix:
Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion.
</line><line>Cosmos:
Hmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.
</line><line>Cosmos:
Urghk!
</line><line>Phoenix:
He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum!
</line><line>Cosmos:
Aaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How is he able to spin around like that...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>
Phoenix:
If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch?
</line><line>Cosmos:
If I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...)</textEffects> But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident?
</line><line>Cosmos:
W-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety!
</line><line>Phoenix:
But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely?
</line><line>Cosmos:
B-Because I went to one of those "mediums" that everyone's talking about these days.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone.
</line><line>Cosmos:
Yes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(AKA, a regular ol' telephone.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Cosmos:
"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned..." I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The bomber said, "It's been a while"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? <textEffects>(Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, "It's been a while"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank!
</line><line>Cosmos:
Gaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?!
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>
Cosmos:
...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Cosmos:
I let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time.
</line><line>Cosmos:
Ngaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?!

</line><line>Phoenix:
So you really think the same <textEffects>spy</textEffects> is behind this incident and the one seven years ago?
</line><line>Cosmos:
Yes. I'm sure of it.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then, this spy... must be the "<textEffects>phantom</textEffects>" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Fulbright:
But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... "The hunt I've been on for the <textEffects>phantom</textEffects> of seven years past continues even still."
</line><line>Fulbright:
For starters, that case happened right here at this very <textEffects>Space Center</textEffects>, too.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Trucy:
So if we can find this "phantom"...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too.
</line><line>Trucy:
What about him?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is <textEffects>innocent</textEffects>. That's still an "if," though...
</line><line>Trucy:
Hmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in!
</line><line>Cosmos:
Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed!
</line><line>Trucy:
Do you think he's going to be all right, Daddy?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too.
</line><line>Cosmos:
If you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds...
</line><line>Trucy:
It's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum!

Let's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit.
</line><line>Trucy:
Oh, wow! Look at that photo of the team!
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before.
</line><line>Trucy:
Everybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's check out the newspaper article, too. "HAT-1 Launch Imminent"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage.
</line><line>Trucy:
They really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket...
</line><line>Phoenix:
It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay.
</line><line>Trucy:
"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member," it says.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Not a replica, huh? <textEffects>(I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>HAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record.</textEffects>

Hello...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here?
</line><line>Woods:
I... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene...
</line><line>Phoenix:
You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her.
</line><line>Woods:
Thena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center?
</line><line>Woods:
What, you didn't know...? She used to <textEffects>live here</textEffects>, when she was a little girl.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... <textEffects>(No wonder she knew so much...)</textEffects> Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail?

</line><line>Trucy:
So we need to investigate the <textEffects>robotics lab</textEffects>, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through...

Fulbright:
Well! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business?
</line><line>Fulbright:
To tell the truth, I'm here to interview <textEffects>Ted Tonate</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?!
</line><line>Fulbright:
He suddenly said he's ready to tell the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more.
</line><line>Trucy:
Incredible? What was he saying?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Why don't you hang around and hear it for yourself?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Really? Us? Are you sure?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>YOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>VIOLENCE -&gt; NOQUESTION -&gt; OK</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
"No violence"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I... I...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this "truth" of yours about the courtroom you blew up?
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM!</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
Wh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE <span style="color:#E16935">REMOTE SWITCH</textEffects>! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED!</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS...</textEffects> ...But that's who blew up the courtroom!
</line><line>Trucy:
You expect us to buy that?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying.
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>PARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB.</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
And there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>OH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM...</textEffects>

<textEffects>(Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...)</textEffects>

Well, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning!
</line><line>Tonate:
<textEffects>AAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...!</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
I'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes.
</line><line>Trucy:
You're going to see Athena now?
</line><line>Fulbright:
That's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Trucy:
And after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. Sounds like a plan.

All this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray!
</line><line>Blackquill:
I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Prosecutor Blackquill!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Aura:
Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk!

M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today?
</line><line>Aura:
"Enough for today"?! Today is all there is when there's no <textEffects>tomorrow</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("When there's no tomorrow"? What is she talking about?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
We have company, Aura. Please try to calm down.
</line><line>Aura:
All right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Ugh...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Wright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. <textEffects>(You bounced back to business quick!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
P-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do!
</line><line>Blackquill:
But, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence.
</line><line>Blackquill:
I wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono!

Not a malfunction. They're staging a <textEffects>revolt</textEffects>! The machines are rebelling against humans! They've holed themselves up in the Space Center and taken the visitors as hostages!

<textEffects>But it IS true that I've taken hostages, so you better not make me mad. ...Hey, you! Hostage 1! Come here. I'll let you talk to them.</textEffects>

Bobby Fulbright, here! I'm all ears!

<textEffects>I want you to bring someone to me: Clay Terran's murderer, Athena Cykes.</textEffects>

<textEffects>(Athena...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
N-Now hold on just one moment! I can't just give in to a demand like that!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>So you don't care what happens to these hostages, huh? I'll just pick one out, then...!</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
N-No! Wait! Gaaagh! M-M-Mr. Lawyer! I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you need me to <textEffects>buy some time</textEffects>, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either.
</line><line>Fulbright:
O-Of course I won't! Now, I'd better go contact headquarters!

</line><line>???:
<textEffects>What are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else.
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>All right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this "real killer"?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. <textEffects>The UR-1 Incident</textEffects>... I believe you have a personal interest in that case?
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>Hmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is...</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it...

<textEffects>Just... what exactly are you proposing?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>............Hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's good! Real good... Hey, Detective! I'll give you one hour. Get a courtroom ready!</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
O-One hour?! B-But that's impossible! Please give me at least until tomorrow!
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>If you don't mind losing hostages, you can take all the time you want. Oh, but wait...! If we're going to have a retrial, we'll need a prosecutor. Don't worry, I'll take care of that!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(S-She will?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
<textEffects>And I guess I can be fair and let you come in and check out the crime scene. But Hunk of Junk here will be watching you, so don't try anything funny, you got that? Now, follow Hunk of Junk! Riot police, make way! We're coming through!</textEffects>

Hello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a "Prosecutor" anymore, are you? Um...

He's <textEffects>chief prosecutor</textEffects> now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right?

</line><line>Pearl:
But did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So that means... he must still be hiding something.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Right. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, I know. The part about the <textEffects>spy</textEffects>, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wright! How on earth do you know about that?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 Miracle.
</line><line>Pearl:
Don't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy...
</line><line>Phoenix:
We can stay the execution...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence.

Let's do it together!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
So what do you think, Wright? Any ideas?

There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth?
</line><line>Pearl:
What?! He did?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yup. He called it a "special request." He reached out to me while I was still disbarred.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Simon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence.
</line><line>Pearl:
And then maybe she'll release the hostages!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox.
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>Mr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena.
</line><line>Clonco:
<textEffects>She's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So I'm still being watched, huh?)</textEffects> I'll see you in court, Edgeworth.

I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place!
