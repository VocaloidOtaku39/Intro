<line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Gumshoe:
..........
</line><line>Kay:
...He's not coming.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
He's not coming, sir.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How long does he intend to keep us waiting...!?
</line><line>Kay:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no need to get your cravat in a twist.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>Ethan Rooke's murder</textEffects>... Two days after the incident, we visited the detention center. Naturally, we were hoping to meet with the defendant, Horace Knightley. His trial was set to begin the next day, with me serving as the prosecutor.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Still, he is rather late... You there! Do you know what's going on?
</line><line>Guard:
I-It is certainly strange... I'll try calling him one more time...
</line><line>Guard:
I-It's terrible! I-It's... Knightley! H-He's been murdered!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat!? What did you say!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Murdered? <textEffects>(Inside the detention center?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You there! Take us to the crime scene, posthaste.
</line><line>Guard:
Yes, sir!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Knightley's not in his cell? I thought he was being held there.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Guard:
What are you doing, sir!? This way!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-Where are you taking us, pal? Through this door is the...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ah... It's the <textEffects>prison</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Prison? Then what were the small rooms back there?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Those cells we just passed are part of the <textEffects>detention center</textEffects>. They're used for holding suspects temporarily, while they await for their trial. What lies ahead... is a facility that serves a completely different purpose.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This is where criminals who have been declared guilty serve out their sentence, pal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's the one place a Great Thief does not want to end up, Kay.
</line><line>Guard:
I'm opening the door now! Please, follow me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Th-There's no mistaking it... Knightley's... dead! Moreover, he was murdered inside the prison walls... How exactly did this happen!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>March 27, 10:32 AMPrisonWorkroom A</textEffects></captions>
<line>Kay:
I-I can't believe something like this would happen to Mr. Knightley!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. I can't believe it either... But the scene you see before you is the unmistakable reality.
</line><line>Kay:
Besides... Wasn't Mr. Knightley supposed to be in the detention center?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. He was. Knightley hadn't had his trial yet. Before a suspect is found guilty, they're detained in the detention center's holding cells. <textEffects>(They only enter the prison after they have received a guilty verdict. Knightley should not have been moved in here...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Do you think he passed through those giant doors that we went through earlier, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Huge metal doors and a long passageway separate the prison and the detention center. As a suspect, Knightley wouldn't have been able to pass through.
</line><line><textEffects>Floor Plans jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What happened to Knightley... In order to solve this mystery, we must first investigate the crime scene.

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The fingers of the glove are covered in blood...)</textEffects> This glove was dropped after the pool of blood formed.
</line><line>Kay:
Eh! Why is that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If it was on the floor before the pool of blood had formed... ...the blood would have formed an outside around the glove.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! I see. The blood would have only gotten on the edges of the glove!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This glove was discarded after it was covered in blood...
</line><line>Kay:
That must mean the killer left it behind!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's highly probable. At the very least, the person who dropped this saw the body. You there!
</line><line>Guard:
Wh-What is it, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Do you recognize this glove?
</line><line>Guard:
Yes, sir! The inmates use these for prison labor. That's odd... Rubber gloves are usually kept in the inmate's rooms... They are strictly regulated, so you can't just take them out!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Indeed, there are no signs of any other rubber gloves in the room.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
He's covered with a dirty sheet.
</line><line>Kay:
There's a rope on top of the sheet.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Was Knightley tied up with this rope?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Rope data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's take a look under the sheet. We might be able to find something.

<line>Kay:
Yikes! This sheet is <textEffects>bright red</textEffects>!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well. We've collected quite a bit of evidence.
</line><line>Kay:
He he! With the three of us here, it's a piece of cake! Right, Gummy?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! We're the Invincible Trio!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's too early to start celebrating. There is still something we haven't found yet.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eh? What haven't we found yet, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What is missing from this crime scene?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
The <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects> that took the victim's life has not been found yet.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah! Now that you mention it, you're absolutely right, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective. Get your act together. Isn't that the most basic of the basics?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ugh. I'm sorry, sir.
</line><line>Kay:
Don't worry about it, Gummy! I didn't notice it either!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's not much of a consolation.)</textEffects> In this prison, dangerous objects that could be used as weapons are strictly regulated. It'd be quite dangerous if the inmates got their hands on them... Obtaining a <textEffects>murder weapon</textEffects> and carrying it around is not an easy task.
</line><line>Kay:
I see! You have a point!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What was the <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</textEffects>? And where did it go? That could be the key to solving this case.)</span>
</line><line>???:
Huh? There are visitors here already? Sorry to barge in like this. Is this the crime scene?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're...!
</line><line>???:
Huh? You... Aren't you... That piercing gaze... That furrowed brow...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...It has been a long time. Mr. Shields.
</line><line>Ray:
Yes, yes. That frilly thing around your neck and that stiff greeting. There's no doubt about it! Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. Fancy meeting you here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Gumshoe:
What are you saying, pal! Mr. Edgeworth's not that old man!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective... It's fine.
</line><line>Ray:
Oh it's you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I thought you looked a bit young. He he he. You two are so similar. Looks like your Uncle Ray got you two mixed up again.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...You never change. How many years has it been since we last saw each other...
</line><line>Ray:
Hmm. I've already forgotten. Your Uncle Ray has been overseas these past few years. But you know... There's something I still haven't forgotten. About you... and your betrayal.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Kay:
I-I'm getting some bad vibes over here. Do you know this guy, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to introduce him to you. Raymond Shields, attorney at law.
</line><line>Ray:
Ace Attorney Ray Shields at your service. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, sir.
</line><line>Kay:
Kay Faraday. Nice to meet ya! I'm a Great Thief! Ah, but I'm currently on hiatus.
</line><line>Ray:
Great Thief? Well, well. That sounds romantic, how wonderful!
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! Mr. Shields, you get it, right? I'm currently recruiting new members! The registration forms are easy to fill out!
</line><line>Ray:
That's splendid. Uncle Ray would love to join your little gang!
</line><line>Kay:
I'm sorry, but we're only accepting bright, cheerful, and energetic girls.
</line><line>Ray:
I see. That's too bad. Well, how about a hug then? As a sign of affection.
</line><line>Kay:
...No.
</line><line>Ray:
I guess not. He he he. This isn't Europe after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. What are you doing here?
</line><line>Ray:
Oops. That's right! Sorry, sorry. Preventing the attorney from investigating the crime scene is the <textEffects>Von Karma way</textEffects>, isn't it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective! Restrain yourself. This... can't be helped.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Eh...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. Are you the defense attorney for Horace Knightley?
</line><line>Ray:
That's right. Or should I say... I was his defense attorney.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Shields is the defense attorney. If Knightley had not been murdered... ...I would have been going up against him in court... I should listen to what he has to say.)</textEffects>

<line>Ray:
Well, let's reveal the correct answer! Prosecutor Edgeworth's answer is... Wrong! The correct answer is the <textEffects>Workroom</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
... <textEffects>(All three choices were wrong. I hate it when he does that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
The inmates carry out various kinds of prison labor in here. It also serves as a rehab program, allowing them to receive job training in prison.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So... How do they monitor this room? Who is in charge of the keys to the entrance?
</line><line>Ray:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Even your Uncle Ray doesn't have all the answers. Hey. You there, could you tell us?
</line><line>Guard:
Yes, sir! This room doesn't use any locks and keys! Instead of locks, the doors are equipped with <textEffects>sensors</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean by that?
</line><line>Guard:
All of the prison inmates are wearing electronic <textEffects>bracelets</textEffects>! When a <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> passes through the door, it activates the <textEffects>sensor</textEffects> and... *wiii-uuu, wiii-uu, wiii-uu* ...An alarm will sound. After a certain amount of time has passed, the bracelet will emit a painful shock! If the bracelets are tampered with... it will emit an electric shock three times more powerful.
</line><line>Kay:
Eeehh! Th-That's terrifying!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It's to ensure that the inmates follow the rules. Although it seems a bit harsh.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Guard:
That's why whenever an inmate goes through a door, a guard has to accompany them... ...to deactivate the sensor first.
</line><line>Ray:
...And that's that.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did any of the inmates use this workroom today?
</line><line>Guard:
In the past few days no one has used this room. I'm sure of it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So not one inmate has entered this room today...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Door Sensor data jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(If that's the case... ...it raises a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects> with the crime scene. There is something in this crime scene that should not exist... I will use my powers of <textEffects>deduction</textEffects> and inspect the crime scene again...)</span>

<line>Edgeworth:
The inmates cannot freely enter this room. As they're wearing <textEffects>bracelets</textEffects> that set off the sensors. According to the guard, it seems that no inmates were scheduled to enter this room today. However, a rubber glove used by the inmates was left in here. That is a direct contradiction!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Then, who left this rubber glove in here, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't know... yet. However, it seems that this rubber glove is connected to our case.

<line>Edgeworth:
Guard! Aside from the inmates and prison guards, does anyone else have access to the room?
</line><line>Guard:
Umm. Well, this is a prison facility after all. Only inmates and prison guards come here...

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...?
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. What are you saying? There are others that come in here. Aside from inmates and prison guards, there are <textEffects>certain things that can enter this room</textEffects>.
</line><line>Guard:
! Are you talking about them? But. They're...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields! What are these "things" that you speak of?
</line><line>Ray:
It should be obvious. You came all the way here without seeing one, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Usually you can find them walking around the prison facility... Well, you'll see once you leave this room, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hey! You're just saying that to get Mr. Edgeworth to leave, pal!
</line><line>Ray:
What now? Don't you trust me? Mr. Detective. You have a big body, but a small mind.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
What did you say, pal!

Detective Gumshoe!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ugh... S-Sorry, sir.
</line><line>Ray:
Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what Uncle Ray has been talking about.
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>March 27, 11:06 AMPrisonHallway</textEffects></captions>
<line>Ray:
This place is a little different from your normal prison. There are more than just the prisoners and guards living here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Animals...!
</line><line>Ray:
Yep, animals. According to the guard... ...they introduced animal therapy here several years ago. Each prisoner is assigned one animal. In other words, they receive a pet partner.
</line><line>Kay:
Huh! That... seems kinda fun!
</line><line>Ray:
Plus, learning to take care of their pet is a great qualification to have.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! So you mean that workroom!
</line><line>Ray:
Yep. That's where the prisoners practice taking care of their pets.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
S-So then, the "thing" you mentioned, that could enter the crime scene is...
</line><line>Ray:
Right. These <textEffects>animals</textEffects>.
</line><line><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
But that doesn't make any sense, pal! Why would an animal leave behind a rubber glove!?
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. Quite right. But the fact remains that they could have entered the crime scene.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Can you please talk some sense into this man!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, are the animals allowed to go wherever they please?
</line><line>Ray:
Most of the doors in this prison are fitted with <textEffects>sensors</textEffects>. The <textEffects>sensors</textEffects> not only sound an alarm in response to the prisoners' <textEffects>bracelets</textEffects>. They also respond to the animal's "microchip" and open the doors for them.
</line><line>Kay:
Microchip?
</line><line>Ray:
It's like a tiny machine embedded under the animal's skin. All it takes is a simple injection, "psh!", and the microchip is inserted.
</line><line>Kay:
Whaaaa! Th-That sounds painful...
</line><line>Ray:
I've heard it's not that painful... But, anyway. Since the animals aren't criminals, they are allowed to move around freely.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(How ironic... The ones with the most freedom in this prison are the animals...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Door Sensor data updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
But still, they can't go out of the prison. The prison's entrance does not have a sensor. .....Oh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hm? <textEffects>(What's that? Is that a bell...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What's that?
</line><line>........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Wh-What's this... This dog? It has a bell on its collar... Was this the sound that we heard earlier?)</textEffects> ........
</line><line>........ Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you glaring at each other?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...I mustn't lose!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, you're not good with dogs, are you, sir? I'll tame that dog myself! Here boy, here boy! It completely ignored me, sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Compared to the other animals, there's something different about this one. I'm sensing a great hostility towards me only...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Well, now that I've introduced you to the animals... What's next on the agenda?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Of course, we question those related to the case, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. We should gather information about the state of things when the body was discovered.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
We'll start with... you in that cell! Tell us what you know!
</line><line>Prisoner:
........
</line><line>Gumshoe:
H-He's completely ignoring me, sir...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Y-You there. Do you know anything about the incident?
</line><line>Prisoner:
........
</line><line>Kay:
Uuugh... H-He's scary!
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. Don't be so cold. Come on, you can talk to us. Or, how about an introductory hug?
</line><line>Prisoner:
.....It's... time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
! <textEffects>(Wh-What was that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
S-Sorry. Was Uncle Ray's joke a little too much?
</line><line>Prisoner:
........ ......Exercise time.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This man... is clearly odd! I need to get some answers from him.)</textEffects> Your... name is?
</line><line>Elbird:
Me... I'm prisoner number D-259. Jay Elbird. ...Gotta raise my metabolism. I can't let my muscles rest.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Muscles aside, it looks like you've lost a lot of weight.
</line><line>Elbird:
Half of the match is won even before it has begun. Yeah... Gotta make the weight limit.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Err... Are you entering some kind of tournament? Ah! Perhaps as a boxer!
</line><line>Elbird:
Yeah, I'm a former boxer, but exercise is just... a hobby of mine.
</line><line>Kay:
Well then, it sure looks like it's the bear's hobby too! Hee hee... He's hanging on like an apron. So cute!
</line><line>Elbird:
This is Rocky the polar bear. He's my partner.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's loosened his tongue. Maybe we can try asking him now...)</textEffects> Where were you and Rocky at the time of the incident.
</line><line>Elbird:
......I don't know anything. I got nothing to say to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That's for me to decide. Now, answer the question.
</line><line>Elbird:
D-Didn't I just tell you? I know nothing!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Nngh... He has no intention of talking.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
In that case, you've got no choice but to use "that"!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. If he insists he has nothing to do with this, we'll just have to prove there's a connection. Mr. Elbird, by all means, you WILL tell us what you know.
</line><line>Elbird:

Huh? If you wanna fight with me... Get into your fighting stance!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
.........
</line><line>Elbird:
What, are you throwing in the towel already?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This is not a fist fight. Welcome to the war that is chess. By the way... Hasn't all that moving around tired you out?
</line><line>Elbird:
Don't underestimate my stamina! You wanna test me? With that body of yours!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
.....
</line><line>Elbird:
I ain't tired at all. Well, first off... I held back in my training today. I just stayed quietly in my cell.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Quietly? Then what's with all that sweat?
</line><line>Elbird:
...B-Buzz off! That's all I've got to say. I'm getting a little tired...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You're a well-trained boxer... However, you need more practice in the art of lying. Getting a little tired? That's not possible! You said that you stayed quietly in your cell just a moment ago!

<line>Elbird:
...! Rocky. It looks like this is gonna be a tough opponent.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This man... It looks like he's still hiding something. Next, I'll ask him about <textEffects>the time of the incident</textEffects>. I do not need to use fists. My words alone are enough for a K.O.!
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Elbird:
Muscles strengthen while they're resting. Sleep is important.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well then, I'm sorry to have woken you. Rest is a part of training... Right?
</line><line>Elbird:
...O-Oh? ...S-So you get it after all. Not bad, Mr. Prosecutor.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
...Oh? I don't recall ever introducing myself as a prosecutor. How did you know?
</line><line>Elbird:
Th-That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The conversation we had when we first entered this room... Were you, by any chance, eavesdropping on us? In that case, there's no way you could have been asleep! You lied to us!
</line><line>Elbird:
...! You got me there. You pack a nice punch. Yeah, I lied about sleeping. So what? I was just exercising in this room. You got a problem with that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Well, I now know he was awake. I should remember this <span style="color:#E16935">clue</textEffects>.)</span>

<line>Edgeworth:
Answer the question! What was the situation like at the time of the incident!
</line><line>Elbird:
Sorry, but I got no answers for you. I was asleep then. Rocky was too.
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Let's try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Stop telling such an obvious lie! Didn't you admit it earlier? You were exercising...!
</line><line>Elbird:
Tsk... Looks like I just ate a counter.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your back's against the ropes and there's no way out. Just confess already!
</line><line>Elbird:
...! H-Hey, quiet down a bit. If outsiders like you make a racket, you'll frighten the animals again.
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
You've been persistent. However, I'm afraid you're about to hit the mat. You said "again" just now. Did something happen earlier? To frighten the animals!?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Elbird:
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah! D-Dammit...! How could I have gotten sucker punched like that! Y-Yeah... There was this great scream back then. It startled the animals. Dang! I would never have lost in a real ring!

Hmph... Checkmate.

Don't lose focus, Kay. The real game has just begun.

Let's just stop for a moment. Uncle Ray's got one important thing to say. It must be fate that has brought us together after all these years. I have received the opportunity to observe your skills carefully. And... ...I'll be giving a detailed report to <textEffects>"that person"</textEffects> about how much you've grown.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
This doesn't concern Kay. She doesn't need to know!
</line><line>Ray:
Whoa there. You scared me. Don't get so worked up.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You can do what you like. It doesn't matter to me.
</line><line>Ray:
...How you have been leading your life ever since you were tainted by the Von Karma way... I'm sure "that person" would be interested. I feel that it's my duty to report it to him. I'll expose your mistakes here, I won't let you disappoint him any further.
</line><line>Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth... Just what are you guys talking about?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Don't concern yourself with it. Our only opponent now is Elbird. Well then, let's hear it. What do you know about the case?
</line><line>Elbird:
...You're gonna be sorry.

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- About the Incident --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Elbird:
Recreation time ended around 10 AM.
I returned to this room and went straight to my training.
Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, "AAARGH! I've been stabbed!"
It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...
I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
...That's odd. You really weren't bothered by that shout?
</line><line>Elbird:
Even if I was, there was nothing I could do. Look out for number one before you look out for others. That's the basic rule in prison.
</line><line>Ray:
Indeed. Even if he wanted to take a look he'd still be locked in his cell.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Is all that training equipment yours? You seem to have quite a collection.
</line><line>Elbird:
I get them from the <textEffects>Supplier</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
Supplier...?
</line><line>Elbird:
You can get just about anything if you put in an order. It's our secret shop.
</line><line>Ray:
That's quite convenient. So, if Uncle Ray wanted a cute girl...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
In that case, you should order a book on how to give testimony. Hmph... Because I'm going to knock you down for the count in one hit.
</line><line>Elbird:
You're gonna K.O. me? Stop kidding around...!
</line><line>Ray:
Heeey... Don't ignore your Uncle Ray!

<line>Kay:
If this place wasn't a prison, Mr. Knightley might have been able to get help.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I don't believe he could have been saved.
</line><line>Kay:
Eh! But, what if someone had come running to his aid...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Elbird is clearly lying. But... what possible reason would he have to do this? To find out, I'll have to point out the contradiction.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. Can you hear my voice clearly?
</line><line>Elbird:
Why you... You mocking me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The victim received a fatal blow to the throat. Which means... he couldn't possibly have screamed.
</line><line>Elbird:
!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So, why did you hear a nonexistent scream?
</line><line>Elbird:
Th-That's...! There should have been a scream...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There <textEffects>should</textEffects> have been one?
</line><line>Elbird:
Dang it! I oughta rip that smug look off your face! Yeah. You're right! I never heard a scream! The one who heard it was the guy in the next cell!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The next cell...?)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
Uhh, the next cell...
</line><line>Prisoner:
Ah? What's up? Yeah, I heard the scream. Recreation time had just ended. It happened after we returned to our cells. So then, I tell that guy, "I heard a great scream."
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Can you describe that scream for me?
</line><line>Prisoner:
Sure, I never told that guy about the contents of the scream though... "AIEEEEEEEEEE! Someone! Come quickly! A man's been...!" Something like that.
</line><line>Ray:
Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...but rather, it was <textEffects>the first person to discover the body</textEffects> who screamed.
</line><line>Kay:
I see! That solves that mystery! So, there was nothing wrong with Mr. Elbird's testimony!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Is that really true? Or is there still a problem with Elbird's testimony...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
No... In this case, a new problem has presented itself. Mr. Elbird, why did you not hear the scream?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
It's odd that he didn't hear the scream, sir! Hey you! Why didn't you hear the scream, pal!
</line><line>Elbird:
.......... Guaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aieeeeeeeee!
</line><line>Elbird:
...... ...You guys, do you suspect me? I was shut up in this stupid cell the whole time... How could I have killed someone in the workroom?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
! Th-That... would be impossible, wouldn't it?
</line><line>Prisoner:
Yeah! None of us could've killed him! If we could've killed him, we would've already killed you guys by now!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Aieeeeee!
</line><line>Elbird:
You guys, don't think you're going to get out of this prison alive...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I nearly forgot... Despite being locked inside cages, these guys are still dangerous criminals!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
He he... Looks like we got ourselves in a pretty bad situation here.

Wh-Who was that?

...Please be silent.
</line><line>Elbird:
What? Who're you? Can't you see we're busy here!
</line><line>???:
Silence is golden.
</line><line>Elbird:
Wh-What the...
</line><line>???:
Now, your hands. You shall remain silent while under the judgment of the law. You should be thankful. You get to live your life without the need of money. You are to receive the blessings of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. Guard. ...If you would please.
</line><line>Guard:
Congratulations. You get to spend the night in the <textEffects>disciplinary room</textEffects>.
</line><line>Elbird:
Eh...! Th-That's! N-No! Not there! Anywhere but there!
</line><line>???:
Accept this wonderful blessing! Let your heart be reborn! Cast away your sins!
</line><line>Elbird:
Stop it! Noooooooooo!
</line><line>???:
Oh, <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. Give this man your blessings. ...I thank thee.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You are...?
</line><line>Courtney:
My name is Justine Courtney. I am privileged to be a Judge... An emissary of the strength of the law.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A judge, you say? Why are you here?
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... I came to meet with you personally. I convey the will of the <textEffects>Prosecutorial Investigation Committee</textEffects>. That is my appointed task.
</line><line>Kay:
<textEffects>Prosecutorial Investigation Committee</textEffects>? What's that?
</line><line>Courtney:
Do not use that name so lightly. Those are the sacred words of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>.
</line><line>Ray:
Since little Kay doesn't know, Uncle Ray will explain it for her! The <textEffects>P.I.C.</textEffects> is an assembly comprised of 11 members. Their job is to check if prosecutors are doing their jobs properly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
If I'm not mistaken, its members are elected from politicians and those of the legal profession. ...So, I take it you are one of those members?
</line><line>Courtney:
...Indeed. I am thankful they judged me worthy of such a task.
</line><line>Ray:
I, too, am thankful that I was able to meet you here. Ahem. How about a hug of thankfulness?
</line><line>Courtney:

</line><line>Courtney:
The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee also shares deep ties with the Bar Association.
</line><line>Ray:
Hey, I was just kidding. No need to make such a scary face.
</line><line>Kay:
Errr. So your job is to find bad prosecutors and punish them?
</line><line>Courtney:
Well said! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law. Our job is to remove problematic prosecutors from their cases. And so, those people not fit to be prosecutors... ...will be stripped of their <textEffects>Prosecutor's Badge</textEffects>.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-What business does this <textEffects>Whatchamacallit Committee</textEffects> have with Mr. Edgeworth, pal! We're in the middle of an investigation here...

</line><line>???:
Wow, you're thick. Seriously, how thickheaded can you be?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
And just who do you think you are, pal!
</line><line>Debeste:
Me? I'm a prosecutor. Sebastian Debeste is my name. Haven't you heard of me? At the Prosecutor's Office, everyone calls me "The Best". Ah, I'm so beloved there...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...........I've never heard of you.
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey you, Mr. Flatfoot. You've heard of me, right?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
This is the first time, pal.
</line><line>Debeste:
...Oh well, It can't be helped. There's no way someone who's so thick on the intake could have good ears.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Don't you mean "slow on the uptake"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
I suppose it's only natural as Sebastian only became a prosecutor last month.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He's just a rookie prosecutor!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Right. <textEffects>The Best</textEffects> rookie prosecutor in the office...
</line><line>Courtney:
...Or so he plans to be.
</line><line>Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. I'm here to clean up the mess you made.
</line><line>Kay:
What do you mean!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The P.I.C. intends to have me replaced... That much is clear.)</textEffects> ...Mr. Debeste. I know what you're trying to say. However, I have not been informed of this. Your Honor. I would like an explanation.
</line><line>Courtney:
Very well. This judgment has been passed under the name of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. <textEffects>The incident at the president's welcoming event</textEffects>, and the <textEffects>murder of Horace Knightley</textEffects>... The <textEffects>Prosecutorial Investigation Committee</textEffects> has decreed that you will be taken off this case... ...and Sebastian has been appointed to take over the case. ...That's all.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat! You can't just take him off the case like that, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor... I thought I asked for an explanation?
</line><line>Courtney:
The judgement is <textEffects>guilty</textEffects>. The <textEffects>Goddess of Law's</textEffects> verdict is absolute.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I have done nothing to warrant being taken off this case!
</line><line>Courtney:
You don't remember? Very well, in that case I shall remind you of your past crimes. You boarded the president's plane, which was protected by extraterritorial rights... ...and then, of all things, you ordered a search of the president's personnel.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Courtney:
A single mistake could have sparked an international incident. You crossed the line as a prosecutor... You've gravely overstepped your authority.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'll admit, my actions may have gone against the rules. However, if I had not taken that risk, I'm certain that the truth would never have been found. I have never considered my actions as a mistake!
</line><line>Courtney:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="image"><img alt="ZamvJ" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="192" data-image-name="ZamvJ.png" data-image-key="ZamvJ.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/af/ZamvJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20140726143516" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Courtney:
So, you're saying that as long as the ends justify the means... ...it's alright to ignore the rules. That is an extremely dangerous way of thinking. No one is above the rules. That is the spirit of the law.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but... I cannot accept your way of thinking.
</line><line>Courtney:
I see. That's a shame. Even so... ...the gavel must slam down at the conclusion of a trial. Even if you, or the defense attorney, or the suspect, do not consent to the verdict. All you can do is accept the blessings of the <textEffects>Goddess of Law</textEffects>. Or... will you fight it? And risk losing your badge?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(She means to take my badge if I don't obey.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Awwwww. That's too bad.
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems you understand. Now then, guards. Please proceed.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Hold it right theeeere!
</line><line>Debeste:
Hey, what are you doing! Aren't you supposed to be on our side? You should listen to the new prosecutor in charge.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ehh! I don't wanna work for you, pal!
</line><line>Debeste:
But, isn't that the job of a flatfoot?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(We're at an overwhelming disadvantage here... It's useless to resist any longer.)</textEffects> Detective Gumshoe! You are now under Mr. Debeste's authority.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-But that's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your Honor.
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes? What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This does not mean I have accepted your decision. We will meet again.
</line><line>Courtney:
Certainly... I look forward to that day.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's go, Kay!
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah...!
</line><line>Ray:
Wait. Don't forget. I'll be reporting today's events to "that person."

You're not going to give up on this case, are you?

No. I don't plan on backing down, not with the current situation as it is. If I were to silently stand by, that would only validate their claims. <textEffects>(But I no longer have investigation rights. What should I do now?)</textEffects> What is it, Detective Gumshoe?

</line><line>Kay:
Let's get going! Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Even if I can't investigate, meeting with the suspect should not be an issue.)</textEffects> Alright, we're heading over to the detention center now.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>I'll also head over on the double, sir!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Detective. Won't that interfere with your job?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>I gotta investigate the scene of the crime anyway, so it should be OK, sir!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Alright. We'll meet up with you there.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Roger, sir!</textEffects>
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Let's go, Kay!
</line><line>Kay:
OK!

</line><line>Kay:
.......... ...He's not coming, is he?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's not.
</line><line>Kay:
It's happening all over again!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Don't joke about that.
</line><line>???:
No way! I mean it! It's not happening!
</line><line>Guard:
Yes. It's happening alright! There's just someone here to talk to you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hm...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
That sounds like a pretty screechy voice, huh?
</line><line>???:
Nowaynowaynoway...!
</line><line>Guard:
Don't be so stubborn!
</line><line>???:
But aren't prosecutors crazy scary or something? Always giving you a death glare!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Um, pardon me, but would you happen to be the suspect...?
</line><line>???:
Aaaaahhh! I knew ittt!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay, why does this man seem so distraught?
</line><line>Kay:
Well, because you're, uh, you!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That doesn't help me at all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hello, Mr. Suspect!
</line><line>???:
!
</line><line>Kay:
Would you mind talking to us for a little bit?
</line><line>???:
Wh-Who are you?
</line><line>Kay:
I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Well, it's just a part-time job. I'm just taking a vacation from my real job!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...I don't remember hiring you.
</line><line>Kay:
This is Mr. Edgeworth. He's a prosecutor, but he's not as scary as he looks, so it's OK.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmph. How rude...!)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
R-Really?
</line><line>Kay:
Really! Really!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Really.
</line><line>???:
Eek!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Kay:
Anyway, can you tell us your name, Mr. Suspect?
</line><line>Simon:
...Yeah. Uh... I-I'm Simon Keyes...
</line><line>Kay:
Nice to meet you, Simon! You can just call me "Kay", 'kay?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor. I would appreciate a word with you.
</line><line>Simon:
...!
</line><line>Kay:
Please! It's for your own good, Simon!
</line><line>Simon:
...Really?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Finally. It looks like we'll be able to get something out of him, thanks to Kay.)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
So, why were you arrested? <textEffects>(Hm, I guess he still won't respond to me...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
........W-Well, I don't know.
</line><line>Kay:
Looks like he's finally warming up to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Whew, that's a great help.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Simon:
This morning, a police officer barged into my house... And before I knew it, he had brought me here...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Was there a prosecutor accompanying him at that time?
</line><line>Simon:
Ahh. I remember a prosecutor called Du-um... Best or something was there too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So, it was that rookie prosecutor...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Then, I guess the police haven't dragged you into questioning yet, huh?
</line><line>Simon:
A-Are the p-police going to interrogate me?
</line><line>Kay:
Yup. That's right. Because you're the suspect.
</line><line>Simon:
Nowaynowaynowaynoway...! Aren't detectives like crazy abusive or something? Always bossing you around with their big bodies!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Detective Gumshoe is on the scene!
</line><line>Simon:
Aaaaaaaaahhhhh! I knew ittttt! Please don't beat me with your thick arms! I can't take it anymore! Someone call the police!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
....... What's gotten into him, sir?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well... It's because you're you, Detective.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get it, sir...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kay:
I know Simon has to be innocent, Mr. Edgeworth! Can't we do something...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Simon Keyes.
</line><line>Simon:
Y-Y-Y-Yes!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You were Mr. Knightley's best friend. You only just met with him two days ago... You say you didn't kill him. Are you certain about this?
</line><line>Simon:
......Y-Yes, I am. I-I wouldn't harm a fly!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. That's enough for me. I shall offer my assistance in proving your innocence.
</line><line>Simon:
Eh! Wh-What's the point in helping little ol' me?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It's not just for you. This case, I have a personal stake in it as well.
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! We gotta get back at those two from yesterday!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm fired up, sir!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, I don't have any investigation rights at the moment. Since I won't be able to obtain information myself, your role is most vital. I'm sure we can rely on you to fill in any holes in the information we have. Help us help you... That's all I ask.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Ah! I just had an idea! Why don't you just borrow a defense attorney's badge, sir!
</line><line>Kay:
Come on! There's no way Mr. Edgeworth could do that. This isn't the time to be joking around!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
B-But I wasn't joking... Helping the suspect is a defense attorney's job, pal...
</line><line>Kay:
Jeez. Don't worry about that! It doesn't matter what Mr. Edgeworth's job is. All we gotta do is find the real murderer! So, let's get movin'!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
OK, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sure you understand, but if the investigation results prove that you are the murderer... No hard feelings, but I will show no mercy...
</line><line>Simon:
Eeeeeee...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, you don't need to be scared. I believe in your story... At least for now.
</line><line>Simon:
........
</line><line>Edgeworth:
All you need to do is believe in us and wait patiently... There's nothing to fear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be off.

<line>Kay:
...So, we're all fired up and ready to go. But we still can't enter the part of the prison where the murder occurred...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
If you can't investigate, the only thing you can do now is defend him in court, sir.
</line><line>Kay:
But how are we supposed to do that? We can't!
</line><line>Ray:
Huh? If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth and his merry gang. What are you guys doing here?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Did you come here to harass Mr. Edgeworth again, pal?
</line><line>Ray:
He he he. What're you talking about, big guy? Uncle Ray's just here to do his job.
</line><line>Kay:
Your job? Oh yeah, you're a defense attorney, right?
</line><line>Ray:
Oh, Kay! You're as cute-iful as ever!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Cute-iful...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
I might not look like it, but your Uncle Ray's a hotshot defense attorney. I'm here to meet with a new client today. What was his name again? <textEffects>Shy Monkees</textEffects> or something...
</line><line>Kay:
What? You mean Simon Keyes?
</line><line>Ray:
That's it! Kay! Looks like you know the deal.
</line><line>Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! He's the defense attorney!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I thought as much. Guess we have no choice but to resort to <span style="color:#E16935">that method</textEffects>. In the past, whenever I had to investigate cases I was not placed in charge of... ...I was able to gain access by becoming a <textEffects>subordinate</textEffects> to whomever was in charge.

</line><line>Ray:
By the way... I don't take on sidekicks.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
!
</line><line>Ray:
I refuse to take on male assistants who lack charm. Especially... Someone who was like a son to Von Karma.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Shields... As I thought, he won't forgive me so easily.)</textEffects> Mr. Shields. I understand that you cannot forgive me for what I've done. I am also fully aware of your hatred towards those involved with Von Karma. I don't know if you'll believe me, but... ...I am no longer the same as I was back then... Back when I idolized Von Karma.
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal! Mr. Edgeworth is a changed man! Sure, he may have been a cruel, inhuman prosecutor in the past... ...but now, he's completely different, pal!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(When you put it that bluntly, it kind of hurts...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
That's right! Mr. Edgeworth's not a bad guy anymore! I wouldn't even call him a prosecutor! He's more like... Uh... Umm... A hero! Yeah! He even helped me out in that big case last month!
</line><line>Ray:
A hero... That's some pretty big talk there, missy.
</line><line>Kay:
He's a magnificent hero! Although he'd be no match for a Great Thief like me!
</line><line>Ray:
......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, don't the actions of the <textEffects>P.I.C.</textEffects> appear... strange to you? I believe there may be something else hidden behind this case. I can't afford to... quit at this juncture! Please let me help you with the investigation. I am begging you.
</line><line>Ray:
...... ...Heh. I never expected you to grovel like this. It sure looks like you've changed, alright. And I'm kinda interested... in the cause of all this.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You're interested... in what changed me? If I had to say, it would probably be... the courtroom itself. All the experiences I've had and all the people I've met inside the courtroom. And perhaps... Reuniting with my old friends.
</line><line>Ray:
...... He he he... I never expected you of all people to change. Who would've thought that you'd lay open your heart like that. I'm sure <textEffects>that man</textEffects> would be surprised as well. Guess I can't turn you away. It may be long overdue... But allow me to properly reintroduce myself. If you would be so kind as to read this...
</line><line>Gumshoe:
<textEffects>Edgeworth Law Offices Raymond Shields, Head Attorney</textEffects>...?
</line><line>Kay:
E-Edgeworth...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields was an assistant to my deceased father... Gregory Edgeworth.
</line><line>Kay:
Really? Your father was a defense attorney? S-So that means <textEffects>that man</textEffects> Mr. Shields talked about is...
</line><line>Ray:
Correct, my cute little Kay. Prosecutor Edgeworth's old man. I never changed the name of the firm. It's my way of showing my appreciation for his help. Prosecutor Edgeworth. No, wait... Miles. Uncle Ray doesn't fully trust you just yet. It may have been temporary, but the fact remains: you were once a disciple of Von Karma. You say that you've changed, but you'll need to prove it to me with your actions. Even your old man... Would've wanted it this way.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Yes, I understand.
</line><line>Ray:
Alright. I'm getting tired of all this stuffy talk, so let's give it a rest and move on... For now, I'll make you my temporary assistant. How does that sound?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm sorry to trouble you...
</line><line>Ray:
But... this outcome is kinda moving, yeah? The prodigal son returning to work in his late father's law firm.
</line><line>Kay:
What about me! What about me!
</line><line>Ray:
Of course, you can help too, Kay.
</line><line>Kay:
Alright! Thanks a lot, Mr. Shields! I mean, Boss!
</line><line>Ray:
Now then, let's get right to work. Let's see.. First off... What do you think we should do, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's right... I had some unfinished business yesterday.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Ray:
Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...but rather, it was <textEffects>the first person to discover the body</textEffects> who screamed.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Why don't we find them and listen to what they have to say?
</line><line>Ray:
Yeah, that's it! Uncle Ray thinks so, too.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmph. Upbeat as always.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
OK! With that decided, let's hurry up and grill him!
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Um... Sir, what am I supposed to do? Detectives can't help defense attorneys!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm... I can't just leave him be...)</textEffects> Detective, I will give you a special assignment. I want you to assist Mr. Debeste in his investigation and follow his orders. And then, if you discover anything useful, I want you to share it with us. Detective. This is a job that only you can do. Can we count on you?
</line><line>Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Leave it to me! I'm really good at leaking investigation reports to defense attorneys!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Normally, that would be a problem for me, but it may come in handy this time.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Alright, let's get moving, shall we? Time to go to jail!
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>March 28, 11:50 AMPrisonHallway</textEffects></captions>
<line>Ray:
Now then, where's the person who first discovered the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
For now, all we can do is ask around.
</line><line>???:
Hold it right there!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Who is this woman?)</textEffects> Umm... Excuse me, but...
</line><line>???:
Oh, you are simply irresistible!
</line><line>Ray:
Huh? Do you mean... me?
</line><line>???:
Very nice, very nice, indeed! What an elegant mustache.
</line><line>Ray:
It's a pleasure to meet you, mademoiselle. Defense attorney Ray Shields, at your service. How about we exchange greetings with a hug?
</line><line>???:
Oh ho ho ho. But of course.
</line><line>Ray:
Mmf! Mmmmmmmf! Uncle Ray's... l-lips...
</line><line>???:
A proper greeting should begin with a hug AND a kiss!
</line><line>Kay:
It's almost like... it was stolen from him!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes, a remarkable feat of quickness that would put a Great Thief to shame.
</line><line>???:
I feel that close contact is very important. This goes for my family here in my <textEffects>home</textEffects> as well.
</line><line>Ray:
Q-Quite a splendid way of thinking there. He he he.
</line><line>Roland:
I am the warden, Patricia Roland. But please, just call me Patty.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The warden...? So she's in charge of the prison and detention center?)</textEffects> Nice to meet you. I am Miles Edgeworth. I'm a prosec... I mean, I'm Mr. Shield's assistant. Pardon me for asking, but were you here in the prison yesterday?
</line><line>Roland:
But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
"Wouldn't have missed for the world"? Did you have some kind of important meeting...?
</line><line>Roland:
Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the <textEffects>Animal Show</textEffects>, of course! A wonderful spectacle, featuring animals dancing and flying through the air! I always see it along with everyone else in our <textEffects>home</textEffects>! We're one big, happy family! We built a special stage in the courtyard just for this performance.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(A performance for the prisoners' enjoyment... Yesterday, Elbird mentioned some kind of "recreation"... I suppose the Animal Show was what he was referring to.)</textEffects> When did this show take place?
</line><line>Roland:
It started at 8 AM and ended around 10 AM.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(That's exactly when the body was discovered... So whoever saw the show would probably have an <span style="color:#E16935">alibi</textEffects>.)</span>
</line><line>Roland:
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be going. I have business to attend to. Please take your time and have a look around our <textEffects>home</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kay:
So, where should we start, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There was a prisoner who heard the scream from the person who first discovered the body. Let's start by talking with him.

Is anyone using that workroom right now?

Presently, there is one prisoner working inside! I'm positive he's been there since the noon roll call!

Sorry about that. He he. My assistant says strange things sometimes. He's not a prosecutor, just my assistant. Hey! Get your act together, Miles.

<textEffects>(Hmm, I guess I messed up... I forgot about my "new job".)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
No wonder I thought you were different from the prosecutor who visited me yesterday.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It looks like he's already spoken to Debeste.)</textEffects> May we ask you a few questions?
</line><line>Sahwit:
...Oh, yes. Of course you may. My name is Frank Sahwit.
</line><line>Ray:
OK. Go for it, Miles.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I guess I'll be asking the questions after all... *sigh*...)</textEffects> Mr. Sahwit, you are aware of the murder that occurred here yesterday, correct? Where were you when the body was discovered?
</line><line>Sahwit:
I was... in this room, where I had been working.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What kind of work?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Well, my goal is to become a pet groomer. An animal beautician, so to speak. Oh yes. I was inside cultivating my skills.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(In any other prison, such training would be unheard of...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sahwit:
That was all. Honestly. I-I did not see a thing.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hm? Why did he say that? I haven't even asked him anything yet.)</textEffects>

Which is why, sad to say, I won't be any help to you.

<captions aligned="center"><b>3 CHESS PIECES</b></captions>
<line>Sahwit:
I'm afraid I didn't see a thing. So, I won't be any help to you.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(This man's expressions do not change much. It's a true poker face. It may be difficult to read his emotions from his body language.)</textEffects> Perhaps I should focus on <textEffects>how he phrases his words</textEffects>. It may reveal what's on his mind. Now, for the opening move... I'll start by asking about <textEffects>who this man is</textEffects>. Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure I'll cause a change!
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Begin Logic Chess</textEffects></captions>

<line>Edgeworth:
Are you... involved with this case?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Are you referring to the murder that occurred inside this prison? I had nothing to do with it at all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is that true?
</line><line>Sahwit:
I-I would never dream of being involved in a murder plot. Hm... How should I put it... I'm... an upright, model citizen after all...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Common sense tells me... ...an upright, model citizen would have never ended up behind bars.
</line><line>Sahwit:
W-Well, that is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell me what you know about the incident!
</line><line>Sahwit:
I already told you, I don't know a damn thing! Oh, er... I really don't know anything.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Sahwit:
I apologize from the bottom of my heart for that outburst... But I will be of no assistance.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Pardon my rudeness. It's just that the murder occurred in this rather confined prison. It seems unnatural that you do not know anything about it.
</line><line>Sahwit:
...Oh? Er... U-Unnatural... Is that so? I-If you're looking for the person who discovered the body... You should try someone else...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
How did you know we were looking for the person who discovered the body? I don't recall saying a word about that. Are you sure you don't know anything?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Sahwit:
...! N-No... It was merely a hunch I had. I am but a humble pet groomer in training. I honestly have no recollection of the murder.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I am positive that this man is hiding something. For my next move... I'll ask him about <textEffects>his movements on the day of the murder</textEffects>. This man has suppressed his emotions. I will expose his true nature hidden beneath that suspicious smile!
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
Let's talk about what happened on the day of the murder. If you truly had nothing to do with it, there shouldn't be a problem, correct?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Oh... Well... O-On the day of the murder... There was a lot going on...

<line>Edgeworth:
Someone's voice? Judging from the circumstances, I suppose it was a scream that you heard? So you do have a recollection of the murder! You kept insisting that you knew absolutely nothing about the murder... But you do not give credence to your claims!
</line><line>Sahwit:
Urgh! W-Well, I thought I heard someone's voice but... I-In any case, I don't remember it very well.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The scream at the time of the murder... It might be a <textEffects>clue</textEffects>. I better keep that in mind...

<line>Edgeworth:
Let's try using that <textEffects>clue</textEffects>...
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
You don't remember? Ridiculous. Didn't you say earlier that you heard a scream?
</line><line>Sahwit:
That wasn't... I could very well be mistaken... At any rate, I honestly do not remember.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You still do not remember? Enough with your lies!
</line><line>Sahwit:
I ain't lyin', you...! ...I mean, I'm telling the truth.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
........
</line><line>Sahwit:
In any case... I was absorbed in grooming the animals.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
By the way... How skilled would you say you are in animal grooming?
</line><line>Sahwit:
My techinique with the scissors still needs some work... But I am very confident in my handling of the animals. When the animals became frightened, I calmed them with my gentle hands...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Frightened? Why would the animals have become frightened? I don't think that's a common occurrence...
</line><line>Sahwit:
W-Well... That's a good thing... Isn't it?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps the reason they were frightened was because of someone's scream? Why are you trying so hard to hide the fact that there was a scream! Are you concealing some vital information from me?
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></captions>
<line>Sahwit:
Argh! I-I am doing nothing of the sort! I-It's true that I heard some sort of scream... But I'm not trying to hide it!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He's starting to show his true colors. I should be more aggressive with my next move. I'll ask him <textEffects>about the scream</textEffects>. It's time to give him a taste... ...of the futility of keeping a secret from me!
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Sahwit:
The Animal Show was very enjoyable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What kind of animals performed in the show?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Well... Umm... I believe I saw a whale?
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
You liar! You didn't see the Animal Show at all!
</line><line>Sahwit:
Urgh! W-Well, that is... I sort of saw it, and I sort of didn't...

</line><line>Sahwit:
Urgh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
There's no way out of this! Tell me what really happened! Confess everything you know about the scream!
</line><line>Sahwit:
I cannot answer... What I cannot answer... I-I didn't hear the scream... from the person who discovered the body...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
That's strange. Normally, if you hear a scream during a murder, it's usually from the victim. Why would you think the scream was from the person who discovered the body?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Oh! M-My mistake!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
How? How did you know the scream was from the person who discovered the body?
</line><line>Sahwit:
W-Well... That's because...
</line>



<line>Edgeworth:
Allow me to answer for you. That's because you're the one who discovered the body. And... ...the scream that was heard when the murder occurred didn't come from the victim... It came from you when you discovered the body!

V-Very well, I'll tell you... B-But I doubt my testimony is worth hearing...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Whether or not it is worth hearing is for me to decide. I will expose the truth with my own hands. That is my sole duty.

Umm. I think you're a little off there, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Kay:
We're not trying to expose the truth, we're trying to save Simon! Isn't our goal to help out our clients? I mean, you're not a prosecutor right now, you're a defense attorney's assistant!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Hmm.
</line><line>Ray:
Well said there, Kay! She's right on the money, Miles. The official task of the Edgeworth Law Offices is to defend our clients. Your old man, who founded the firm, truly valued the bonds he had with his clients. So, if you're not willing to do the same, maybe you aren't cut out for this job. I don't wanna fire you on the spot either. So have a heart, OK?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...... <textEffects>(The heart of a defense attorney, huh...)</textEffects> In any case, it's important that we hear the testimony of the person who discovered the body. Start talking, Mr. Sahwit. Tell me what happened when you found the body!

<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- When I Found the Body --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Sahwit:
I was in the workroom over there practicing my skills.
By some chance, I got curious about the adjacent workroom, and went up to the door.
I peeked in through the small window on the door.
Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself letting out a scream.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
If I may confirm one thing... You were in the room... Right next to the one where the dead body was found?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Within the prison, we call it <textEffects>Workroom B</textEffects>.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And were you in there the whole time on the day of the murder?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Yes. After the 7 AM roll call, I remained inside the whole time. In this prison, we have roll call 3 times a day. At 7 AM, noon, and 9 PM.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And they check the workrooms during those times, too?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Exactly.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I see... So during the 7 AM roll call, there was nothing amiss. And Knightley's body was not in the workroom yet...)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Prison Roll Call notes jotted down in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
So it sounds like the murder occurred <textEffects>after 7 AM</textEffects>, huh?
</line><line>Kay:
And that's right when the Animal Show started!
</line><line>Sahwit:
Correct. The other prisoners went to see the Animal Show.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Meaning <textEffects>anyone who did not see the show</textEffects> does not have an alibi... Do you understand what I'm saying, Mr. Sahwit?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Y-Yes, that is certainly true... H-However, I merely discovered the body...

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What about that <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> on your wrist? It proves that you are... unmistakably a prisoner. And as long as you wear that <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects>, you should not be able to move around as you please! As soon as you went through the door, the sensor would have sounded the alarm.
</line><line>Sahwit:
Oh, er... That is...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Peeking into the adjacent room is impossible... When you couldn't even leave the one you were in!
</line><line>Sahwit:
Argh!
</line><line>Ray:
Whoo-wee! Nice one, Miles! That was a real humdinger!
</line><line>Kay:
But does that mean Mr. Sahwit didn't see the body?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I'm not sure. Perhaps... We should let the man himself explain it to us.
</line><line>Sahwit:
Huh? Umm... You see... That is... Well... Forgive me. It appears my previous explanation was lacking... I shall clearly explain how I was able to see the body.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very well, let us hear your revised testimony.

<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- When I Found It, Pt. 2 --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Sahwit:
There is a rather well-known technique among the prisoners here...
If the hand with the <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> stays in the room, you can step out without sounding the alarm.
That's how I was able to peek into the adjacent room.
The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Hmm, so that means... He kept his arm inside workroom B, while he peeked into the adjacent room.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sahwit:
I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to everyone. Especially the guards... OK?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Was that what he was trying to hide earlier...? I should try asking him for more details about a few other things as well.)</textEffects>

So you looked into the adjacent room immediately after you heard the noise. If that was true, then you should have seen more than just a dead body. You should have seen the person who had made the noise.
</line><line>Sahwit:
Th-That is... Um... Well...
</line><line>Kay:
He looks really shaken!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit! Answer me! What did you really see?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
If you intend to remain silent... ...I will have no choice but to assume that you are complicit to the murder.
</line><line>Sahwit:
! Oh... Umm... Please forgive me. It's just that I couldn't even believe what I saw myself... It may have been just a dream. I hesitate to even recall it.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Tell me what happened!
</line><line>Sahwit:
Very well... I will be frank with you. I saw a <textEffects>dog</textEffects>. ...It was a nightmarish scene. A large black dog... ...was biting into the neck of the victim!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wha-! What did you say!
</line><line>Sahwit:
It was a truly hellish scene... That dog! That dog killed him!

Ooooooh... I think I'm going to be sick...

That's some Grade A trauma right there...
</line><line>Sahwit:
I was chilled to my very core, and let out a shriek.

<textEffects>(A man-eating dog inside this zoo of a prison...?)</textEffects>

<textEffects>He most likely had passed away already. His hands moved nary an inch...</textEffects>

<textEffects>The ring with the snowflake insignia glimmered, with no purpose but to catch my eye.</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
A ring with a snowflake insignia...?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Yes, that is correct. It was clearly engraved on the surface.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. Your testimony is very accurate, But it's a little TOO accurate, if you ask me.
</line><line>Sahwit:
And what's wrong with being accurate?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You state that you saw a ring with a snowflake insignia engraved into it. And it is true that the victim was wearing such a ring.
</line><line>Sahwit:
See? Was I not correct?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
That is not the issue I have with your testimony. Take a look at this picture! As you can see, the right hand is covered by a sheet. It should not have been possible for you to see the engraving on the ring. Unless you had approached the body and lifted up the sheet for yourself! You said you only looked into the workroom through the door. And yet, you gave such a detailed account of what you saw.
</line><line>Sahwit:
Who do you think you are...? Acting all high and mighty. I-I'm telling you, I saw what I saw! Oh! The victim must have moved his arm after I saw it...

I'm just your friendly neighborhood witness!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Are you really just a witness? I would you say that you are rather suspicious.
</line><line>Sahwit:
What was that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You saw something that could not have been seen from the outside of the room. How is that possible? ...The logic behind it is simple. <textEffects>Mr. Sahwit. This is where you saw the body from!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
When you discovered the body, you went inside the room where it laid! Since you saw the engraving on the ring, that is the only possibility!
</line><line>Sahwit:
.......... Heh... He he! Even if you say that, you ain't got no evidence, do ya? Where's the evidence that shows that I was in that room? I was grooming pets at that time. In the room adjacent to where the body was found! I even went so far as to borrow some rubber gloves! <textEffects>Show me the evidence that proves I was in the room where the body was found!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit, what were you doing when the body was discovered?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Didn't I tell you already? I was practicing being a pet groomer!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see. In that case... Do you happen to recognize this glove?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Oh! Th-That's...!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This was found near the body. It is believed to have been dropped by the culprit. By the way... I noticed that you also have a rubber glove hanging out of your apron pocket...

N-No, this is... something else!

</line><line>Sahwit:
..........

</line><line>Ray:
Not so fast, Mr. Prisoner. Could you fill us in?
</line><line>Sahwit:

</line><line>Ray:
That's pretty weird. The <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> should have been his last line of defense.
</line><line>Kay:
Defense?
</line><line>Ray:
That's right, Kay. It was useful evidence for Mr. Prisoner here. He could have claimed that due to the <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects>, he wasn't able to enter the room... But, he didn't say a word about it. Is there any reason why you didn't?
</line><line>Sahwit:
..........
</line><line>Ray:

</line><line>Kay:
W-Wow... You really are a hotshot defense attorney, Mr. Shields!
</line><line>Ray:
Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger. That's what your old man taught me. The <textEffects>Defense Attorney's Creed</textEffects>, yeah? ...So, what's the deal? Why didn't you mention anything about the <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects>?
</line><line>Sahwit:
.......... ...The truth is... It's broken.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Broken?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sahwit:
Some time ago, I took a spill and the <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> hit the floor with a loud bang. Ever since then, it was not been able to activate the sensor. Forgive me. It was so convenient, I didn't want to report it...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I see... So the <textEffects>bracelet</textEffects> was broken. <textEffects>(But did it really break so easily? If that is true, then there is a problem with the prison's security.)</textEffects>

But all I did was find the body! Honest! And it is true that I saw the dog biting his neck! However, I entered the workroom after the dog had left...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Why did you do that?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Well, it was just... I was curious if he had anything of value on him...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(So he was planning to loot the corpse. That's why he remembers Knightley's ring so well.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Why are you looking at me, Mr. Edgeworth!? I am a GREAT Thief! Please don't put me on the same level as him!
</line><line>Sahwit:
But! I didn't take a thing! The Animal Show had ended and the other prisoners were making their way back down here. I hurried back to my workroom, and let out a scream to deceive the others.
</line><line>Ray:
And that's when you dropped your rubber glove.

<line>Ray:
I guess his story holds up. What do you think, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Whether he is the murderer or not, one big question remains. How did Knightley get all the way from his holding cell to the prison?
</line><line>Ray:
You're right about that. It's a real stumper.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And there's something Mr. Sahwit said in his testimony that I'm very concerned about. <textEffects>(If that dog had any part in the murder...)</textEffects> Mr. Sahwit.
</line><line>Sahwit:
Y-Y-Yes! What is it?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Were there any other prisoners who didn't see the Animal Show?
</line><line>Sahwit:
...Yes. There is only one other that I know of.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
And this prisoner wouldn't have been able to see the show even if he wanted to. Correct?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Y-Yes, that's correct. Why do you ask?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Just as I thought... I had my suspicions as soon as I saw that black dog. That fiendish criminal... I never expected him to be held here in this prison.)</textEffects> Where is his cell...?
</line><line>Sahwit:
Err... Do you intend to meet him?
</line><line>Kay:
Him...? Who's him?
</line><line>Sahwit:
He's a very special man. He receives very special treatment, and... ...Oh, forgive me. I need to watch what I say about him. However... If you value your lives, I would advise you to stay away from him.
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! C-Cut it out already! You're giving me the creeps!
</line><line>Ray:
Hm, a puppet master in the shadows, huh? Yeah... I still value my life...
</line><line>Sahwit:
He is being held in the <textEffects>special cell</textEffects>. Over there... In that direction...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">special cell</textEffects>...? It certainly seems like he receives special treatment.)</span>
</line><line><textEffects>Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Well, so just who is this "him" anyway?
</line><line>Sahwit:
...To protect my own life, all I can tell you is that he is the oldest prisoner here. My deepest apologies... But I can't say anymore... He is truly terrifying!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Ray:
Care to fill me in? It feels like you're leaving Uncle Ray behind here.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He is someone I knew in the past... Let's head for the <textEffects>special cell</textEffects>. I believe that black dog should be there as well.

Hey, it's pitch black in here... I can't see a thing at all!

Aren't you always talking about how the Yatagarasu is able to flap even in the darkest night?
</line><line>Kay:
Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, <textEffects>Yatagarasu</textEffects>!

It has been far too long.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
So you still remember me?
</line><line>???:
Keh heh, it would be impossible to forget. Because it was you who did what none could do... ...and place me here in this cell.
</line><line>Kay:
Um... Don't tell me that the dog is talking to you, Mr. Edgeworth.
</line><line>Ray:
Is there someone else there? I can't see anything though...
</line><line>Dogen:
Down boy. It is rude to frighten the visitors. Here. Allow me to illuminate this dark room. Keh heh heh... Such noisy visitors. From the voices and footsteps... Two more in the back. But it would be rude not to introduce myself. I am called Sirhan Dogen. Mr. Edgeworth and I... We are old acquaintances. Keh heh heh...

<textEffects>(This man is a former <span style="color:#E16935">assassin</textEffects>.)</span> The blind assassin... Sirhan Dogen. His weapons are sharp knives and a ferocious dog.

Would you be so kind as to share the reason why you have come, Mr. Edgeworth?

Keh heh heh. It seems we know each other quite well.

<line>Edgeworth:
Do you know who was murdered?
</line><line>Dogen:
It was Horace Knightley. A most unfortunate lad.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Your ears are as sharp as ever.
</line><line>Dogen:
They are all I can rely on.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As I thought, he has full knowledge of everything that goes on in this prison.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
On second thought, he might be fortunate after all.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Fortunate? How so?
</line><line>Dogen:
He committed a grave crime, but he was able to avoid punishment for it. An <textEffects>assassination attempt on the president</textEffects>... What a bold man.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Assassination attempt?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
Hey! Mr. Edgeworth! Didn't Mr. Knightley just...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
He may have killed his own superior, but he never attempted to take the president's life. <textEffects>(Are they trying to conceal the fact the assassination was staged by the president?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses. Knightley didn't attack the president? But Uncle Ray was requested to defend him in court on charges of <textEffects>attempted assassination</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
You didn't know either, Uncle Ray? So, they're trying to pin the whole thing on Mr. Knightley...?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Now I see why the <textEffects>P.I.C.</textEffects> is taking action.
</line><line>Kay:
Ah! So that's why they removed you from the case...
</line><line>Ray:
That DaPest guy was going to indict him on charges of <textEffects>attempted assassination</textEffects>.
</line><line>Kay:
And in doing so, they would have twisted the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>!
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I suspected it was a false charge.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
?
</line><line>Dogen:
I heard about it from one of the guards. About Knightley... He kept desperately insisting, "I didn't assassinate anyone!"
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...But the courts are supposed to bring the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> to light.
</line><line>Dogen:
I may not be well-versed in law, but I can say one thing for certain. Some of the prisoners here were convicted on false charges.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
</line><line>Dogen:
...That's the reality of it. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? Leaving the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> in the care of the court can be dangerous.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Leaving the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</textEffects> in the care of the court is dangerous... Huh. There was someone who said the exact same thing before... That investigator from Interpol who doesn't trust prosecutors.)</span>

<line>Lang:
<textEffects>You're not twisting the truth behind those closed courtroom doors, too, are you? Fueled by those ideas, is it any wonder that courts produce nothing but falsities and lies!? Rest assured, the next time we meet, I won't be so forgiving.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I doubt his distrust has cleared up completely...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
Keh heh heh... You feel the same way, don't you, Anubis? The <textEffects>truth</textEffects> of the courts and Mr. Edgeworth's reasoning both can't be trusted. Right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
</line><line>Dogen:
It is nothing to be upset about. You're not the only one who suspects me. Yesterday, the other prosecutor and that judge came here too. They brought the warden along. How they despise me.
</line><line>Kay:
Oh! It must have been those two rude people from before!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Prosecutor Debeste and Judge Courtney...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Dogen:
They thoroughly inspected my room, but left without finding a thing. Keh heh heh. It seems they were searching for the murder weapon. 'Tis a shame. They searched the other prisoners' cells too. Not just mine. Yet they were still unable to find anything. All that hard work was for naught. Keh heh heh.

</line><line>Dogen:
Now, if my guests would be so kind as to leave... Right, Anubis? Show them the way out.
</line><line>Ray:
Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?

L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!

Beats me... He just took off running like death was after him.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Good grief. That man...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
What should we do now, Mr. Edgeworth?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
We'll continue investigating. <textEffects>(First, we should... ...start by solving that one mystery. Knightley's body was found in a workroom inside the prison. However... ...he was supposed to be in the detention center's holding cell...

<textEffects>(Hm? What happened? That's the warden, Ms. Roland. She must have come from behind that "No entry" sign.)</textEffects>

So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...
</line><line>Roland:
That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...

That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Did he just say "assassin"...!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Roland:
Oh my.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Pardon me, but... Were you talking about Sirhan Dogen just now?
</line><line>Roland:
Oh, eavesdropping, were you? You naughty boy!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Did you question him personally, Warden Roland?
</line><line>Roland:
Not just him. I try to have a heart-to-heart with all the prisoners and suspects. In my <textEffects>home</textEffects>, we're all family here! It's only fair I invite them to my <textEffects>Warden's Office</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

Oh, have you taken an interest in my room as well? It's just down this hallway. But outsiders are not allowed past this point.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Down the hallway... So around there...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Roland:
Hu hu hu. It's such a lovely room. People do enjoy being invited back here. I always show them the splendid view of my precious courtyard!

Are these the chess pieces from Dogen's cell? I don't know much about the rules of chess...

The rules of chess are not important here. Look at the positions of the chess pieces in this memo and the pieces in Dogen's cell... Do you notice anything?

Hah. Our president doesn't even trust his own country's police force. Look at the results of hiring a private security company. It's laughable.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Agent Lang doesn't trust prosecutors or the courts. That's why... ...he brings along a large force of capable policemen to thoroughly investigate the crime scene.)</textEffects> Yes. If you and your subordinates had been there, the results might have been different.

Ooh! There you are!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. Where did you go?
</line><line>Ray:
Where indeed! I've been searching for you guys this whole time! Walking all around the prison is hard work, you know!
</line><line>Kay:
...That's strange, seeing as you came from the opposite direction.
</line><line>Ray:
.......... I've got some new information. You wanna hear it? Do you!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He sure changed the subject quickly.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ray:
I heard a little something from the guards. It seems Knightley caused a bit of an incident two days ago.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
An incident?
</line><line>Ray:
You know how Simon said he came to visit Knightley, right? After the visit, when Knightley returned to his cell... Naturally, a guard escorted Knightley back to his cell. While the guard was unlocking his handcuffs... All of a sudden, Knightley struck the guard and knocked him out. It seems he was going to attempt a jailbreak. By the time the other guards arrived, the key to his cell had disappeared.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
But, there's been no reports of Knightley's jailbreak attempt two days ago...
</line><line>Ray:
Exactly. It's strange, isn't it. Right up until his death, he was still in his cell. What's more, Knightley claimed he never stole the key in the first place. In fact, they searched his cell, and the key was nowhere to be found...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Did the guard who was struck have anything to say?
</line><line>Ray:
No one knows. He was taken to the hospital while he was still unconscious. He's still there now, it seems.

</line><line>Courtney:
I know. You are Simon Keyes' defense attorney, are you not?
</line><line>Ray:
Well then, let's skip the formalities, and celebrate our happy reunion with a hug... O-Or maybe not!
</line><line>Courtney:
Incidentally... I heard you mention an assistant a moment ago.
</line><line>Kay:
Yeah! We're assistants at the Edgeworth Law Offices!
</line><line>Courtney:
Prosecutors are civil servants, to open a side business is to betray the Goddess of Law.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
As long as profit is not our objective, there shouldn't be a problem, right?
</line><line>Ray:
Y-Yeah, that's it! Miles here is a volunteer worker! The purpose of my office isn't to make money... We're pro bono.
</line><line>Courtney:
What a wonderful heart you have. Defending others without demanding payment.
</line><line>Ray:
Ah... Aha ha ha... I-I do have an amazing charitable heart.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
More importantly, I'd like you to explain your reasons for arresting Simon Keyes.
</line><line>Courtney:
There's no need to...
</line><line>Debeste:
Is that a challenge against me!?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
No, I was speaking with Judge Courtney...
</line><line>Debeste:
I guess it can't be helped. If you want to take on <textEffects>The Best</textEffects>, you will fall like the rest!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(I haven't said anything yet. ...But this is convenient.)</textEffects> Then I will hear you out. What were your reasons for arresting Mr. Keyes?
</line><line>Courtney:
I see no need to inform you. Sebastian, let us...
</line><line>Debeste:
Heh heh heh... Just watch, Justine. Watch as I run around in circles against this useless prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(*sigh*... This guy sure talks a lot.)</textEffects> ...So, you're the one who arrested Mr. Keyes, I take it... Mr. Debeste. Do you have the right to do such a thing?
</line><line>Debeste:
Well, obviously it was the police who carried out the arrest. But, since it was under my direction, shouldn't it also count as my arrest?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(As I expected... It'd be difficult to deal with both of them at the same time. However... Her silence is troubling me. Just what is she thinking?)</textEffects>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>Obviously, we had a fatal reason for arresting Simon!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>The answer is simple. Yes. We found "traces" of that guy over there.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>The victim carried a chessboard. From it, we found Simon Keyes' fingerprints.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right?</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>The other prints belonged to the victim and the guards. Yes, only Simon's prints are unnatural!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Debeste:
<textEffects>My reasoning is faster than light. It'd take you a light year to get it. In short, I am the Best!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
........ <textEffects>(What is he saying...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
It's really vague and hard to understand...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
First, I'll have to teach him how to speak a language people can understand.
</line><line>Kay:
Teach it to him, Professor Edgeworth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
Fingerprints found on the chessboard... Is that the ace up your sleeve?
</line><line>Debeste:
Ace in my sleeve? ...Oh! Ace up my sleeve...!? Yes! The methods I use are always "The Best". This ace is my trump card!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Well then, allow me to show you that it is not, in fact, a trump card at all. Simon Keyes was the one who sent this chessboard to the victim in the first place... So, it's only natural some of his prints would be left on it.
</line><line>Debeste:
.......... Aaaaagh!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...That took way too long.)</textEffects> These fingerprints are hardly decisive evidence. Perhaps your arrest was a little too rash?
</line><line>Debeste:
Rash......
</line><line>Edgeworth:
To begin with, this incident occurred in the detention center and the prison. To suspect Simon just because he isn't a prisoner or a guard is a little unreasonable...
</line><line>Debeste:
Aaaaaah!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Wh-What? <textEffects>(What's with him all of a sudden...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Wah hah hah hah. I finally get what you're trying to say. Rash... You mean we were too quick to arrest the guy, right?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(He was stuck on that!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Sure, I was the first to lay eyes on him. And I was the first to notice the evidence. That was even faster. But, I am not rash! Sure, Simon Keyes isn't a guard or a prisoner. But...

Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the "Best" part first?
</line><line>Debeste:
The "Best" part...!
</line><line>Courtney:
Why don't you tell them? About your wonderful reasoning regarding the murder weapon.
</line><line>Debeste:
.....Good one, Justine. Nice suggestion. Mr. Edgeworth, listen to my first-rate reasoning!

</line><line>Edgeworth:
Will this reasoning explain why you arrested Mr. Keyes?
</line><line>Debeste:
I'm sure it will meet your expectations.

<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>-- Murder Weapon's Location --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Debeste:
It's obvious the murder weapon was a sharp metal object!
However, the prison maintains strict control over potentially lethal items.
So... That's why I've reasoned that the murder weapon was brought in from the outside.
Yes. It was hidden inside that chess board.
And since only the victim and the suspect's fingerprints were found on the chessboard...
Isn't it obvious who brought and used the murder weapon?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(At least it's clearer than his last testimony...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
It's <textEffects>Debeste</textEffects> reasoning you can get from Prosecutor The Best. How do you like that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Now he's mixing up "<span style="color:#E16935">the best</textEffects>" with his own name...)</span>
</line><line>Kay:
But, could someone really hide a weapon inside a gift sent to a prisoner?
</line><line>Debeste:
He he. You'll find a good place if you examine the inside of the chessboard.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Inside the chessboard? Is there some place to hide a weapon...)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
As I thought, there are only chess pieces inside.
</line><line>Debeste:
He he he...
</line><line>Kay:
Wow. What an annoying laugh...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Inside the chessboard, huh. Perhaps I should examine it a bit further.)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Edgeworth:
This is...! <textEffects>(The top panel is removable.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kay:
It's quite deep.

Yes. There's more than enough room to hide a small knife.

Hmph......
</line><line>Debeste:
Hmph! What's with the "hmph"! I wasn't even finished!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Mr. Debeste, there is something you have forgotten. There's a gate at the entrance of the detention center!
</line><line>Debeste:
...Eh? Well, there is, but...
</line><line>Courtney:
He means the security gates with the metal detectors, Sebastian. We had to pass through the same check when we entered the prison, remember?
</line><line>Debeste:
Ah... Aaaah! Yeah! That's it! I remember now!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(It looks like he completely forgot.)</textEffects> It would be impossible to smuggle a sharp metal object into the detention center. Therefore, your reasoning never held, even from the very beginning!

</line><line>Courtney:
That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...So they don't use a metal detector for that?

This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.

<line>Kay:
That last testimony sure seemed like faulty reasoning.

Judge Courtney helped him out... No, the argument was entirely her own reasoning.
</line><line>Ray:
In that case, this'll be tough. Got anything up your sleeve, Miles?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Of course. They don't know all the facts. This reasoning doesn't appear to have any weak points at first glance, but...

But on closer inspection, there is a hole, right?

The murder weapon is hidden inside the prison? ...I don't think so. It's clear from this piece of evidence. <textEffects>(What shows that the murder weapon can't be inside the prison?)</textEffects>

<line>Edgeworth:
Have you completely forgotten your own actions? You, along with Warden Roland, conducted a search of the prison. But, you did not find the murder weapon, right?
</line><line>Debeste:
Th-That's..... We must have overlooked something!

Oh, in that case, Kay Faraday is far, <textEffects>Farahead</textEffects>!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Kay, don't you get caught up in this too!
</line><line>Debeste:
Yes. If my best investigation didn't find anything... ...then there must not have been a single weapon in the prison! In that case, there's only one possibility! The criminal must have taken the murder weapon with him when he left the prison! So it's only natural we didn't find it in there. Yeah.

</line><line>Edgeworth:
There was no way that the culprit could have brought the weapon out of the prison! <textEffects>And this piece of evidence shows why!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Have you completely forgotten your own testimony?
</line><line>Debeste:
Y-You! That's twice you've insulted me!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Oh? It seems you remember what I said earlier. But you'd do well to remember further than that.
</line><line>Debeste:
...! What is that!?
</line><line>Kay:
Th-This guy, he really doesn't remember anything?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
It seems that way... The detention center and the prison are equipped with security gates. Anyone leaving must pass through these gates. Gates... equipped with metal detectors.
</line><line>Debeste:
Aaaah! That's what you...!
</line><line>Kay:
Looks like he remembers now.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Yes. There's no way someone could have brought the murder weapon through those gates. And so the criminal could not have taken it out of the prison either!
</line><line>Debeste:
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Courtney:
So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Do you know where this murder weapon went to?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Perhaps the weapon is still inside the prison?
</line><line>Debeste:
But, we couldn't find it anywhere in the prison!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
The reason you didn't find it... ...is because you believed it to be a sharp metal object.
</line><line>Kay:
We saw the very moment when Mr. Knightley was attacked, after all!
</line><line>Courtney:
If you can say that much, then perhaps you could enlighten us. What would you say is the murder weapon in this case?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
From this piece of evidence, the murder weapon of this case becomes obvious.
</line>


<line>Edgeworth:
Here is footage from a security camera. It shows one of the cells in the detention center... See it with your own eyes!
</line><line>Debeste:
What! Th-This is! It can't be!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
This tape clearly shows the moment the victim was attacked by a black dog. I believe this is sufficient proof, wouldn't you say?
</line><line>Courtney:
...Indeed, this is vital evidence.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley was killed in the detention center, by that dog! After that, the body was moved to the prison workroom. Our witness claims to have seen a dog in the workroom when the body was found. Of course, a dog couldn't have planned this crime on its own. However, there is someone who could have...

...That's enough. Prosecutor Edgeworth.

It's true this camera footage is vital evidence. However, there is something else you must prove. Actually, you've already noticed it, haven't you?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(...It's just as she says. There is still a huge flaw in my reasoning.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
If that black dog is a prisoner's pet... ...how was it able to move between the detention center and prison?
</line><line>Debeste:
......Ah!
</line><line>Kay:
What will we do, Mr. Edgeworth!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
I still don't know how the dog managed to move from one place to the other...

What! You're one to talk! You don't know either!

Just as I don't know how the dog entered the detention center... ...you also don't know how Simon Keyes entered the detention center and prison. Although he came to visit the victim, he was an outsider to the prison. Don't you think it would be difficult for him to commit a crime inside the prison?

</line><line>Edgeworth:
What?! <textEffects>(Does she really have evidence?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
It's about time I told you. Now that I know the basis of your reasoning, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(What is she thinking?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Courtney:
It seems you don't even know Simon Keyes' real occupation... He is a circus performer.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
A c-circus performer?
</line><line>Courtney:
Yes. Have you ever heard of the <textEffects>Berry Big Circus</textEffects>?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Circus... Aaaaah!

<line>Roland:
But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!
</line><line>Edgeworth:

</line><line>Roland:
Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the <textEffects>Animal Show</textEffects>, of course!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Courtney:
It seems you've realized. On the day of the incident, an Animal Show was being performed at the prison. And the show was put on by the Berry Big Circus.
</line><line>Kay:
S-So then! Do you mean, Simon is...
</line><line>Courtney:
Simon Keyes entered the prison as a staff member of the Animal Show. That, we know for a fact.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
N-Nuguoooooh! <textEffects>(Th-This woman! She's been concealing this fact the whole time! She only planned to reveal it after hearing my reasoning! Come to think of it...)</textEffects>

<line>Debeste:
Wh-What are you doing Justine! Don't butt in like that.
</line><line>Courtney:
Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the "Best" part first?

<line>Edgeworth:
<textEffects>(Mr. Debeste was going to say it then, but she stopped him!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Debeste:
Wah hah hah hah! How do you like that, worthless prosecutor!
</line><line>Edgeworth:
You didn't do anything!
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then, now it really is time for a recess. I'll end with some advice. I had already doubted your abilities as a prosecutor... ...which is why I relieved you of your authority. You'd best not forget that...
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...What are you trying to say?
</line><line>Courtney:
The P.I.C. can still take away your badge. If you value your badge, I'd advise you not to show your face before me again.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Is that a threat?
</line><line>Courtney:
The Goddess of Law is merciful, but that doesn't mean you can get away with everything. And one more thing... I must digress. I suggest you stop with this defense attorney act.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...That's none of your concern. I don't intend to abandon a case I am involved in so easily.
</line><line>Courtney:
For defense attorneys, a relationship of mutual trust with their client is vital. It is very different from the way of the prosecutor... In any case... you didn't even know about your client's occupation.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
Ngh!
</line><line>Courtney:
Well then, I must be going. May the blessings of the Goddess of Law be upon you.
</line><line>Kay:
Did Simon... lie to us...?
</line><line>Ray:
It seems he lied to Uncle Ray too. This complicates matters. Why'd he do that?
</line><line>Edgeworth:
......
</line><line>Ray:
Hey, hey, Miles. Don't tell me you've got cold feet already? Courtney-pie is quite a handful, but giving up is still uncool. A defense attorney's creed is to never give up. Remember, you're my assistant.
</line><line>Edgeworth:
...Of course, I don't plan on giving up either. It's just... My theory that he couldn't enter the prison no longer holds. It looks like we'll have to investigate once more.
