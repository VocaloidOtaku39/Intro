Maya:
Hey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!
</line><line>Phoenix:
*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?
</line><line>Maya:
Hey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Maya:
We're about to hit the <textEffects>big time</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
"Big time"? And what do you mean by "we"? You don't mean you and me are...?
</line><line>Maya:
Ha! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!
</line><line>Pearl:
Hello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Pearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?
</line><line>Pearl:
Hey hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's this...? Some kind of poster?)</textEffects> <textEffects>Kurain Village</textEffects>... Isn't that...?
</line><line>Maya:
That's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What's this about "<textEffects>treasures</textEffects>" from the boonies?
</line><line>Maya:
Ha ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Tonight? What about tonight?
</line><line>Pearl:
The "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!
</line><line>Maya:
That's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Heh. Same Maya. Different Day.)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...
</line><line>Maya:
I've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey! Who are you calling "shady"!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her "Pearls". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.
</line><line>Pearl:
I know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Kurain Village is the home of the mysterious <textEffects>Kurain Channelling Technique</textEffects>. And Maya here is the <textEffects>daughter</textEffects> of the Kurain School of Channeling's <textEffects>Master</textEffects>. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Maya:
Earth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?
</line><line>Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here. Might as well head on out...)</textEffects>

Wow... This is awesome!
</line><line>Phoenix: 
Yeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.
</line><line>Pearl: 
Oh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!
</line><line>Maya:  
Oh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!

Th-This place is scary... I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...
</line><line>Maya:
Don't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!

...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Maya:
Eeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!

Good evening. ...It's good to see you again.

Y-You... I know you...

Ha ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.
</line><line>Pearl: 
Ah! H-Hello!
</line><line>Maya: 
Is she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?
</line><line>Andrews: 
Nice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements
</line><line>Maya: 
Oh, um... N-Nice to meet you.
</line><line>Phoenix:

Um, well actually...
</line><line>Andrews: 
I've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?
</line><line>Maya: 
Ooh! I like the sound of that! "Dine"... It sounds so fancy!
</line><line>Pearl: 
I'll have the "Kid's Lunch"!
</line><line>Maya: 
Ha ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a "Kid's Dinner"?

OK! In that case, one "Kid's Dinner" for me!

Ha ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?

</line><line>Phoenix:  
...M-Masque the Mask...?
</line><line>Announcer:  
<textEffects>According to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:  
L-Lordly Tailor...!?
</line><line>Maya:  
Well, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!
</line><line>Phoenix:  
Treasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?
</line><line>Maya:  
Yes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The <textEffects>Kurain Sacred Urn</textEffects> was STOLEN!!

Right! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!
</line><line>Phoenix: 
...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.
</line><line>Maya: 
Yeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.
</line><line>Pearl: 
Hmmm... Bad guy, huh.
</line><line>???: 
Hey! You can't poke around here, pal!
</line><line>Phoenix: 
Wait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!
</line><line>???: 
It's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying "not again"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?
</line><line>Phoenix: 
I should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?
</line><line>???: 
No, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?
</line><line>Phoenix: 
Hey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--
</line><line>Maya: 
Alright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?

Oh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh... Actually, my name is Gumshoe. "Detective Dick Gumshoe"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!

And if it's too long for you, you can just call him "Dick".

Okay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!

Um... Yeah... Good to see you again, too, I guess.

Yikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?

"How" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.

I doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Pearl:
I... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!
</line><line>Pearl:
Well, I'm going out now for a little bit.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh!? Wh-Where are you going...?
</line><line>Pearl:
I may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!

Hey! W-Wait a...! <textEffects>(Ack! She sure runs fast...)</textEffects>

Nick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?

*sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you!

N-No, it's okay, don--
</line><line>Andrews:
I know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn.

Hello?

...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear.
</line><line>Atmey:
Welcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Err, umm... We're actually kind of...
</line><line>Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected.
</line><line>Maya:
Wh-What is?
</line><line>Atmey:
...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?
</line><line>Maya:
...Umm. I think we've already been through this.
</line><line>Atmey:
Ha! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?

<line>Phoenix:
There was a <textEffects>security camera</textEffects> set up at the scene of the crime. It should have <textEffects>automatically taken a photo</textEffects> of anyone that went through that door.
</line><line>Atmey:
...Precisely.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly <textEffects>once</textEffects> last night.
</line><line>Atmey:
Wha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned.
</line><line>Atmey:
Wh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly?
</line><line>Phoenix: 
Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! <textEffects>(If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some <span style="color:#E16935">reason</textEffects> that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the <textEffects>piece of evidence</textEffects> that should prove it!)</span> OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask☆DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were...
</line>



<line>Atmey:
...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. <textEffects>Time to put your money where your mouth is. Show me your evidence!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Detective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!?
</line><line>Atmey:
Ha ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This sword proves it!
</line><line>Atmey:
...! Th-That's...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Before the theft, this sword was <textEffects>in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey</textEffects>. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent.
</line><line>Atmey:
Aaah... Err...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? What about it!?
</line><line>Atmey:
...I'm impressed. You truly are an "Ace Attorney"...

No, that he <textEffects>never actually saw the thief</textEffects>.

Just one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!

But you never actually saw him!

Perhaps so, but I installed a <textEffects>security camera</textEffects> for just such a contingency.

Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a <textEffects>green envelope</textEffects> somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.
