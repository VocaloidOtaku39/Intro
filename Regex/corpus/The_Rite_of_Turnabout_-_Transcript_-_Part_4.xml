</line><line>Phoenix:
What kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot?
</line><line>Ema:
According to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple.
</line><line>Ema:
Furthermore...
</line>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<line>Ema:
<textEffects>He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a <textEffects>fake name</textEffects>! The royal priestess uses a deceased's <textEffects>face</textEffects> and <textEffects>true name</textEffects> to summon their spirit.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Why, yes, that is indeed true.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
If he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in.
</line><line>Phoenix:
An illegal immigrant? <textEffects>(Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Ema:
But if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination Séance this time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk!
</line><line>Judge:
I had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? <textEffects>Should we add this to the testimony?</textEffects>
</line>


</td></tr></tbody></table>

<line>Ema:
<textEffects>He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Ema:
<textEffects>He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>
</line>


<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Sorry, Detective Skye... But the police missed something important in their investigation.
</line><line>Ema:
Huh?! Wh-What are you talking about?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim was undeniably a Khura'inese native! And this crime scene photo proves it.
</line><line>Judge:
I-It does?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's a little hard to see, but look closely. You'll see clear proof that the victim was Khura'inese.
</line><line>Ema:
Wh-Where? I don't see anything that would prove that!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This proves the victim was Khura'inese!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Look at this tattoo right here!
</line><line>Judge:
Why that's... a <textEffects>tattoo of a peach</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would like you all to think about the meaning of this tattoo.
</line><line>Ema:
Oh, umm... The victim really liked peaches?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, peaches are a favored delicacy here in Khura'in.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
They happen to be a personal favorite of mine. The sweetness of their abundant nectars and the softness of their perfectly ripe flesh... They are a blessing from the Holy Mother herself.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick, I've suddenly got a craving for peaches!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...After the trial, Maya. Right now we have bigger fish to fry. Unfortunately, that is NOT a tattoo of a peach.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...It is not a peach, you say? Then what is it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a closer look. Haven't you seen something like that before? Namely, the tattoo on the high priest's brow.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my!
</line><line>Ema:
What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This mark is only borne by members of the <textEffects>Khura'inist clergy</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
So that is what you believe it to be. But are they not utterly different shapes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure, they're shaped differently, but there's a reason for that. The victim had the peach-shaped tattoo inked over an existing tattoo for some reason. However, the dark red portion is exactly the same as the mark all Khura'inist clergy bear.
</line><line>Ema:
Hey, you're right!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Until about twenty-some-odd years ago, everyone did get one, didn't they? I myself bear one on my right buttoc--
</line><line>Nahyuta:
That is entirely too much information, Your Magistry.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Information on everyone who enters the clergy is maintained at the temple! All we have to do is look up a monk with a mark in the same spot!
</line><line>Ema:
I'm on it! I'll let you know if I get any hits!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
That will not be necessary. If you seek information on the clergy... ...I have it all right here.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! You never cease to amaze! ...So, tell us, is there anyone who fits the bill?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
.............................. ...There is just one, and his name is <textEffects>Rheel Neh'mu</textEffects>. He became a monk twenty years ago.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then that must be the victim's real name.
</line><line>Judge:
But why would he have tried to cover up his tattoo with another one?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah... There must've been some reason...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! That's not important right now. The important thing is we know his real name.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're right! Your Magistry! Now that we know the victim's real name... ...the <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> might finally work!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... A lawyer who willingly seeks a Séance... This is entirely unprecedented.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh. You are but digging your own grave, defense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
We won't know that until we try. <textEffects>(Sure, it's risky, but it's our only hope!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. Let the Divination Séance be held once more! 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
.............................. Why would a lawyer work so hard to see the Divination Séance be held once more? You are a fool, Barbed Head. And your foolishness shall yield no gratitude from me. For with the truth revealed by my Insights, I shall gladly seek your demise!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Bring it on, Princess. Because I will correctly interpret each and every one of your Insights.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph! You will regret ever thinking you could use my sacred Insights as evidence. O Holy Mother! We hold this <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their <textEffects>final memories</textEffects> in the <textEffects>Pool of Souls</textEffects>!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...Oh, my! It is just as Mr. Wright surmised. Puhray Zeh'lot wasn't the victim's true name! And now at last, we have seen the victim's final moments!
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But... All we could see was the ground!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You seem terribly disappointed. I take it you did not find any fodder for one of your infamous turnabouts?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ngrk!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
I, on the other hand, have discovered something: Conclusive evidence that establishes the accused's guilt!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-You did?!
</line><line>Judge:
Ha ha ha ha ha! A most surprising surprise attack! ...So, tell us, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is this conclusive evidence you have found?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...The <textEffects>Plumed Punisher theme song</textEffects> that the deceased heard. Please consider this item here. It was confiscated from the accused during her interrogation.
</line><line>Maya:
Hey, that's my Plumed Punisher strap!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
When you press the magatama on the Plumed Punisher's belt...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
It seems the accused inadvertently pressed the button in the midst of her crime. This strap is an extremely rare item, is it not, Ms. Fey?
</line><line>Maya:
You'd better not break it! There's <textEffects>only one of those in the whole wide world</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
M-Maya, noooooooooo!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Heh heh heh heh! It is just as I said. Your flights of fancy... have come crashing down on you!
</line><line>Maya:
She sure seems to be enjoying this.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... I've never seen her look so thrilled before either.
</line><line>Rayfa:
It is time to accept the fact that the Divination Séance is far more than mere evidence! It is the very truth that brings the hammer of justice down upon the accused!
</line><line>Judge:
That is as conclusive as evidence can get. Now then, if there are no further objections...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Slow down there, Your Magistry. At least let me make a counterargument!
</line><line>Judge:
What's this? Do you take issue with the Divination Séance?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, I have issues with it. I just don't know what they are yet. But that's never stopped me before!)</textEffects> The Divination Séance is not the absolute truth! It only becomes the truth after it's been interpreted correctly.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Grr! You do not know when you are beaten, do you, you foolish lawyer. I am the only one who speaks for the mitamah of the deceased! If you believe there to be errors in my Insights, then let us see you prove it!
</line>
<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Insight</textEffects><textEffects> -- Rayfa's Insight --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Rayfa:
The victim was offering up his prayers...
It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.
Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...
The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.
The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
That is everything the deceased experienced in his final moments.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Her Benevolence's Insights have painted a detailed picture, both vivid and true.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I didn't notice any holes there. As they stand now, those Insights are really stacked against us. I'll just have to go over each and every one of the deceased's sensations very carefully.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
<textEffects>The victim was offering up his prayers...</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Was it really the night of the rite...?
</line><line>Rayfa:
What do you mean? It could not be otherwise! The accused slew Acolyte Zeh'lot after killing the high priest during the Purification Rite.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only problem is, the deceased's spirit does not corroborate that.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What's this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take a good look at what the victim smelled. Do you see how it says "<textEffects>gingihl</textEffects>"? Acolyte Zeh'lot shouldn't have smelled any gingihl on the night of the rite!
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me back up my statement with some evidence for you. <textEffects>This should explain how the victim couldn't have smelled gingihl on the night of the rite!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, told me about the <textEffects>Feast of Blessings</textEffects>. The feast includes a number of gingihl-based dishes. And they're only supposed to be served at a certain time the day before the rite!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I believe you're right! I had completely forgotten about that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
During the feast, the unique smell of gingihl pervades the entire kingdom. The fact that the victim smelled it means... ...he was murdered between noon and 3 PM the day before the Purification Rite!
</line><line>Rayfa:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/77/SoJ_That%27s_enough%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420132131" class="image"><img alt="SoJ That&#39;s enough!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="163" data-image-name="SoJ That&#39;s enough!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_That%27s_enough%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/77/SoJ_That%27s_enough%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420132131" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. I am not so easily fooled! Did that <textEffects>autopsy report</textEffects> not make it clear? The estimated time of death was during the rite!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, right. I taught her about that yesterday.)</textEffects> Forgive me, Your Benevolence... ...but the estimated time of death is just that -- an estimate. Depending on the circumstances, it's possible for it to change.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wh-What's this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Like, if a body was kept cold, the slowed rate of decay makes the death seem more recent.
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I believe I have heard something of the sort before. Hmm... If it is as Mr. Wright claims... ...the estimated time of death in the autopsy report will have to be revised.
</line><line><textEffects>Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Nnnggrrrrrrrrrrr! Barbed Head! You... You blinded me with science!
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-Sorry... <textEffects>(Wait, what am I apologizing for?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. ...No matter. The murder may have occurred in the afternoon hours the day before the rite. Nevertheless... The murder weapon with the accused's prints on it is incontrovertible evidence. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth.
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Insight Revised</captions>
<line><s>It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.</s>
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.
</line><line>Rayfa:
The time of death has been corrected, leaving my Insight infallible.
</line><line>Maya:
Nick! A change in the time of death is bound to cause some sort of an inconsistency!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I had something that showed what it was like on that day, it could really help.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
<textEffects>The victim was offering up his prayers...</textEffects>

</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The change in the date and time of the crime... ...has caused a new inconsistency to surface.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What's this?! Augh! You are making that irritating face again! Cease that at once!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sorry, but this is the face I was born with. Now, let's focus on what is important -- <textEffects>what the victim saw</textEffects> in his final moments.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Do you have bats in the belfry, Barbed Head? There is nothing to see. The ground at the plaza was all that entered the victim's eyes.
</line><line>Phoenix: 
And that's what I find so strange. On the day before the rite, it should've been impossible to see that pattern on the ground!
</line><line>Judge:
Impossible, you say?! ...Do explain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This piece of evidence shows why the plaza's ground was not visible that day!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This newspaper has an article that is tiny in size, but huge in importance. It says that the ground was covered with "<textEffects>thick, white ice</textEffects>" the day before the rite.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What?! B-But...!
</line><line>Judge:
The victim did not see so much as an ice cube on the ground!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly. And so we must ask: What WAS the victim looking at in his final moments?
</line><line>Rayfa:
If you have something to say, then say it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The last thing the victim saw was not the ground at the Plaza of Devotion. This can only mean that he was killed elsewhere!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Wha--!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Wha--!
</line><line>Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Then where do you propose the victim was actually killed?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Yes, tell us where! Otherwise, your argument is worthless!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, about that... <textEffects>(Argh, I hadn't gotten to that part yet!)</textEffects> Any ideas, Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Umm... Let me think... Well... it's somewhere green and shaggy, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right, but where could that be?
</line><line>Rayfa:
What is it, Barbed Head? Giving up already?
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-Not at all! <textEffects>(Now, where have I seen something green and shaggy...?)</textEffects> <textEffects>This shows where the victim was killed!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>secret hideout</textEffects> the rebels were using!
</line><line>Rayfa:
The rebel hideout? There was no such place anywhere on the floor of that chamber!
</line><line>Phoenix:
You're absolutely right. <textEffects>(There's no place... on the <span style="color:#E16935">floor</textEffects>, anyway.)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Then what did the victim see in his final moments if not the floor of the rebel hideout?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is what the victim saw in his final moments!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
The shaggy green surface the victim saw was one of the <textEffects>moss</textEffects>-covered stone slabs! As you can see, there are two distinct hand-shaped impressions in the moss here. I believe the victim was killed while he stood there with his hands pressed against the slab!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
That does agree with the Séance vision. However, one cannot definitely declare they are one and the same.
</line><line>Judge:
I concur. There is no proof that a murder occurred in the rebel hideout.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Indeed! What evidence do you have of this?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I've already shown you the evidence.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Please take a look at this second version of the photo I just showed you. You can see the results of the luminol test I performed in the rebel hideout. This is proof positive that someone had been bleeding in front of that stone slab.
</line><line>Judge:
Is this true?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This information has already been provided to the police.
</line><line>Judge:
Detective Skye, to whom does this blood belong?
</line><line>Ema:
W-We thought it was the high priest's blood that flowed in from outside... ...so we haven't tested it yet.
</line><line>Judge:
Then you must do so at once!
</line><line>Ema:
Y-Yes, Your Magistry!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
It appears the police have finished testing the blood. Detective Skye, your report, please.
</line><line>Ema:
The blood found in the rebel hideout... ...belongs to Puhray Zeh'lot, just like the defense claims!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Detective Skye, do you realize what your blunder has done to me? When this trial concludes, I want to see you in my prayer chamber. There, I will deliver a joyous sermon onto you for eight hours straight.
</line><line>Ema:
I-I'm really sorry, but... Please, anything but that!
</line><line>Maya:
...Nick, maybe, just maybe... ...this is the chance we've been waiting for!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yep, it would seem so. <textEffects>(I hate to do this to Ema, but...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Go for it! It's full speed ahead!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim was killed in the rebel hideout the day before the Purification Rite. Then, his body was moved to the Plaza of Devotion by someone we've yet to identify! So, when we thought we saw Acolyte Zeh'lot praying during the rite, he was already <textEffects>dead</textEffects>!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Aaaaaaugh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's not all. If he was killed at the Inner Sanctum, that would explain one more thing.
</line><line>Judge:
And that would be...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
How the time of death was made to look later than it actually was. The proof of which, was left behind at the sanctum. <textEffects>This points to how the time of death was made to appear later than it actually was!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Why, these are... photos of the Inner Sanctum?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'd like you to focus on this one. The proof is right here in this photo. This is how the time of death was made to appear later than it really was. Do you see how the snow has been removed from this one spot only? That's because it was used to keep the victim's body cold. And that's why the time of death wasn't what it seemed!
</line><line>Rayfa:

</line><line>Rayfa:
The time was mistaken? And the place, too? And just what do you believe that proves?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-That my client is innocent.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What of her fingerprints on the dagger, and the Plumed Punisher theme the victim heard? You have failed to address these two key pieces of evidence.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk! I-I see your point.
</line><line>Maya:
Wasn't this your big chance, Nick?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ahh... I'm really hoping that the difference in location can invalidate... ...either the weapon or the theme song from being used as evidence against you.
</line><line>Maya:
Actually, that might be possible. At least, for one of them.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Rayfa:
What's this? You say you can contradict our argument for a key piece of evidence?! Very well, let us see you try!
</line><line>Maya:
Nick, take a good look at the rebel hideout photo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Umm... Uhh... ...Oh! <textEffects>The defense can invalidate this piece of evidence!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Rayfa:
The Plumed Punisher theme? And how do you intend to support such a claim?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Since the murder happened in the rebel hideout... ...there's something there that played the theme song, other than my client's strap!
</line><line>Judge:
It wasn't the strap?! Is this true?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The item that played The Plumed Punisher theme song was this!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is a Plumed Punisher alarm clock. I believe the victim heard its alarm go off!

</line><line>Rayfa:

</line><line>Phoenix:
What proof do YOU have that it was my client's strap that played the theme song?!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Auuugh! Do not twist the facts with your lawyerly wiles! Either way, the accused would still be guilty based off of her prints on the murder weapon. And here is what really happened!
</line>
<captions aligned="center">Insight Revised</captions>
<line><s>The victim was offering up his prayers...</s>
The victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout.
</line><line><s>It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.</s>
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Though there have been some twists and turns, that is the truth of what happened.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Arngh! <textEffects>(I won't get anywhere until I can eliminate the dagger.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Most impressive, Your Benevolence. I see no inconsistencies anywhere in the prosecution's case.
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, there is one!
</line><line>Judge:
What's this?! You still claim there to be an inconsistency?!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Hmph. Try as you might, the outcome will always be the same.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
<textEffects>The victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout.</textEffects>
</line>

<line><textEffects>It was the afternoon of the day before the rite.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The victim was originally thought to have been stabbed while bent over in prayer. But he was actually standing with his hands against the stone slab. So the question is, where did the sensation of something heavy come from?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Yes, I see your point.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Since the victim was standing, he couldn't have been held down.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Eeeep!
</line><line>Judge:
Then tell us, Mr. Wright, what was that heavy sensation felt by the victim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Hmm... <textEffects>What caused the heavy sensation</textEffects> Zeh'lot felt? Any thoughts, Maya?
</line><line>Maya:
Uhh... I agree, that sense of heaviness seems important, but... There's also the matter of Zeh'lot's hands on the stone slab. Why were they even there?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Could it be related to the cause of the heavy sensation?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have an answer for us?
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Of course! <textEffects>(If I just envision the state Zeh'lot was in when he was killed...)</textEffects> <textEffects>The cause of the heaviness the victim felt was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The only conceivable cause is... ...the stone slab falling over, trapping the victim underneath!
</line><line>Judge:
What?!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh...! The stone slab came falling down on him, crushing him underneath.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. That was the cause of the heavy sensation the victim felt.
</line><line>Nahyuta:

</line><line>Nahyuta:
While your theory is impressive, you have overlooked a key fact. The victim was not crushed to death. Rather, he was <textEffects>stabbed</textEffects>.
</line><line>Phoenix:
O-Oh yeah...
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Or do you claim that the dagger was plunged in after the slab had fallen on him? Plus, had the killer been behind the victim, they would have both been crushed together.
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Would you care to explain?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Sure, I'd love to. That doesn't mean I can! Hmm... How could the dagger have been plunged in after the slab fell on the victim?)</textEffects> The killer couldn't have plunged the dagger into the victim after the slab fell on him. But, what if the murder weapon wasn't what we thought it was?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Well, there WERE other weapons in the rebel hideout. But the entrance to the hideout is right by the stone slab. There isn't enough space between the two to use any of the weapons found within.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah... There's not much space by the entrance, is there... <textEffects>(So, what was the real murder weapon, then? I better think of something!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
If the murder weapon wasn't the dagger... ...then the dagger must've been plunged into the victim after he was already dead. That means he was stabbed at least twice, but the autopsy doesn't mention that.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Then he must've been stabbed in the same spot with <textEffects>something shaped like the dagger</textEffects>.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Would the defense care to offer an explanation sometime this century?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wait, wasn't there something dagger-like near the scene of the crime? ...Something that had a shape similar to the Warbaa'd Dagger?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Present your evidence at this time, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This shows what really killed the victim!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Is this not the photo from the scene of the high priest's murder? Are you suggesting the murder weapon is hidden herein?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is what really took Puhray Zeh'lot's life!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
B-But that is the...!
</line><line>Rayfa:
The warbaa'd statue?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly! The warbaa'd statue has dagger-like feathers protruding from it. That is what really took the victim's life!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You imbecilic fool! The statue is outside of the hideout! How do you propose it impaled someone who was inside?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Haven't you heard? The warbaa'd statue also functions as the hideout's door.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...What do you mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The statue can pull a complete <textEffects>switcheroo</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
A switch... eroo...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
To put it simply... it's a <textEffects>revolving door</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
A <textEffects>revolving door</textEffects>?! Why, that makes perfect sense!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, I believe the truth behind the Divination Séance to be this! As the victim entered the secret hideout, the stone sculpture came toppling toward him. He threw up his hands to stop it, but its weight forced him backwards. Unfortunately, the warbaa'd statue was right behind him.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Th-This... This cannot be...!
</line><line>Rayfa:

</line><line>Rayfa:
B-But the accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She had held it while rehearsing for the rite. Which is when her prints got on it!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Gah!
</line><line>Judge:
This is a shocking turn of events, but... ...there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence in the defense's favor. I believe we must accept that the warbaa'd statue was what killed the victim.
</line><line><textEffects>Warbaa'd Statue added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now that we know how Acolyte Zeh'lot really met his demise... ...there's no basis for claiming my client committed this crime!
</line><line>Maya:
Nice work, Nick!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...How can this be happening yet again? The Divination Séance...  is the only truth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, Your Benevolence. It's not the truth itself, but it IS a means for shedding light on the truth!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Nnngh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Do you understand now? Your kingdom needs lawyers so that they can interpret your Insights.
</line><line>Rayfa:
B-But... That means I... ...I have been misinterpreting the voices of the spirits all this time?
</line><line>Judge:
Y-Your Benevolence! Are you unwell? All the color has drained from your face.
</line><line>Rayfa:
........................ I will be fine. Continue your proceedings without me.
</line><line>Judge:
...As you wish.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I feel kind of bad for her.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Now then, I would have the defense continue. Please explain what you have learned now that we know how the victim actually died.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in the hideout before the high priest's murder. That means the body found at the Plaza of Devotion was moved there by the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>... ...but only after the Warbaa'd Dagger was thrust into him... ...to make it look like the murder weapon.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That does seem to agree with what we now know. But why would the real killer go to such lengths?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It was an attempt to make my client look like a serial killer. That's right! The real killer planned all of this. This forged serial murder case!
</line><line>Judge:
They did?!
</line><line>Maya:
That's it, Nick! Keep hammering away!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Your reasoning has more holes in it than that cheese you foreigners so enjoy.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What...?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Like those putrid, hole-riddled clumps of curds that only a rat like you could love... ...your reasoning, much like your putrid, hole-riddled brain, has putrefied.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(What's his deal with things going putrid...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You have yet to overturn my argument that the accused is the killer. A careful analysis of the chain of events up to the killing exposes the truth as follows: Disguised as Lady Kee'ra, the accused found the rebel hideout the day before the rite. But Acolyte Zeh'lot had followed her there after noticing her suspicious behavior. Caught by surprise, she pushed the stone slab toward him... and we know the rest.
</line><line>Maya:
I-I've never been to the rebel hideout in my life!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
When the high priest arrived at the sanctum the next day, he realized what she had done. That is when the accused murdered him in order to silence him.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I believe Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has posed a compelling scenario. The defense, on the other hand, has yet to disprove the accused's guilt.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Why would my client move Acolyte Zeh'lot's body to where everyone could see it? And why would she stab the dagger with her fingerprints into his dead body? She had no reason to do any of those things!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The dagger in his corpse was likely a warning to the rebels. Something along the lines of "Lady Kee'ra will slay the Defiant Dragons."
</line><line>Judge:
So that is why she moved the body to the plaza for all to see...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now he has the judge convinced, too?! I thought I'd finally made some headway!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? About time for one of your groans of distress, is it not?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>("G-Groan of distress"...? It kills me to admit this, but I've got nothing to counter his argument with. And I still haven't disproven the allegations 
against Maya.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Is it not time to end your futile struggle? You were already judged guilty yesterday. That makes you a dead lawyer walking. Accept the death that now awaits you, and in doing so, finally know peace.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
A dead lawyer walking, indeed... Then again, are not all lawyers who practice in Khura'in? But I must admit, I misspoke earlier. Allow me to amend my statement. I had said the defense's reasoning had a putrid, cheese-like smell... ...but I now realize the stench was from his own putrid body, on the verge of death.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now I'm a rotting zombie... Think... Who could've killed Zeh'lot the day before the rite? Who knew about the rebel hideout, and could gain access to the Inner Sanctum?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Maya:
Hmm... Only those involved with the rite can enter the sanctum, so... 
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Wait a second! <textEffects>(Only a <span style="color:#E16935">rebel</textEffects> would've known about the secret hideout. And the only person who was <textEffects>involved with the rite</textEffects>, had access to the sanctum... ...and was suspected of being a <textEffects>rebel</textEffects> is...)</span> Ahhhhhhhhh!
</line><line>Maya:
Did somebody come to mind?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes... Except there's one huge problem.
</line><line>Maya:
A huge problem?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
What are you two going on about? Plotting your escape from this sacred hall? I would not put it past you, considering you have no means to raise further objection.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(If I don't do something, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi will have this one in the bag. I'll just have to bluff my way out of this, regardless of that huge problem.)</textEffects> Your Magistry, I believe there is another suspect in Puhray Zeh'lot's murder!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Even the most benevolent Holy Mother would not forgive such a desperate lie. After all, you know very well that such a person does not exist.
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-No, there is one person who knew everything!
</line><line>Judge:
D-Does such a figure truly exist?! Tell us, who might that be?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>I believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
It had to be someone allowed to enter the sanctum, and who knew of the hideout. And that would be... the <textEffects>high priest</textEffects>. He could've committed the crime if it occurred the day before the rite!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You would pin a crime upon the dead, knowing very well they tell no tales? Have you no shame!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Dead men tell no tales... That is definitely a problem. If only the high priest could tell his side of the story.)</textEffects>

...Umm. Hmm... ...Wh-What? Do I have something on my face?

Oh, no! Don't tell me I have some of my breakfast caught between my teeth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No, if there's even the slightest possibility, I'll have to go with it!)</textEffects> Your Magistry! Dead men DO tell tales! Therefore, I would like to request the high priest's <textEffects>testimony</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
His... testimony?! And just how do you propose we get the deceased to testify?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>There's a way for the dead to testify!  It's known as...!</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Summon him here by means of <textEffects>spirit channeling</textEffects>!

<captions aligned="center">Spirit channeling? Has this lawyer finally gone insane?!This is sacrilege! May the Holy Mother strike him down!</captions>

Don't worry. It's not like it's against the law or violates some religious precepts, so... ...I don't think we'll be punished. At least, I hope not.
</line><line>Phoenix:
But this is a crucial period for you. It'll decide whether you become master of Kurain.
</line><line>Maya:
We don't have any other choice, now do we? If I'm found guilty, it'll be a lot worse than not becoming master of Kurain.

</line><line>Judge:
Very well, then! Umm... Your Benevolence? What if the accused accidentally calls forth an evil spirit?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Do you truly believe this foreigner is capable of channeling spirits?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, umm...  no, but I wanted to be sure, as I am responsible for the safety of all present.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Well, an inexperienced practitioner could inadvertently call forth a dangerous spirit. But do not fear, for I have a <textEffects>Magatama of Parting</textEffects>. With it, I can send spirits back to the Twilight Realm by halting the flow of spiritual power.
</line><line>Judge:
...Th-That is a relief, indeed.
</line><line>Rayfa:
These foreigners have thrown down the gauntlet. Let us not shirk from their challenge! We must prove them guilty and deliver their last rites! Do I make myself clear, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Perfectly, Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, the accused may channel the high priest's spirit. But first, we must take a short recess to prepare. We will resume as soon as the preparations are complete. Until then, this court is adjourned!

Will the defense please explain the situation to the high priest?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'd be happy to. Your disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot, has been murdered. It happened on the day before the Purification Rite. And the crime occurred in the rebel hideout hidden within the Inner Sanctum.
</line><line>Tahrust:
A-Acolyte Zeh'lot? He has been killed? ...Who would do such a thing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Someone who knew of the hideout, and had access to the Inner Sanctum... In other words, YOU, Abbot Inmee. After all, weren't you secretly a rebel?

...Oh, right!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Abbot Inmee, the prosecution believes the one who slew both you and Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...to be Maya Fey, who had been playing the role of Lady Kee'ra in the rite.

</line><line>Phoenix:
The high priest says his memory is hazy!
</line><line>Tahrust:
...HRRMMMMMM! It is all coming back to me. It is as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi concluded. I was slain by none other than Maya Fey.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
The high priest's statement has proven my assertions with regards to his murder correct.
</line><line>Phoenix:
NOOOOOOOOO! B-But what about Acolyte Zeh'lot?! You were the one who killed him, weren't you?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Hrrmm...? I know naught about my disciple's murder. Furthermore, I have an alibi of my own.
</line><line>Phoenix:
An alibi?! Seriously?!
</line><line>Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! It seems the testimony the defense had been hoping for is working against him. Now Abbot Inmee, your testimony, if you please.

Yes, yes of course.

<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects><textEffects>-- I Have an Alibi --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Tahrust:
I have an ironclad alibi for the time during which the murder took place.
Just past noon on the day before the rite, I was entertaining guests at my home.
And I believe my guests can corroborate this.

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
You had guests? <textEffects>(Just past noon... That's right about <span style="color:#E16935">the time Zeh'lot was murdered</textEffects>!)</span> Are you sure about that?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Absolutely.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Come to think of it, Rayfa told me about a spirit's memory...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled?

Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life.

Abbot Inmee was at home during the crime, but knew of what happened at the hideout. I believe this can be explained thusly... He must have had a way to monitor the hideout from his home.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?!
</line><line>Tahrust:
..................  Y-You never cease to amaze, Prosecutor. As he has surmised, there was a listening device installed at the hideout. It enabled me to instantly learn of anything unusual, even when I was not there.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Remember, the rebels had been using this as a top-secret hideout. It would be perfectly natural for them to install such an apparatus.

<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That was a listening device...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
It starts recording whenever it detects movement. And I heard just such a recording after His Magistry and his family left. If you look in the desk in my study, you will find the tape in question.

The fact is, of course, a stone slab did fall over onto Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...impaling him on the warbaa'd statue behind him. But that was only revealed through Her Benevolence's Divination Séance earlier.

Need I remind you Abbot Inmee was with His Magistry at the time of the crime. Such an alibi precludes him from being the killer!

</line><line>Phoenix:
As we all know, the high priest was secretly a rebel! It would follow that his favorite disciple could very well be a rebel, too!
</line><line>Judge:
A-Are you suggesting that Mrs. Inmee killed her husband, as well?
</line><line>Phoenix:
As sad as it is to think she'd kill her own husband to rid the kingdom of rebels... ...I don't think we can rule it out.

You claim my wife is that rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And that she slew both Zeh'lot and myself? My lovely wife?! That is utterly impossible! KAAAAAAAAAH!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk!
</line><line>Judge:
Yikes! I have never seen the high priest so angry!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
It is as Abbot Inmee stated. And the accused has already been found guilty of his murder. It is far too late to overturn it.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's right, Mr. Wright! N-Now apologize to the good priest before he gets angry again! Quickly now!
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, I'm not going to apologize! The true identity of <textEffects>Lady Kee'ra</textEffects> is a major piece to this trial's puzzle! Admit it, Abbot Inmee -- your wife, Lady Inmee, killed you. Yet even now, you continue to lie in an effort to protect her.

</line><line>Tahrust:
How absurd! It appears the lawyer has forgotten. My lovely wife could not possibly battle the rebels in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. For we were <textEffects>blessed</textEffects> by Her Holiness and <textEffects>she is with child</textEffects>! Praise be to the Holy Mother!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ack, I completely forgot about that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
That abominable Lady Kee'ra figure who slew me and Acolyte Zeh'lot was the accused!

You foolish oaf of a lawyer. If only you were as <textEffects>blessed</textEffects> as Lady Inmee.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Surely, the accused possesses the strength -- or should I say, the power. ...The <textEffects>power</textEffects> to battle those black-hearted rebels.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about?
</line><line>Tahrust:
...My good prosecutor, I see you have come to the same conclusion as I. Such keen insight!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Then you have figured it out as well, Abbot Inmee? May I ask you to explain it to this putrid-brained lawyer?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Certainly. For I cannot allow him to frame my lovely wife for murder! Foreign devil! Your Magistry, allow me to testify as to how Maya Fey is that murderous Lady Kee'ra!
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, if it would assuage your anger... ...then by all means, please testify!

<hr />
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects><textEffects>-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --</textEffects></captions>
<line>Tahrust:
Acolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit.
She is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.
So, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us.
She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
B-But...
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Do you understand now? Murder by spirit channeling explains everything. This is the only way the accused could have defeated one rebel after another!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Indeed, I am a living... or shall I say "dead" proof of her terrible power.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaagh! <textEffects>(Maya's ability to channel spirits... It's come back to haunt her!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Now, is it not time to let it go, and move on, defense?

<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The Tome of Secrets is only given to the priestess who performs the Purification Rite. Is this your proof that my client could have channeled Lady Kee'ra?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Yes, indeed! For it contains the true name of Lady Kee'ra, a secret only revealed within!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Abbot Inmee... I'm afraid you're mistaken. This couldn't have been used to channel Lady Kee'ra.
</line><line>Tahrust:
What nonsense?!
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright, would you care to explain?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is why my client couldn't have channeled Lady Kee'ra!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Lady Kee'ra's face is hidden behind a mask in the Tome of Secrets! You need both a name and a face to channel a spirit!
</line><line>Tahrust:
...It can't be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Without a face... ...it would've been impossible for my client to channel Lady Kee'ra!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, the claim that she became Lady Kee'ra by means of spirit channeling... ...is patently false!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Gah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
And with Lady Kee'ra out of the equation, my client had no motive to commit murder!
</line><line>Judge:
B-But then... ...who is the <textEffects>rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra</textEffects> we've been reading about in the paper?!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Yes, who is this other suspect, if indeed there is one at all? Let us hear the defense's brilliant deduction!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Think, THINK! The true identity of Lady Kee'ra is the key to solving both murders! I thought Mrs. Inmee was suspicious, but her pregnancy takes her out of the running. And Mr. Are'bal is a rebel, so that doesn't make sense. That leaves us with... Hmm...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, you have that look again. The one where you know you have to say something, but you can't figure out what it is.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This is my chance to really turn up the heat. I'll just have to stir the pot till something floats to the top!)</textEffects> Your Magistry, I know who's been posing as the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra!
</line><line>Judge: 
Y-You do?! ...Are you sure about that?

Y-Yes! Completely!

Hmm... I sense that I may regret this, but please go on and explain.

Thank you, Your Magistry. <textEffects>(This is who's been posing as the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra!)</textEffects>

Wh-What's this?! The high priest's murdered disciple was Lady Kee'ra, you say? Peace! I say peace! The defense will continue.

Yes, Your Magistry. I whittled down the list of suspects until there was only one left.

</line><line>Nahyuta:
But a process of elimination is not the same as solid evidence. I assume you have evidence to back up your claim?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course! <textEffects>(I will have some in a moment, that is. At least, I hope so... Maya wasn't Lady Kee'ra, and neither was Mrs. Inmee or any of the other possibilities.

</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is what proves that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Lady Kee'ra: <textEffects>Lady Kee'ra's warning letter</textEffects>!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
How absurd! What could that possibly prove?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. You stated that this warning letter proved that my client was Lady Kee'ra. And the reason you gave was that the high priest's house was locked tight. But there was another member of the family who lived there.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Ah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Therefore, Acolyte Zeh'lot could have delivered the warning anytime he wanted!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Are you saying Lady Kee'ra was not the <textEffects>culprit</textEffects>, but rather the <textEffects>victim</textEffects>?!

That's exactly what I'm saying.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But...! That would... That would overturn the entire premise of this case! This trial has proceeded on the assumption Lady Kee'ra was behind the serial killings. But if Lady Kee'ra is one of the victims... ...who was the killer, and what was their motive?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The only suspect left is Mrs. Inmee. And there's only one possible motive!)</textEffects> What if Mrs. Inmee is a rebel?
</line><line>Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!

</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, you have no evidence, either. After all, the dagger with my client's prints on it wasn't what killed Acolyte Zeh'lot. And the Plumed Punisher theme that he heard could have been an alarm clock. That means all of the evidence linking her to the crime have been called into question!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Hrrrrrngh!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Was Lady Inmee a rebel, and did she pose as Lady Kee'ra to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot? Or was Acolyte Zeh'lot a rebel, and was the accused the Lady Kee'ra who killed him? I would say either scenario is just as likely. ...What are we to do now?

Heh heh heh heh heh. So that's it... Heh heh... Heh heh heh heh heh.

A-Abbot Inmee! Just what is so comical?!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Forgive my outburst... That has simply tickled my funny bone.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What did?
</line><line>Tahrust:
The theme song came from the Plumed Punisher clock, you say? ...Hmph! That alarm could not possibly have gone off.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What makes you say that? The clock was working just fine the last time I checked!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Try using your head for a change. Would not the existence of a secret hideout be given away if an alarm kept going off?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, you don't mean...
</line><line>Tahrust:
Indeed! We leave the alarm switched <textEffects>off</textEffects> at all times!
</line><line>Phoenix:
N-Nooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Judge:
I-In that case...
</line><line>Tahrust:
I am sad to say that the defense's claim does not hold water!
</line><line>Judge:
Would you care to respond, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, umm... <textEffects>(This can't be happening. Not now...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
This should put an end to the lawyer's futile struggles. The theme song the victim heard was from the accused's strap, just as we suspected. Therefore, the accused is the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra, and the victim's killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I need an opening. Something I can raise an objection to.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
That Plumed Punisher theme song Acolyte Zeh'lot heard in his final moments... I, too, heard it by way of the listening device.
</line><line>Phoenix:
B-But did you really? If you had heard it, why didn't you testify to the fact before?!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Is it not obvious?! I did not know such a tune could become a key matter of dispute. 
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, the matter of the theme song came up before Abbot Inmee was channeled.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, right. Well then, umm... What if he's lying about the clock's alarm being switched off?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Miserable wretch! That would be a pointless lie -- one easily disproven!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
If you check the clock, you will see that the alarm is, in fact, switched off.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Argh... Come to think of it...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Rayfa:
Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch...If I'm right... 
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(We set the switch back into the off position before we left.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
I remember hearing it clearly. Those <textEffects>distinctive taiko drums</textEffects> in the intro are etched in my mind. They went... Daka don-don-don, don-don-don-don!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...<textEffects>Distinctive taiko drums in the intro</textEffects>?
</line><line>Judge:
...This trial has gone on far too long. Shall we move ahead to the verdict phase now?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
By all means. And let us also return Abbot Inmee's spirit to the Twilight Realm.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Before I go, let me say a word to my darling wife...

</line><line>Phoenix:
N-Now hold on just one minute! ...Your Magistry!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The high priest's statement is inconsistent with a certain piece of evidence!
</line><line>Judge:
It is?!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Still you writhe in defiance of your fate? The very sight reminds me of a tortured soul,  writhing in flames! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
You won't be saying that once I show you the evidence. <textEffects>(Now, all I have to do is pick the right one! This piece of evidence is inconsistent with that statement about the taiko drum intro!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
This is what's inconsistent with his statement. ...My client's Plumed Punisher strap.
</line><line>Tahrust:
What does that have to do with anything?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It plays the Plumed Punisher theme song. And here it is! The theme to "<textEffects>The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm</textEffects>"! Do you see what I mean? The music the victim heard in his final moments... ...might not have been the Plumed Punisher theme song!
</line><line>Judge:
Hm? I'm afraid I am not following you. What was it if not the Plumed Punisher theme?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>In his final moments, Acolyte Zeh'lot heard...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
There are no taiko drums in the intro of the Plumed Punisher theme! So what Acolyte Zeh'lot actually heard in his final moments was...  ...the theme of "<textEffects>The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo</textEffects>"!
</line><line>Judge:
Peace, peace! Peace, I say! ...Mr. Wright. What is this <textEffects>Steel Samurai</textEffects> of which you speak?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo is an action-hero show from America! The Plumed Punisher theme is a total rip-- Err... I mean,  is very similar to it. If you didn't know about The Steel Samurai, you could easily mistake the two.
</line><line>Tahrust:
But the fact that Acolyte Zeh'lot heard music from an American action-hero show... ...is irrefutable evidence that the accused was in the secret hideout!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Actually, no. You have it backwards.
</line><line>Tahrust:
B-Backwards...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Ms. Fey met an avid Plumed Punisher fan here in Khura'in. And as a token of their friendship... ...she <textEffects>traded</textEffects> a certain Steel Samurai item she had for the Plumed Punisher strap.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Hrrrmmmm?
</line><line>Judge:
And this avid Plumed Punisher fan... ...was the one who killed Acolyte Zeh'lot?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. And that avid fan is none other than the high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Do you have evidence to back up this claim, Mr. Wright? For as forgiving as the Holy Mother is... ...I doubt she would tolerate yet another dose of your baseless slander. I suggest you prepare yourself to face Her Holiness's wrath.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I'm prepared. ...To turn this entire case upside-down, that is! <textEffects>(This is my last chance! I better take a deep breath and review the evidence.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, then. Please present your evidence, if you would, defense.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The evidence that proves Mrs. Inmee was the one who killed Acolyte Zeh'lot is this!</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
It's right here in this family photo! Proof that Mrs. Inmee and Ms. Fey traded items featuring their favorite characters!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
A family photo?! And what exactly should we be looking at here?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>The proof that they exchanged items featuring their favorite characters is right here!</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Look at Mrs. Inmee's left wrist. You can see The Steel Samurai's trademark <textEffects>topknot</textEffects> right there!
</line><line>Tahrust:
...............
</line><line>Phoenix:
Which clearly makes this a <textEffects>Steel Samurai</textEffects> watch!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Hargh!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I never knew your wife had such hobbies, Abbot Inmee!
</line><line>Phoenix:
This family photo was taken right before Acolyte Zeh'lot was murdered. By that point, my client had the Punisher strap, and Mrs. Inmee had the Samurai watch. So, what the victim heard in his final moments... ...was none other than the sound of the watch Mrs. Inmee was wearing!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
Be not deceived by the defense's lawyerly chicanery.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Now what?! He's been pretty quiet up to this point. What does he have up his sleeve?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
There is a big, gaping hole in his flimsy claim.
</line><line>Phoenix:
A big, gaping hole? I don't think so!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Oh, no, I'm afraid it is there, all right. ...Just like the big, gaping holes in your putrid brain.
</line><line>Phoenix:
My brain is neither putrid nor full of holes. I'm not a zombie, after all.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Heh, says the dead lawyer walking... He who is narrow of vision focuses on what is before him, never seeing the big picture. Or as they say in your country, you cannot see the forest for the trees! For if it is as you said... ...and Lady Inmee, the rebel, slew Acolyte Zeh'lot, the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra... ...then <textEffects>the rebel hunter would have been dead before the high priest was slain</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
That means...! The high priest could not have been slain by the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Ack! How could I have missed that?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Who are you going to say killed the high priest now?!
</line><line>Phoenix: 
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Do you finally understand? The sheer size of the holes that riddle your putrid brain?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ack! <textEffects>(I'm in hot water now. I don't have any other suspects in the high priest's murder!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You mindless zombie. You should have begun your journey into the Twilight Realm long ago.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(No. I will never give up! I just need to think things through and figure out... ...who really killed the high priest!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
If Acolyte Zeh'lot had been Lady Kee'ra, he couldn't have killed the high priest! So, the question is, who did? Maybe I can get to the bottom of this by reviewing the events of this case in order! <textEffects>What evidence could tell me something about the crime scene before the murder?</textEffects> 
</line>


<captions aligned="center"><b>The spring was stained red before the rite</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Oh, right... Maya said that the spring had been stained red before the rite even began. <textEffects>The spring was already red before the high priest's murder because of...</textEffects>
</line>


<captions aligned="center"><b>The spring was stained red by Zeh'lot's blood</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
That's right... Zeh'lot had been killed in the rebel hideout the day before the rite. ...And his blood had flowed into the spring. Wait a second. The high priest knew that Zeh'lot had been killed in the hideout. So why didn't he report it to the authorities? If Maya had been the killer, he could have easily had her arrested on the spot. <textEffects>Why didn't the high priest inform the authorities right then?</textEffects>
</line>


<captions aligned="center"><b>He wanted to keep the hideout secret</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
If he reported Zeh'lot's murder...  ...the authorities would find out about the hideout. That's what he was worried about! But by going through with the rite... ...the high priest risked having Maya see the spring running red with blood. <textEffects>Why did he have to go through with the rite? Did he want to...?</textEffects>
</line>


<captions aligned="center"><b>Use the rite to cover things up</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
He wanted to set up the crime scene to conceal the hideout! <textEffects>But how was he planning on concealing the source of the blood in the spring?</textEffects>
</line>



<captions aligned="center"><b>Stain the spring with his own blood</b></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
He concealed the source of the blood with his own. That was how he kept the rebel hideout a secret! ...It's all starting to fall into place. <textEffects>I know who killed the high priest! It was...!</textEffects>

</line><line>Nahyuta:
The lawyer has placed a stain on the good priest's death with his putrid brain. Its putrid, gaping holes are as large as the hole in his logic.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What hole?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You still fail to understand. You truly cannot see the forest for the trees! You claim the high priest took his own life. But have you considered who brought the dagger to the Plaza of Devotion?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah...
</line><line>Nahyuta:
After the high priest was killed, the dagger was thrust into Acolyte Zeh'lot's dead body. Only the accused, Maya Fey, could have done that!
</line><line>Judge:
It is as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi says. Your claim is rather porous in its logic. And your evidence is too weak. You cannot prove that the high priest took his own life to conceal the rebel hideout.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Urk! <textEffects>(They're right -- the dagger was impaled in Zeh'lot's body... ...but his body had been placed at the plaza the previous day.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Would you care to respond?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Zeh'lot's body was already in the plaza the day before the rite. But what if the dagger was also already in him at that time?)</textEffects> <textEffects>The dagger was never at the Inner Sanctum.</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
Of course! That's it! 
</line><line>Nahyuta:
What is "it"?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There was no need to move the dagger. It had already been stabbed into Acolyte Zeh'lot's body the day before the rite.
</line><line>Judge:
What?! So that means... What does that mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It means the dagger wasn't the weapon that took the high priest's life!

</line><line>Nahyuta:
But no weapon was ever found at the Inner Sanctum. If you will not listen to reason, then I insist you prove your assertion. Show us what you believe the <textEffects>real murder weapon</textEffects> to be!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Th-The real weapon?! <textEffects>(I've got nothing, but I know there had to have been a weapon there! Maybe if I think back on the trial thus far, I'll spot the clue I need.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Well? Would the defense care to tell us what the real murder weapon is?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>This is what really killed the high priest!</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>What really killed him</textEffects> has been at the Inner Sanctum all this time. And its lethality has already been demonstrated by the late Acolyte Zeh'lot. That's right! It was the <textEffects>warbaa'd statue</textEffects>!

Poh-Poh-Poh-Poh-Poh... POHLKUNKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

..................... It's that time again.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And what time would that be?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Two thirty in the afternoon... The time my husband conducts his daily prayers. And... the time Puhray was slain.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That sound! It's...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai alarm!
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
.........I, too, like to pray at the same time as my dear husband. So, I set an alarm to remind me each day. But I had no idea it would come to this.
</line><line>Judge:
........................
</line><line>Tahrust:
No, stop! She knows not what she speaks!
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Your Magistry... I am the one who slew Acolyte Zeh'lot.
</line><line>Tahrust:
HRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</line><line>Judge:
A-Abbot Inmee! Bailiff, summon a physician at once!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
The physician is now attending the high priest, so there is no need to fear. Now, let us continue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Um... And what about the half of him called "Maya" that's still among the living?)</textEffects> Mrs. Inmee, will you tell us everything you know?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
The truth is... I am a rebel, just like my husband. This tragedy unfolded before the rite, during the Feast of Blessings. I had gone to the rebel hideout to prepare it for Datz's escape.
</line><line>Phoenix:
And that's when Acolyte Zeh'lot suddenly appeared?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
...Yes. Puhray was shocked when he saw me there.
</line><line>Judge:
Acolyte Zeh'lot did not know you were a rebel?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
...I do not believe he did. I believe he was there simply to investigate the hideout.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And then he suddenly came face-to-face with Mrs. Inmee...)</textEffects> So, the true identity of the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was Puhray Zeh'lot?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Yes... He was a member of the <textEffects>secret police</textEffects>, serving directly under the minister of justice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The <span style="color:#E16935">secret police</textEffects>?!)</span>
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
And this is what he said to me... "I can kill rebels with impunity. The justice minister has my back!" He was using his position within the secret police to deal us rebels a heavy blow. But murder sanctioned by the crown is still murder.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Inga:
Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!
</line><line>Inga:
Let's just say... <textEffects>I got a little trick up my sleeve</textEffects>. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The trick up Minister Inga's sleeve was Lady Kee'ra...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
N-No... This can't be! My father would never...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(This must be a bolt out of the blue for Rayfa.)</textEffects> This explains why Acolyte Zeh'lot abandoned his real name.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Yes... He even went as far as covering up the tattoo that all Khura'inist clergy members receive.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Lady Kee'ra was a member of the secret police? That explains why no order was given to investigate her attacks.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess I'm not alone in hearing this for the first time.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
But... But... This cannot be...
</line><line>Gallery:
</line>
<captions aligned="center">...Is this true? The justice minister is sanctioning state-sponsored murder?</captions>
<line>
Judge:
Peace! ...Now, Lady Inmee, please continue.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Puhray suddenly lunged at me. That's when I pushed the stone slab toward him with all my might. But I never meant for what happened next to occur...

</line><line>Tahrust:
Allow me to take it from here.
</line><line>Judge:
Abbot Inmee! Are you sure you're all right now?
</line><line>Tahrust:
I am sorry you had to see that. But you need not worry about me. I am already dead.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Please. We need to know what was so important that you would take your own life.
</line><line>Tahrust:
After I learned that my wife had accidentally slain Zeh'lot... ...I chilled his body with snow to make it seem as if he died more recently than he did. Then, I later moved it to the Plaza of Devotion and inserted the dagger into his wound. The plaza was empty at that time, for it was before prayer time had started. Finally, I placed his body in the prayer pose... ...knowing that no one would notice anything was wrong until the rite had concluded.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... It is perfectly plausible that no one would disturb him if he seemed to be praying. We do treasure our prayer time, after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, you admit you tried to pin this crime on Maya Fey?
</line><line>Tahrust:
...Yes, this was all my doing. I never told my wife of my plan. For surely she would have tried to stop me.
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
.................................
</line><line>Phoenix:
How did you get Ms. Fey's fingerprints on the dagger?
</line><line>Tahrust:
I had her hold it while we were rehearsing the rite the day before. And right before the rite, I drugged her with a sleeping agent. Then, I put Lady Kee'ra's robes over the warbaa'd statue.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That means... ...Maya was probably already groggy by the time the rite started.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
Finally, I ended my own life... ...to ensure that the crime would appear to have been by Acolyte Fey's own hand.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But when your body was discovered... ...Lady Kee'ra's robes were on the ground. How did they end up there if they were on the statue?
</line><line>Tahrust:
After I impaled myself on one of the statue's dagger-like feathers... ...I used the last ounce of my strength to hurl my body backwards. As I did, I grabbed onto the robes, taking them with me, as I fell back onto the ground.
</line><line>Judge:
How terrible! What possessed you to do such a thing?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
You needn't have committed suicide simply to frame the accused.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... As one well-versed in our kingdom's legal system... ...I would expect you of all people to understand.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...Understand what?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This kingdom's legal system... Mrs. Inmee's crime... Your suicide... It can't be... That would be sadder than sad.
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I believe the defense knows of what the high priest speaks.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, I finally understand. <textEffects>This explains why the high priest took his own life!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
...The <textEffects>Defense Culpability Act</textEffects>. Circumstantial evidence supports Mrs. Inmee's killing of Acolyte Zeh'lot in self-defense. However, it would be next to impossible to prove it without a lawyer. That's why the high priest wanted to pin the crime on Maya Fey.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
...I fail to see what that has to do with his suicide.
</line><line>Phoenix:
In Khura'in, the <textEffects>Divination Séance</textEffects> is the most important piece of trial evidence. The high priest wanted to frame Ms. Fey as a serial killer. It was a clever plan in which he made sure he'd see Lady Kee'ra in his final moments.
</line><line>Tahrust:
...The lawyer speaks true. That is why I placed Lady Kee'ra's robes upon the warbaa'd statue. I made it seem that Acolyte Fey was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra.

</line><line>Rayfa:
B-But...! Are you saying you used my Divination Séance to produce false evidence?
</line><line>Tahrust:
Forgive me, Your Benevolence. ...But it was the only way to help my lovely wife.
</line><line>Phoenix:
If you had approached me first, I could have proved that the murder was in self-defense.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Perhaps... But I had little faith in lawyers, despite being a rebel.
</line><line>Nahyuta:
How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime!
</line><line>Tahrust:
Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been...
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Poor Rayfa... She's really taking this hard. But I can't say I'm surprised.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Tahrust:
Mr. Phoenix Wright. It is time to show the might of your legal prowess! You mustn't allow another innocent soul to be charged under that despicable law.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Of course. I'll do whatever I can.
</line><line>Tahrust:
What I have done to you and Acolyte Fey is unforgivable. I can only offer my most humble of apologies. Your Magistry...
</line><line>Judge:
Yes?
</line><line>Tahrust:
I ask that you please look after my wife.
</line><line>Judge:
You have my word.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Your Benevolence, it is time that I return to the Twilight Realm. The Magatama of Parting, if you please...
</line><line>Rayfa:
...............Very well.

</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Your Benevolence. Please, allow me the honor.
</line><line>Rayfa:
...Y-Yes, it would be more fitting for you to send him on his way.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Mrs. Inmee...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Darling... I'm so glad I was able to see you one last time. Thank you... for everything.
</line><line>Tahrust:
I'm sorry to leave you like this, my love...
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
But now you can watch over me from the world beyond.
</line><line>Tahrust:
Yes, always and forever...
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
And with every breath I take, my darling, I'll be thinking of you.
</line>

<line>Beh'leeb:
Farewell, my darling Tahrust.

<line>Maya:
...The high priest has returned to the Twilight Realm.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya!
</line><line>Maya:
I feel great! I guess that means he didn't leave any regrets behind. Oh...! But what about the trial, Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It's over. It was a sad reality born of love, and a great tragedy born of the Defense Culpability Act.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I see no need to continue this trial. Does the prosecution have anything to say?
</line><line>Nahyuta:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... I owe a debt to you -- one that I will pay back in court someday.
</line><line>Judge:
Now, to deliver today's verdict, and overturn that of yesterday's trial. With respect to all current and previous charges against them... ..I hereby declare the accused, Maya Fey, and her defense, Phoenix Wright...

<line>Maya:
So, I was thinking, Nick... The legal system here is really stacked against the defense. It's totally unfair!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Yeah, it even forced the high priest to make the ultimate sacrifice just to protect his wife.
</line><line>Maya:
It's just so sad...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Protect the status quo, or join the revolution... If the real Lady Kee'ra were here, I wonder which side she would take.
</line><line>Rayfa:
........................
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Benevolence...
</line><line>Rayfa:
Huh?! What?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was, uhh... just wondering. Are you all right?
</line><line>Rayfa:
Quiet, you! How could I possibly be all right?! ........................
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Yeah, she's not doing well at all...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
......Who do you think you are -- suddenly appearing before me... ...trampling my Insights underfoot, and plunging the Hall of Justice into utter chaos! You even desecrated my mother and father's teachings, you... soulless infidel!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oof, that was a bit more extreme than usual.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
........................... What am I to do...? I had always believed that communing with a victim's mitamah... ...would lead me to the absolute truth. But each time you overturned my Insights... ...it was revealed that they served to support false charges, rather than the truth. I am left now with that heavy truth in my heart.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'm sorry, Rayfa...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
Perhaps I am not worthy of hearing the voices of the mitamah.
</line><line>???:
That's where you're wrong, Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Rayfa:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Maya?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Rayfa:
How dare you--?!
</line><line>Maya:
Your role is to bring forth the voices of the mitamah into our world. If you don't do it, who will?
</line><line>Rayfa:
You know nothing, Maya Fey! It was spirit channeling, not a Divination Séance that brought the truth to light. How... How DARE an outsider like you employ the queen's secret art! But what can I do?! My spiritual power does not even approach yours! Ha ha ha ha! Is it not a cruel joke?! The royal priestess, bested by a lowly outsider?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't be so hard on yourself.
</line><line>Rayfa:
Why not?! It is worth at least a laugh or two!
</line><line>Maya:
...You shouldn't talk like that!
</line><line>Rayfa:
Huh?!
</line><line>Maya:
Listen, Your Benevolence... You were just fulfilling your duty, weren't you? And you're the only one capable of performing the Divination Séance, right? The station of royal priestess is not something to abandon lightly!
</line><line>Rayfa:
...The station of royal priestess?
</line><line>Maya:
The people of your kingdom believe in you. But if you really mean all that you just said... ...then what are they supposed to believe in?
</line><line>Rayfa:
! Y-You know naught of what you speak!
</line><line>Maya:
...Actually, I kinda do. After all, I'm only here training so I can become the master of my village back home.
</line><line>Rayfa:
A village master, you say? ...I did not know. It seems I owe you an apology. For even today, I called you a neophyte practitioner.
</line><line>Maya:
It's all right, Your Benevolence. Thank you for finally acknowledging me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A future queen and a future village master? I guess it shouldn't be a surprise... ...considering they may have had a common ancestor.)</textEffects> Maya's right, Your Benevolence.
</line><line>Rayfa:
B-Barbed Head?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Insights were a crucial piece of evidence in this last trial. It doesn't matter if they weren't always one hundred percent accurate. You should be proud of what you did. You've played an important role in assuring that justice was served.
</line><line>Rayfa:
..................... Hmm...
</line><line>Phoenix:
And besides, your Insights aren't the problem here. It's your kingdom's legal system. Without lawyers, your Insights have come to be accepted as the sole truth. And the <textEffects>Defense Culpability Act</textEffects>, which gave rise to that, is the root of it all.
</line><line>Rayfa:
B-But that is the dangerous thinking of a rebel!
</line><line>Maya:
...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.
</line><line>Rayfa:
.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.
</line><line>Maya:
Knowing you, Your Benevolence, you're more than capable.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...I've never heard Maya talk like this before. She's really come a long way.)</textEffects> 
</line>
<captions aligned="center"><textEffects>*BOOOOM*</textEffects></captions>
<line>Phoenix:
Wh-What was that?
</line><line>Bailiff:
It came from the hallway! Smoke! We'd better go check it out! Hurry!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Mrs. Inmee!
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
Mr. Wright, Acolyte Fey... I'm so sorry for what transpired. You were almost sentenced to death because of me. I will make amends by picking up where my husband left off. I will see the revolution through, so nothing like this can ever happen again! For that is the depth of my love for my dearly departed husband!
</line><line>Datz:
Lady Inmee, we gotta hurry!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That voice... Is that Mr. Are'bal?
</line><line>Beh'leeb:
I must tell the people! They must learn that the peace we enjoy is a false one! One built on the backs of innocents charged with false crimes under that odious DC Act! We have it in our power to forge a society in which the law judges all of us fairly!
</line><line>Datz:
Hey there, PW! I wish we had more time to talk, but...! Dhurke! Everything's ready! It's go time!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Dhurke?
</line><line>Dhurke:
.....................
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait, was that the rebel leader Dhurke?!
</line><line>Bailiff:
After 'em! Don't let them get away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The power to forge a society in which the law judges all of us fairly... It's the start of a legal <span style="color:#E16935">revolution</textEffects>...)</span>
</line><line>Maya:
..................... Hey, Nick! Hate to bother you while you're lost in thought... ...but I just got this great idea!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
</line><line>Maya:
"<textEffects>The Steel Samurai vs. The Rebel Dhurke</textEffects>"! I bet it'd make for another awesome TV show! And if we threw the Plumed Punisher in there...! Everyone would go nuts over it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(............I'll never get what she sees in those shows. But it's good to know that no matter what happens, Maya will always be Maya.)</textEffects>
