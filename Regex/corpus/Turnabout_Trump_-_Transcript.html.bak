Showdown time.
</line><line>...You lose.
</line><line>Auuuuuuuugh!
</line><line>Eeeeeeeeeek!
</line><line>...I seem to be in a bit of trouble.
</line><line>Something like that.
</line><line>...Dead. Someone hit him. Hard.
</line><line>Me? Please. The cops should be here any minute.
</line><line>I'm in your hands... Should it come to that.

Apollo:
<textEffects>(Panicked... Palms sweaty... I can admit it. I'm nervous.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
Ah, good morning!
</line><line>Apollo:
G-Good morning, sir!
</line><line>Kristoph:
You look tense, Justice. Wound up tight.
</line><line>Apollo:
W-Wound up, sir? No! I'm loose! I'm fine!
</line><line>Kristoph:
That screeching noise... Is that your voice? I suppose it's to be expected... Your first trial, and it's a homicide. I guess "Justice" doesn't start small, eh?
</line><line>Apollo:
I-I'm fine! I got up at 5 AM to do my "Chords of Steel" voice workout! I'm fine!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Ah, that explains it. I did detect a certain rasping quality to your screech.
</line><line>Apollo:
...*cough* <textEffects>(I overdid it again...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kristoph:
As you know, your client today is a good friend of mine. I wouldn't want to let him down... if you get my drift.
</line><line>Apollo:
Drift gotten, sir! I-I'm all over that drift!
</line><line>Kristoph:
As it happens, I dined with him the night of the murder. We can't let this case fall through.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. Yes! I'm fine, sir!
</line><line>Kristoph:
One more thing. Don't say you're fine quite so much. People might take you the wrong way.
</line><line>Apollo:
*gulp*
</line><line>Kristoph:
I'll be preparing our case. You might want to introduce yourself to the client.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
My name is Apollo Justice. If it isn't clear already, I'm a new attorney. And today is my first trial. N-Not that I'm worried or anything! The defendant has been accused of... <textEffects>murder</textEffects>. My boss wants to help him out, of course... and so do I! I mean, there's no way he did it. Not him! No way!
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
Whoa!
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
Good uh, morning!
</line><line>???:
... Morning. It's all up to you today.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(First trial: nervous. Meeting him: cardiac arrest.)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
... <textEffects>(I think I'm supposed to say something... Uh... help?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
So, you're...
</line><line>Apollo:
Fine! I-I'm fine!
</line><line>???:
Ah... Mr. Fine, is it?
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh.
</line><line>???:
I did remember you having an odd name.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Well, we're off to a great start.)</textEffects> Um... Are you sure you're OK, I mean, with me?
</line><line>???:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Gavin is a top-notch defense attorney. And he's your friend! So why...
</line><line>???:
... You'll see.
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh?
</line><line>???:
You can do it. Be confident.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, I... I'm really sorry this happened to you. I mean... I mean, I...
</line><line>???:
It's time. Shall we?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir! <textEffects>(...OK. I need to focus. First trial, here comes Justice!)</textEffects>

<line>
Judge:
The court is now in session.
</line><line>Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, the defense is, uh, fine! I mean ready, Your Honor! <textEffects>(Mind going blank... Don't panic... Ack, too late!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Your name was... Mr. Justice? And this is your first trial?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! But I'm fine! Really!
</line><line>Judge:
Are you quite sure? Your voice sounds a bit strained.
</line><line>Apollo:
...*cough*
</line><line>Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
I was under the impression that you would be heading up this case...?
</line><line>Kristoph:
That was my intention, yes. However... A defense attorney must always cede to his client's wishes. And my client specifically requested Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, of course he wants justice! But to entrust his case to this greenhorn... Why? I do not exaggerate when I say that you're the best defense attorney in town, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(OK, so Gavin's got trial experience, fine. But does he have Chords of Steel!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Then let's begin. The defendant may enter the courtroom.
</line>
<hr />
<line>???:
...
</line><line>Judge:
This is truly an unfortunate turn of events. I'm sorry we had to meet again under these circumstances. Long time no see, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's put the past behind us, shall we? These days, I'm merely Phoenix Wright, piano player.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Mr. Wright... How could this have happened?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
I won't speak of it further then. If the prosecution would be so kind as to explain the charges. Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
To think, I saw you enter this room a fresh attorney, and now I'll see you leave in chains.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, Winston Payne. Subtle as ever, I see.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Payne:
Ahem. The crime occurred at the <textEffects>Borscht Bowl Club</textEffects>... a Russian restaurant. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, took the victim, a customer... ...and he hit him! Wham! On the head! Smack! Killed him cold.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... A customer at the restaurant, you say? And the defendant, you say he was...?
</line><line>Payne:
The pianist for the club, it seems.
</line><line>Judge:
Phoenix Wright... A pianist?
</line><line>Payne:
This is the weapon that took the victim's life. A bottle of grape juice. Grape juice is apparently our defendant's drink of choice.
</line><line>Judge:
The court accepts the deadly bottle as evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Deadly Bottle added to the Court Record.</textEffects>

<line>Kristoph:
Something to note, Justice. All evidence is filed in the <textEffects>Court Record</textEffects>. Make a practice of checking it frequently.
</line><line>Apollo:
The <textEffects>Court Record</textEffects>... Right! I've heard of that!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Use the <textEffects>Court Record Button</textEffects> to look at the evidence so far. I'm confident in your ability to handle this.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Right, the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record Button</textEffects>. Sounds like it's time for some hands-on action!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
So, the victim was a customer at this restaurant. But just who was this, erm, "Shadi Smith" fellow?
</line><line>Payne:
We believe he was a traveler, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
A... traveler?
</line><line>Payne:
According to his passport, he had been out of the country for a number of years. He had only returned to this country recently, though his place of residence is unclear.
</line><line>Judge:
And he had some sort of connection with the defendant?
</line><line>Payne:
...That, too, is unclear at present, Your Honor. We believe they first met at the Borscht Bowl Club on the night of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
If they had only just met, then why murder? Perhaps the victim slighted the defendant's piano playing?
</line><line>Payne:
That doesn't appear to have been the case. No, the motive had nothing to do with the defendant's lack of playing skill. At least not piano playing. I'll let this photo explain what I mean. As we can see, a game of <textEffects>poker</textEffects> was in progress at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Wait a second! Isn't poker gambling? That's a crime in and of itself!
</line><line>Payne:
Indeed. It appears our defendant... ...has fallen to become the basest sort of criminal!

</line><line>Kristoph:
It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A <textEffects>competition</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Payne:
A... competition?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.
</line><line>Judge:
... Er, come again?
</line><line>Payne:
The cards on the table had blue backs, Your Honor. I believe the defense was waxing poetic in an attempt to mystify those present... ...and impress women.
</line><line>Judge:
That will be our first order of business here then: To find out more about this fatal game of cards.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Very well, Defendant.
</line><line>Judge:
You will testify to the court about the poker <textEffects>competition</textEffects> held the night of the crime.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...My pleasure.

<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Competition --</textEffects></center>
<line>Phoenix:
I am a pianist by trade... yet I can hardly play at all.
My real job is to take on interested customers over at the poker table.
The room where we play and the competition in there are the club's main attractions.
The rules are simple: we play a game of poker using two decks of cards.
That's all it is... a game. And our customers are happy.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
...Hmm. A pianist who can't play piano?
</line><line>Payne:
Better than a defense attorney who can't defend.
</line><line>Judge:
... Very well. The defense may begin the <textEffects>cross-examination</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
R-Right, Your Honor! <textEffects>(My first <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examination!</textEffects> Don't blow it!)</span>
</line><line>Kristoph:
Are you alright? You're sweating bullets.
</line><line>Apollo:
Bullets...!? Where!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
It's a figure of speech, Justice. Your voice sounds strained and raspy, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
My brain feels strained and raspy, sir.
</line><line>Kristoph:
You've watched me perform cross-examinations many times. Though you've never done one yourself, have you? Care for a refresher?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What to do? Should I ask Mr. Gavin for a refresher course in <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examination</textEffects>?)</span>
</line>


<line>Kristoph:
Find any <textEffects>inconsistencies</textEffects>, any <textEffects>lies</textEffects> in the <textEffects>testimony</textEffects>, and reveal them to the court. That is <textEffects>cross-examination</textEffects>. Learn it. Know it. Do it.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>("<span style="color:#E16935">Inconsistencies</textEffects>"? "<textEffects>Lies</textEffects>"? Phoenix Wright...? As if! Phoenix Wright would never lie, and it's up to me to prove it.)</span>

Hee hee hee... Too bad our new defense attorney never learned how to play dumb!

What's this, Mr. Payne?

I examined the bottle in question, you see. And it was covered with the defendant's fingerprints!

<textEffects>Objection!</textEffects>

No need to shout, Mr. Justice! I can hear you just fine!

Excess yelling can damage the judge's ears... and our case.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(B-But what about my Chords of Steel...?)</textEffects> Any... Anyway! What's so strange about fingerprints on a bottle in a restaurant?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, that's true. The prints alone don't prove he did it--

</line><line>Payne:
Oh, they wouldn't prove a thing... if they were normal fingerprints!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Huh!?
</line><line>Payne:
But the fingerprints on the murder weapon were <textEffects>upside-down</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
"Upside-down"? What does that mean?
</line><line>Payne:
It means he was holding the bottle inverted! And there can be only one reason for that! ...Yes. To brain someone with the bottle!
</line><line>Apollo:
Auuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! M-Mr. Gavin! I think things just took a turn for the worse!
</line><line>Kristoph:
...Oh? I see no problem, Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Kristoph:
The only thing that matters is the truth. There's a good reason for everything. You'll see.
</line><line>Judge:
Defendant! Can you explain your fingerprints on this bottle to the court!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I stand by my plea of silence regarding the murder. ...For now.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Not very cooperative, are you? This could hurt your case.
</line><line>Payne:
I'm sure he's uncooperative because he's hiding something! There must be some <textEffects>reason</textEffects>...

</line><line>Kristoph:
...Your Honor. You seem to have forgotten something.
</line><line>Judge:
And what might that be, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
On the night of the crime, who was it who reported the murder to the police?
</line><line>Judge:
Reported...?
</line><line>Payne:
Well, that was the <textEffects>defendant</textEffects>, <textEffects>Mr. Wright</textEffects>. But still, that...
</line><line>Judge:
R-Really!?
</line><line>Payne:
Erm, yes, well. According to the case file... The murder was reported from near the scene, by a call from the <textEffects>defendant's cell phone</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
"Near" the scene...?
</line><line>Payne:
Let's take a look at a diagram of the murder scene, shall we? The victim was murdered in a small room in a basement two floors down from ground level. Of course, cell phones can't get reception so far down. The defendant used the stairs in this hallway to go above ground... The call came from the first floor of the restaurant.
</line><line>Judge:
I see... And this is the phone that made the call?

<line>Kristoph:
The defendant could have just fled the scene of the crime if he so chose. Yet, he fulfilled his duty as a citizen and reported it to the authorities. And you claim he is being "uncooperative"...?

Urk.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Nice save, Mr. Gavin! I'd better not waste this!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kristoph:
...I think the prosecution has toyed with our client enough for the time being.
</line><line>Payne:
T-Toyed? I assure you, no one is more serious about...
</line><line>Kristoph:
What was it you said? The defendant was "in the room the very moment that the crime occurred". How can you possibly know this?
</line><line>Judge:
That's a good question! How indeed!
</line><line>Kristoph:
The answer is simple, Your Honor. The prosecution has a decisive witness.
</line><line>Payne:
Hee hee hee. You're as good as they say you are.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So someone else was in the room the night of the crime! That must mean they <span style="color:#E16935">witnessed</textEffects> the crime...)</span>
</line><line>Kristoph:
Everything up till now has been a warm-up, Justice. Are you ready?
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The prosecution may call its first witness to the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Payne:
The witness will state her name and profession.
</line><line>Judge:
H-Hold on just a moment! Where's the witness?
</line><line>Payne:
I surmise that she has been frightened by the defense's demonic-looking horns.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So I used a little hair gel! Relax, people!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Have no fear! If any horns point in your direction this court will cut them off.
</line><line>???:
... You... are sure?
</line><line>Judge:
I swear it on my gavel! Please, come out.
</line><line>Apollo:
Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor?
</line><line>???:
Well, if you are sure it is OK...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Ahem. Now, the prosecution... W-W-Wait a minute! Would the prosecution care to explain the witness's... erm... paraphernalia?
</line><line>Payne:
Er... yes. She is a professional, Your Honor. Those are merely the tools of her trade.
</line><line>Judge:
And that would be...?
</line><line>Olga:
My name... is Olga Orly. I am employed as waitress in Borscht Bowl Club restaurant.
</line><line>Judge:
Then... why the camera?
</line><line>Olga:
Of course, it is my pride to serve borscht that is naming restaurant. But I also perform -- how it is said? Other service.
</line><line>Judge:
I take it one of these other services is taking the customers' pictures?
</line><line>Olga:
Dah, dah. Like, for example... this one.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-That's... the <textEffects>defendant</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Payne:
Indeed. On the night of the murder.
</line><line>Olga:
Man in white hat... is one who has gone kaput.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... That is the victim. Order! Order! This is quite a piece of evidence to casually drop into our laps!
</line><line>Olga:
It is same way as I drop cold bowls of borscht on laps of customers... casually.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Then the court will casually accept this new evidence.
</line><line><textEffects>Olga's Photo added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Now, witness. Where were you at the time of the murder?
</line><line>Olga:
I was in room. <textEffects>The Hydeout</textEffects>, we call it.
</line><line>Apollo:
Excuse me? The Hydeout?
</line><line>Olga:
It is room where famous gangster "Badgai" was arrested. Is room where murder took place.
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Olga:
Your look of utter surprise... It is lovely. I will post by courtroom door later for you! Dah, dah, photos will be numbered, and you will write which ones you want copy of.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(So there were <span style="color:#E16935">three people</textEffects> in the room at the time of the crime... The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... ...Olga Orly, our witness! ...And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer, that means...!)</span>

</line><line>Kristoph:
Ahem. Justice? Maybe you can come up with a more legitimate objection?
</line><line>Apollo:
But! He hadn't lost in seven years!
</line><line>Payne:
Take it from me kid. It happens. I didn't lose a case my first seven years as prosecutor, either. Incidentally. I have some evidence here. These are the poker chips as they lay the very moment of the crime. The hand and chips on this side belong to the defendant, Mr. Wright. Those on the far side belonged to the victim, Mr. Smith.
</line><line>Judge:
Chips... you say?
</line><line>Payne:
Dah. I mean yes! Imagine that poker is war... Your hand is your army, and the <textEffects>chips</textEffects> are the spoils.
</line><line>Judge:
I-I know that. After all, in my youth I was known as... ...the "Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3"!

Right, sir! Leave it to me! <textEffects>(There were only three people in the room at the time of the murder. The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer... I've got you now, Orly!)</textEffects>

<textEffects>(You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said. But what does it mean?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice, would you care to explain what it is you're thinking so intensely about?
</line><line>Apollo:
Recall the testimony, Your Honor... The victim played with "his hand on locket at his neck", I believe she said?
</line><line>Payne:
I hope you aren't about to raise an objection to the witness's grammar!
</line><line>Apollo:
No, but look at this photograph. Do you see a locket on the victim's neck?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Well done, Justice. I'm impressed. I knew you'd be able to handle this.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But what does it mean?
</line><line>Judge:
If we are to believe this witness's testimony as-is... Then the locket "disappeared" following the victim's death.
</line><line>Apollo:
Lockets don't just "disappear", Your Honor!
</line><line>Kristoph:
It's quite simple when you think about it. If the locket is gone, someone must have taken it off, no?
</line><line>Apollo:
Taken it off... Wait, you don't mean...!
</line><line>Kristoph:
The defendant wasn't <textEffects>strangling the victim</textEffects> at all. He was <textEffects>taking off his locket</textEffects>! ...Wouldn't that explain it?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Payne:
Urk...?
</line><line>Judge:
D-Defendant! What do you have to say to this?
</line><line>Phoenix:

... Say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
I just noticed this, but... You have something hanging around your neck, don't you.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? You mean this? Yes, it's a locket... with a photograph inside. A photo... of my daughter.
</line><line>Apollo:
C-Come again?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright! You have a daughter!?
</line><line>Payne:
We confirmed it at the time of the arrest. The picture in the locket is indeed Mr. Wright's daughter.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...

<textEffects>(So Mr. Wright has a locket, too...? Why don't I buy that this is just a coincidence...?)</textEffects>

Well now, if the results of this poker game led to the murder... Perhaps we should hear a bit more about the outcome of the game?

...Nyet. As I have been saying before, it was game, not gambling. Hard perhaps for capitalist to understand. Two types of chip: <textEffects>100 points</textEffects> chip and <textEffects>1,000 points</textEffects> chip. It is not money, dah.

</line><line>Payne:
It seems our new attorney is a bit confused... A glance at the picture is enough to tell you who won! If you're not in kindergarten.
</line><line>Judge:
Um... Just for safety's sake, could you explain the problem to the court?
</line><line>Apollo:
Of course, Your Honor. In this photo I see small chips and I see large chips. Tell me.. which were worth <textEffects>1,000 points</textEffects>?
</line><line>Payne:
Why, the big ones of course! Duh!
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh, I thought so too... but then the totals don't add up.
</line><line>Payne:
Th-The totals...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Let's review what the witness told us: Each man started with 3,500 points in chips. And the combined total value of the chips was 7,000 points.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes... if my calculations are correct! Let's see, three plus one, carry the five...
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, they are, Your Honor. Now! Look at this photo that allegedly shows <textEffects>all the chips</textEffects>. If the big chips are worth 1,000 points, and the small chips are worth 100... And you add them up...
</line><line>Payne:
How much is it!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Do it yourself... You aren't in kindergarten, are you?)</textEffects> ...10,600 points. The chips don't add up! This clearly contradicts the witness's testimony!
</line><line>Payne:
B-But why!? How could this be!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Exactly... Justice. Now that you know the "what", you must determine the "why".
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
Each man began the game with 3,500 points. If all the chips are indeed shown in this photograph... Then there can be only one answer.
</line><line>Judge: 
Well, what is it?
</line><line>Apollo:
The value of the chips... was the <textEffects>other way around</textEffects>!
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Want to know what I think? The small chips were worth 1,000 points, not the big ones!
</line><line>Payne:
Madness! Utter madness!
</line><line>Judge:
Show me that photograph of the chips again! ...There are six small chips, and ten large chips... Why, that does make 7,000 points when you add them up!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Excellent work, Justice. It's almost as though you figured it out by yourself.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well... I'm just glad I was the one who said it.

</line><line>Payne:
B-But wait! The value of the chips may be different, but that changes nothing!!!
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed.. The victim did have the larger number of chips still. ... Ah!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Exactly. If the small chips are 1,000 points, and the large chips are 100... Let's do a little math. Add up the points for each side of the table!
</line><line>Payne:
Ah... Auuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
</line><line>Judge:
The victim, Mr. Smith, had 2,900 points, and the defendant had... 4,100 points!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well now... It seems that Mr. Wright was winning that night after all!
</line><line>Payne:
That's... impossible!

...Justice. You know the terms "one pair", "two pair", and "three of a kind", yes?

Uh, yeah! No problem! Two cards with the same number makes a pair, and three makes a three of a kind!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Good. Now picture a hand with one pair, and one three of a kind. That's a <textEffects>full house</textEffects>.

Take another look at the evidence! As you can see, the defendant also had two aces in his hand. Where's this fifth ace? I see cheating alright, and it's going on right here in this courtroom!

Two aces in each player's hand does make four aces total. Hardly proof of cheating...

What nonsense is the defendant spewing now!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Think. One of the cards had a different colored back. Don't you wonder what it means?
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What are you doing, Mr. Wright!? Raising objections right when you're about to get off the hook!? Ridiculous!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Payne, you of all people should know... Mr. Wright has a talent... for the ridiculous! Perhaps we should get to the bottom of things. Let's clear up the facts about the game that fateful night.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
As was said before... We alternated between <textEffects>two decks of cards</textEffects> that night.
</line><line>Payne:
That was said before!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The two decks at the club have different colored backs: <textEffects>Blue</textEffects>... and <textEffects>red</textEffects>. One color per deck.
</line><line>Apollo:
Why use different colored backs?
</line><line>Phoenix:
If we used the same color, the two decks might get mixed.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Um, you used different colors and they STILL got mixed up.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
We used the <textEffects>red</textEffects> deck for the last game.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I see. But... that's odd. For some reason... I have this impression that you were using the <textEffects>blue</textEffects> cards!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Yeah, me too... I'm sure someone said something about blue cards...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
Whatever. In the end one card of the wrong color got into the mix... Which means there was cheating.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, a card slipped into the deck would seem to indicate cheating... Yet... this card raises two serious questions. ...Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's consider the first question, shall we? Think. In the last game... when was the card swapped?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>("When"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
There are three broad possibilities here. It could have been swapped <textEffects>before the murder</textEffects>, <textEffects>during the murder</textEffects>... or <textEffects>after the murder</textEffects>.
</line><line>Payne:
Well, yeah! Thanks for the news bulletin, Mr. Wright! Of course it was swapp--
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? It might be as simple as you think, Mr. Payne. Or it might not be.
</line><line>Payne:
Nnnk!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'd like to hear what Apollo thinks first... When do you think the cards were swapped?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(<span style="color:#E16935">When</textEffects> was the card swapped into the deck?)</span>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
Perhaps it happened... <textEffects>after</textEffects> the murder?
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What's that? Ridiculous! What's the point of cheating after the hands have been shown? That's silly!
</line><line>Apollo:

</line><line>Apollo:
Yes! But tell me... How do you swap cards during the game!? I'll take "silly" over "impossible".
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Take it from me, son. There's a lot of silly in this world, but very little impossible.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh? Even when the backs of the cards are a different color!? If you pulled that during the game, you'd be caught in no time!
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Quite true. That would mean that the blue card in question... ...was swapped <textEffects>after</textEffects> the hands were shown, <textEffects>after</textEffects> the murder!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
OK, this is going past silly and straight on to crazy. I ask again: what's the point of cheating <textEffects>after</textEffects> the game's over!? Who would do that!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who indeed. That's one of the mysteries before us.
</line><line>Judge:
Th-There's another?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. A simple, yet decisive question must be asked: Who swapped the red card for a blue card?
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-Who?
</line><line>Kristoph:
The game, and murder, is done. The victim is dead. Only two remain in the room. Alive, that is. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and our witness, Olga Orly.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Apollo:
The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course. And, well, it doesn't seem like it could have been Olga Orly, either...
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What are you suggesting!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
That's hardly a logical conclusion, I'll admit. As the defense, I think it only makes sense for you to name Ms. Orly at this point.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, yes, I know! But... But she was the one who dealt the cards, right? I... I just can't believe she would make the mistake of swapping the wrong color card!
</line><line>Judge:
And if the card was swapped during the game, it'd be obvious...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heh. Heh heh heh heh.
</line><line>Judge:
Something you'd like to share with the court, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, my apologies, Your Honor. I was just thinking how much fun all this is.
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Fun!? How about confusing!? I've no idea what the defense is claiming, Your Honor. If the one who swapped the card wasn't the defendant, and it wasn't Ms. Orly... Then who was it!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Er, yeah, well, that is the question, isn't it?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Precisely.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe we're about to see this case take... a new direction.
</line><line>Judge:
A new direction?
</line><line>Phoenix:
We'll find that, indeed, after the murder... ...someone swapped one of the cards in the victim's hand. And that someone made two critical mistakes.
</line><line>Kristoph:
I'm sure you're going to tell us that the first was swapping the wrong color card.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Because the one who did the swap didn't know two colors of cards were being used. The other mistake... was the <textEffects>number</textEffects> on the card.
</line><line>Apollo:
Right... The person replaced the fifth ace with a king.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm sure whoever swapped it wasn't expecting there to be a fifth ace, after all. All they knew was that the game had been won with a full house. So they picked up a king from the table, and swapped it in.
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
B-But! There's one problem... According to our case record this person doesn't exist!!!
</line><line>Phoenix:
True, not until now. But you have to admit the possibility of a <textEffects>fourth person</textEffects>. Though it's more than a possibility. There was <textEffects>someone else</textEffects> there that night at the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
I believe the judge spoke truthfully earlier. You do make trials... ridiculous, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Judge:
This trial has proceeded on one central assumption: namely, that, at the time of the incident, there were only three people in that room.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe this new evidence, shall we say... overturns that assumption?
</line><line>Judge:
The problem is that you chose to conceal this information from the court!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...I suppose that is a problem, yes.
</line><line>Judge:
Court is adjourned for a brief recess! Mr. Gavin, I'll see you in my chambers during this recess.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...Certainly, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well! The trial will resume in twenty minutes!

Kristoph:
That was quite... unexpected, Mr. Wright. To suddenly claim there was another person at the scene of the crime like that... I must ask... is it the truth?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well now... I'd think you would know the answer to that?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Ah, being mysterious, are we? Sadly, I've no time for mysteries. I'd only ask that you leave the defending to your defense, in the future. Otherwise... I cannot guarantee the outcome.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I see you haven't mellowed out one bit, Kristoph.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir!
</line><line>Kristoph:
The judge has summoned me to his chambers, so carry on without me.
</line><line>Phoenix:
You did well, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um.. Can I ask you something?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure.
</line><line>Apollo:
That locket you wear... Is that really yours, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, you're wondering about the <textEffects>victim's disappearing locket</textEffects>? Here, you can take a look at it. That's a picture of my daughter in there.
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm... just surprised to hear you had a daughter.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Most people are. Perhaps you'll meet her one of these days.
</line><line>Apollo:
One more question.
</line><line>Apollo:
The one who cheated that night... Was it you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... What do you think?
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You know what happened seven years ago... What I did. It's not unreasonable for you to think I might cheat.
</line><line>Apollo:
I-I never! Honest! But... <textEffects>(It IS odd that he managed to go undefeated for seven whole years...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Want to know something? There's only one game where you can be dealt bad cards all night and still win. Poker.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You see, poker is all about reading your opponent. In that way, it's a lot like a court case.
</line><line>Apollo:
Poker.. is like trial law!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Figure out what your opponent is thinking, and you win.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, yeah, but that's harder than it sounds.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I think not.
</line><line>Apollo:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Try as they might to conceal it, everyone reveals their true thoughts in the end. Their body language can become a valuable source of information.
</line><line>Apollo:
You're kidding!
</line><line>Phoenix:
That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would <textEffects>touch the back of her neck</textEffects> during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice?
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh... No. <textEffects>(C'mon, who'd notice that!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Words, habits, twitches... It's all information for the reading. That's the secret to winning, Apollo. <textEffects>Someone</textEffects> taught me, and now, I pass the secret on to you.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But, I'm not worthy! I mean, there's no way I'll pick up on these "signals".
</line><line>Phoenix:
No. You can do it.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You just don't know it yet.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's he talking about...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
But you will. Soon. Ah, almost forgot. One more thing. About this case... You should know, I haven't told <textEffects>the truth</textEffects> to anyone yet.
</line><line>Apollo:
Whaaaaaaaa--!? <textEffects>(I knew it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
I have my reasons, of course. All shall be revealed. And Apollo... I need you to be there, defending me. I need your <textEffects>power</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
My, um, power? <textEffects>(I had no idea my Chords of Steel were that special...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
...It's time. The real trial begins now. Do your best.

<line>
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. Has our witness, Ms. Olga Orly, recovered?
</line><line>Payne:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! Er, well, she's regained consciousness.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Perhaps we can hear her version of the events again?
</line><line>Payne:
That's the thing... You see, she's quite fatigued.
</line><line>Judge:
You're looking a bit fatigued yourself, Mr. Payne.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Sadly, fatigue is insufficient grounds for refusing to testify... or prosecute. The defense would like to request that Ms. Orly take the stand.
</line><line>Judge:
Very well. The witness will take the stand!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kristoph:
Perhaps you could repeat your name and profession?
</line><line>Olga:
...
</line><line>Kristoph:
Or perhaps you'd rather admit that you're a poor liar, and a poorer loser.
</line><line>Olga:
Ny-Ny-Nye-! ... Not. Name's Olga Orly. That's the truth. I'm a pro dealer. People call me... Olga "Quick-Fingers" Orly!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... Oh really?
</line><line>Olga:
Want to know something else? I'm not really Russian! And my last name sounds like "Oh really"! There, that's the truth! I hope you're satisfied.
</line><line>Apollo:
Witness! You will tell the court what you were really up to that night!
</line><line>Olga:
Fine, I'll talk. We had a <textEffects>plan</textEffects>, see.
</line><line>Judge:
Let me remind you that you are currently under oath. Any further fabrications will have serious consequences.
</line><line>Olga:
... Fine.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Olga:
Like I said, I'm a pro. That guy, Smith, hired me to do what I do best. I was planted at the Borscht Bowl Club several days prior to the night of the game. As a waitress.
</line><line>Apollo:
So you were in <textEffects>cahoots</textEffects> with the victim!
</line><line>Olga:
Not that he needed my help. Smith is a well-known poker player in some circles. But winning wasn't the main purpose of this game. It was about destroying a legend: the unbeatable Phoenix Wright! The plan was simple. Elegant, really. You see, we set up a <textEffects>trap</textEffects> of sorts... I was to <textEffects>plant a card</textEffects> in Wright's pocket beforehand... ...and then deal five aces during one of their games. When their hands were revealed, Smith would call him out and search Wright. He would then pull out the planted card and the trap would snap shut!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>You swapped the cards!</textEffects></center>
<hr />
<line>Olga:
Exposed as a cheater and losing on top of it! It would have made a great double play. Just like that, the legend would be dashed to pieces.
</line><line>Judge:
Indeed... Getting caught red-handed at cheating would cast doubt on all his prior wins...
</line><line>Olga:
A seven-year legend, destroyed by one little card... That was the plan!
</line><line>Kristoph:
"Oh really, Orly"? How droll. But... it appears you made quite the mistake.
</line><line>Judge:
A mistake?
</line><line>Kristoph:
I agree, the trap was elegant. Yet, what happened to that <textEffects>planted card</textEffects>?
</line><line>Apollo:
Hey, that's right!
</line><line>Olga:
He's lucky, I'll give him that. You'd have to be to slip free from a trap laid by Olga "Quick-Fingers" Orly!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh really? The witness would be much cuter if she dispensed with the evil mastermind shtick.
</line><line>Olga:
Cute...? Who wants to be cute? I'm not cute! I'm bad! You hear me? Bad!!!
</line><line>Judge:
When you're through being bad, perhaps you could testify to the court? Tell us about this "<textEffects>trap</textEffects>"... and how it was sprung.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- The Best Laid Traps --</textEffects></center>
<line>Olga:
That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to.
And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!
But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.
The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it!
It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... A surprisingly frank testimony that still leaves us mostly in the dark.
</line><line>Olga:
The trap was perfect I tell you, perfect! If that rotten cheater hadn't messed it up.
</line><line>Apollo:
Look who's talking!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, the testimony, for what it's worth, is all yours, Mr. Justice.

<line>Olga:
<textEffects>And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!</textEffects>

<textEffects>But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.</textEffects>

<line>Olga:

</line>

<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself...
</line><line>Olga:
Un-Unaware of what?
</line><line>Apollo:
Whenever you get to a certain part of your testimony... ...you touch the back of your neck with your left hand!
</line><line>Olga:
...! My... My neck? So... So what!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
What indeed, Justice? I hadn't noticed anything of the sort...
</line><line>Apollo:
When she says that part of the testimony... She's subconsciously recalling <textEffects>something</textEffects>... Her body reacts to the <textEffects>memory</textEffects>, and she touches her neck! I'm sure of it!
</line><line>Payne:
A <textEffects>memory</textEffects>? Would someone care to explain what he's babbling about?
</line><line>Judge:
This is highly unusual... but let's ask the defense. You claim the witness is remembering something. Maybe you have evidence of this "<textEffects>memory</textEffects>" to show us?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Her <span style="color:#E16935">habit</textEffects> is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime... So, what would remind her most of the <textEffects>moment of the crime</textEffects>!?)</span> Ms. Orly. Whenever you recall the crime that night, you scratch your neck. I've noticed it happens when you think about the <textEffects>moment of the crime</textEffects>. There must be some <textEffects>reason</textEffects> behind this "habit" of yours. I believe the weapon that left an inerasable "impression" on your neck is this!
</line>


<line>Apollo:
Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck... And what reminds us more of that moment than this bottle, the murder weapon!
</line><line>Olga:
...!
</line><line>Apollo:
But... something doesn't fit. If you were only the <textEffects>witness</textEffects> to the crime... ...why would that make <textEffects>you</textEffects> touch your neck like you're in pain?
</line><line>Payne:
What's he talking about now!?
</line><line>Apollo:
It was Mr. Smith, the victim who was hit... not <textEffects>you</textEffects>!
</line><line>Olga:

This is a cross-examination, not a cross-wild-conjecture! Th-The witness's... "habits"!? They're completely irrelevant!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Justice... I'll admit, I'm a bit confused myself. This is certainly a... unique cross-examination.
</line><line>Apollo:
I'll explain later! Just, trust me. Now's our only chance to break her! Ms. Orly! Please testify, in detail, about the moment of the crime. The very moment!

<line>Apollo:

</line><line>Kristoph:
I believe you have her where you want her, Justice. The circumstances have changed yet her testimony has not. That means...
</line><line>Apollo:
There's got to be a contradiction in there!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Quite.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said! It states that <textEffects>the police were alerted by a report from the defendant</textEffects>!
</line><line>Olga:
Eh...
</line><line>Apollo:
And we know that the defendant left the room, climbed the stairs... ...and made that phone call from the first floor of the Borscht Bowl Club!
</line><line>Olga:
Ack!
</line><line>Apollo:
So, explain how you kept your eyes on the defendant... ...when he left the room entirely!
</line><line>Olga:
Eeeeeeeeek! ...The man who picked up a bottle and swung it that night... wasn't the defendant.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Showdown time.
</line><line>...You dirty <textEffects>cheat</textEffects>!
</line><line>Check his pockets, now!
</line><line>I-It's gone! The card's gone!
</line><line>...You lose.
</line><line>Auuuuuuuuuugh!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Olga:
Just then, Smith grabbed the bottle from next to Wright... ...and he hit me!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Y-You--! Some master of cheating you turned out to be!!!
</line><line>Eeeeeeeeeeeek!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Olga:
When I came to...
</line><line>Judge:
The victim was already dead... Is that it?
</line><line>Olga:
That's why I couldn't reveal who I really was. If it came out that I was in league with Smith, I'd be a suspect for sure!
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
...
</line><line>Payne:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Well. Where does this leave us?
</line><line>Payne:
M-Madness. Th-This is madness! I'm dreaming! It must have been me who was hit with a bottle and I'm imagining all of this!
</line><line>Judge:
It appears our prosecution is at his wit's end, and frankly, I can't blame him. Mr. Gavin, what do you think about this turn of events?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
M-Mr. Gavin? Sir?
</line><line>Kristoph:
I believe that, as the defense in this case... ...we are compelled to call Ms. Orly a "big, fat liar".
</line><line>Olga:
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Three were in that room the night of the murder: the defendant, victim, and her. ...And she has a <textEffects>motive</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
A motive?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Her plot foiled, the witness got into an argument with her client, Mr. Smith. And the denouement of that argument... was murder!
</line><line>Olga:
What!? I didn't... I'm no killer! It's a trap! Someone's trying to frame me!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Heh heh heh... What tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive. So tangled, we catch ourselves in the process.
</line><line>Judge:
M-Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Such a hasty conclusion... It's not like you, Kristoph Gavin.
</line><line>Kristoph:
What are you saying?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why not consider the other possibility? ...That there was <textEffects>another person in the room</textEffects> at the time of the murder?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Right, like Mr. Wright was saying before recess!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
A single card was swapped into the victim's hand after the murder. And the one who swapped the card didn't know <textEffects>two colors</textEffects> of cards were being used. ...A <textEffects>fourth person</textEffects>.
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Hah, this theory again! Your "fourth person" doesn't exist!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Indeed. That's why I decided to bring this case to court. Here, where there's no escape, and no chance for deception... The perfect place to catch the real criminal.
</line><line>Judge:
The r-real criminal?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And, we're in luck. A clue to the real criminal's identity was kindly provided for us. And right at the beginning of the trial, no less.
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apollo... perhaps you know what I'm talking about?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... sorry.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Remember what I said. The <textEffects>fourth person</textEffects> who swapped the cards made one critical error.
</line><line>Apollo:
He or she wasn't considering the color on the backs of the cards...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right. But how could such an obvious mistake occur? The cards used for the last game were <textEffects>red</textEffects>. Yet, there is one person, here, in our court... ...who thought those cards were <textEffects>blue</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Yeah, I had that impression, too... But why?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, Apollo? Think you can figure out who it was?
</line><line>Payne:
I-It's not me, I swear!
</line><line>Judge:
Who is this <textEffects>fourth person</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Why do I always get put on the spot like this!?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's hear what the defense has to say. Who was it? Who thought the cards used in the final game were <textEffects>blue</textEffects>?
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But of course Mr. Gavin knows the color of the cards!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...How would he? As you can see, the photo of the crime scene is black and white. You can't tell which of the cards are <textEffects>blue</textEffects>: the ones on the floor, or the table.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But look! You can see the colors in this photo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, but when he said the cards were "<textEffects>blue</textEffects>"... ...it was well before this evidence came to light!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kristoph:
It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A <textEffects>competition</textEffects>, Your Honor.
</line><line>Payne:
A... competition?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Well, Kristoph?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr.... Gavin?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Gavin! I-Is something the matter?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Hmm? N-No, nothing. Excuse me, it was just so... sudden. Wright. You aren't seriously accusing me... are you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, Kristoph? You know even I'd never take a joke this far.
</line><line>Payne:

</line><line>Payne:
This has gone beyond ridiculous, beyond dumb... This is insanity! The defendant accusing his own defense attorney of murder?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I assure you, I'm quite sane.
</line><line>Payne:
But what possible connection could Mr. Gavin have to the victim!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I wasn't aware that I had a connection to Mr. Smith, either.
</line><line>Payne:
Yes, but Mr. Gavin and the victim have never even met!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well... What if they have?
</line><line>Payne:
Huh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There is a possibility, after all. They may have met that night, before the game started.
</line><line>Judge:
What are you suggesting!?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Is this the truth Mr. Wright was staying silent about!? Well, only one thing to do!)</textEffects> Mr. Wright! The defense would like to request that you testify to the court!
</line><line>Kristoph:

</line><line>Kristoph:
The defense would like to request no such thing.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Gavin...?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Testimonies must relate to the case. How could anything happening before that game of poker be related?
</line><line>Judge:
I'm not sure I follow, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Kristoph:
As I explained before, the defense believes that Ms. Orly...
</line><line>Judge:
...Am I to assume you speak for Mr. Justice in this? He is the defense, not you.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...!
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Justice. The matter of Mr. Wright's testimony is up to you.
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh... OK. *gulp*
</line><line>Judge:
Does the court, in your opinion, need to hear Mr. Wright's testimony?

<line>Phoenix:
That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph.
Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left.
When the "trap" failed, Smith hit the waitress.
The girl was knocked out cold, and Smith was uncontrollable. I left to call the police.
When I returned, he was dead, blood streaming from a cut on his forehead.
That's when I made another phone call... To Defense Attorney Gavin.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Mr. Gavin! You were at the Borscht Bowl Club the night of the murder!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I dine with him rather frequently.
</line><line>Payne:
A-And he talked to the defendant on the phone directly after the murder!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Quite against my will, I had become involved in a murder. I thought I might be in need of a lawyer, so I called him.
</line><line>Kristoph:
You were planning this all along, weren't you, Wright? Just because you wanted to drag me into your little murder trial...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The only thing I want... is the truth. As I did back then... and now.
</line><line>Kristoph:
I thought my office was doing you a favor when we took on your defense. It appears that I was wrong.
</line><line>Judge:
...Very well. The defense may cross-examine the witness.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
S-Sir!
</line><line>Kristoph:
He's lying, and you're going to expose him.

<hr />
<line>Kristoph:
I believe that's enough of that.
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
This witness's "testimony" is more like a "travesty". It's riddled with lies. I'm beginning to see how you came to lose your attorney's badge seven years ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well. You certainly have a unique way of treating your clients, Kristoph. I never knew.
</line><line>Kristoph:
I believe it was you who threw the first stone...?
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright! If you intend to ever tell the truth about this case... It's now or never!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't be misled... I haven't told a single lie here.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When I noticed the "trap"... I put the card in the bottle to dispose of it. And when I put the hat on the victim's head... Let's just say I had a <textEffects>reason</textEffects> for doing that as well.
</line><line>Judge:
A... reason?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That reason... is right here.
</line><line>Apollo:
Your... cell phone?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That night... Recall that I spoke with Defense Attorney Gavin after calling the police. Just in case, I recorded our conversation.
</line><line>Kristoph:
What's this...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now that we're all here, I see no reason why I shouldn't play it back for the court.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Kristoph. I seem to be in a bit of trouble.
</line><line>Kristoph:
<textEffects>What's this? Game not going well?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Something like that.
</line><line>Kristoph:
<textEffects>That gentleman who challenged you... He turn out to be good?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
He turned out to be dead. Someone hit him. Hard.
</line><line>Kristoph:
<textEffects>You mean someone cracked that flawless bone china pate? It... wasn't you, was it?</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Me? Please. The cops should be here any minute. I'm in your hands... Should it come to that.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
"Bone china plate"...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A kind of porcelain, very smooth and shiny. And not "plate", but "pate". I believe he was referring to a certain gentleman's balding forehead.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... The court appreciates the defendant's discretion in not indicating my forehead.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wait a second... Something's not right about that phone call!)</textEffects> So, after Mr. Gavin ate dinner with you... ...he left the Borscht Bowl Club?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Most certainly.
</line><line>Apollo:
Then... Then how did he know? When did he see this "bone china pate"?
</line><line>Judge:
Oh... That's right!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... That was when I began to see my good friend in a different light.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Troubled, I returned to the crime scene. And when I spotted Mr. Smith's head again, I realized exactly what was wrong. Well, Mr. Gavin. The stage has been set. Perhaps you would like to explain this to the court? Exactly how did you come by your privileged knowledge of the victim's head?
</line><line>Kristoph:
... So, this is your "reason". The reason why you put the victim's hat back on.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your point, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...It's come down to this, has it... Phoenix Wright.
</line><line>Judge:

Is this farce necessary, Your Honor?

Believe me, far stranger things have gone on in this courtroom.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...Fine, I'll play along.
</line><line>Judge:
First, there's one thing we need to have made clear. How did you know about the "<textEffects>secret</textEffects>" beneath the victim's hat?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(By "secret", I'm guessing he means the fact that Mr. Smith was bald.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't call it inordinate, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Apollo:
M-Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Kristoph:
What do you think you're doing, Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wow, things sure look different from the other side. You know what I mean, Apollo? Speaking of "looking from the other side", let's consider something for a second. The victim wore that hat all night, never once taking it off, except for that one time.
</line><line>Apollo:
That one time... being the <textEffects>instant</textEffects> he was hit!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...!
</line><line>Apollo:
When Mr. Wright returned from reporting the crime, the hat was lying on the floor. Mr. Wright picked it up, and placed it on the victim's head... In other words, in order to have seen Mr. Smith's bald head... ...you would have had to be at the scene of the crime... at the time of the crime!
</line><line>Kristoph:
In other words, you'd have to be the <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>... is what you're trying to say.
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Not bad, Apollo.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Eh heh heh...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Gavin...?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...I'm afraid that I haven't been entirely honest with the court.
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What!?

...Oh, I assure you, I had the noblest of intentions. I did it all... to protect my client, Mr. Wright.

...!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Yet, I'm afraid in the current situation I see little reason to hide anything. ...Very well. Allow me to tell you the truth of what happened that night.

Finally! You may begin your testimony. Tell us... How were you involved in the events of that fateful night?

<line>Kristoph:
The rage I sensed in that man that night troubled me... So I returned to the club.
I went down to the basement and peeked in through the little window to the Hydeout.
It must have been right after the murder took place.
The victim was dead, as he appears in the photo.
A bald head, an unconscious girl... and Wright, holding a bottle in his hand.
I sensed that was not the best place for me to be at the time and so I left.
That's when the call came from Wright.

<hr />
<line>Payne:
So... you witnessed the murder!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
For better or worse, I missed the actual moment of the deed.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Gavin, may I remind you that you are on Mr. Wright's defense team... Your testimony is clearly disadvantageous to your client!
</line><line>Kristoph:
What else could I say? I'm standing on the witness stand, after all.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...So you are, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
And you had to testify as you just did... You had to tell them you saw the scene of the crime through that little window...
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You had to say that... ...because that was the only probable window of opportunity. Right, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Oh...
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, the defense should do the cross-examination, not the defendant! Mr. Justice, are you prepared?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor... <textEffects>(I can't believe I'm <span style="color:#E16935">going up against</textEffects> Mr. Gavin... This trial is getting weirder and weirder!)</span>

<textEffects>That's when the call came from Wright.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Phoenix:
Is it going to be a problem for you to cross-examine your own boss?
</line><line>Apollo:
I... I'm fine! <textEffects>(Who was it that taught me never to pull punches in cross-examination? It was you, Mr. Gavin! I learned it from watching you!)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Apollo:
My reason is... uh... This!
</line><line>Payne:
Is that an... ace?
</line><line>Judge:
Why... Why, it's got blood on it! Right next to the spade!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Payne:
This is insane! Why wasn't I told about this!? Why!?
</line><line>Judge:
Could... this be...!? Could this be the missing <textEffects>fifth ace</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
In-Inconceivable! How could you... What are you doing with that card!?
</line><line>Apollo:
Um, well, that's the thing... <textEffects>(Why's Mr. Gavin so upset? It's just a fishy card from some fishy girl...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, that card? It's mine. That is, I picked it up at the Borscht Bowl Club that night after the murder had occurred. I gave it to my daughter. Cards are her stock and trade, after all.

</line><line>Kristoph:
N... No! Impossible! Unacceptable! The court can't accept this evidence! It's a fraud!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A fraud? How can you be so sure?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Wh-What...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would think the only person who could claim it was a fraud... ...would be the one who took the real card from the crime scene... The <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kristoph:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Allow me to elaborate. What if this <textEffects>trace of blood</textEffects> was the reason?
</line><line>Payne:
The reason for...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
For the killer to take the card from the scene of the crime.
</line><line>Judge:
Where are you going with this?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take another look at the photo... and at the victim's head. At the moment of the crime, his hat fell to the floor... ...and a trickle of <textEffects>blood</textEffects> ran from his forehead down the back of his head. Couldn't a drop of that blood have fallen on one of the cards?
</line><line>Apollo:
I suppose...
</line><line>Phoenix:
The killer then took the card to hide the blood.
</line><line>Kristoph:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Kristoph:
R-Regardless! That evidence is non-permissible!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Wright! Regardless of how you wasted the last seven years, you used to be a lawyer! You know what a serious crime it is to conceal evidence!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, we can discuss the finer points of our legal system later... What's important now is that I've answered your question.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Wh-What are you talking about?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You wanted to know why the killer would have taken a card from the crime scene. And now, I've told you. That one drop of blood would have been decisive evidence, you see.
</line><line>Kristoph:

</line><line>Kristoph:
Th-This is... baseless conjecture! Baseless!
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I assure you it's quite based.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's amazing, really. How a single drop of blood on a single card can lead us... to the truth. It's quite simple. Well, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Try picturing the scene of the crime in your head. The murder took place in the Hydeout... The body of the luckless victim was found at the poker table. And, before the killer swapped a card out... ...there was a single card with a drop of blood on it in the victim's hand. Given this... ...there is one, decisive problem with this scene.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, what is it!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card... ...whose <textEffects>position</textEffects> in this diagram doesn't fit? The victim's? The killer's? The witness's? The second witness's? <textEffects>Whose position doesn't fit with the bloody card?</textEffects>
</line>





<line>Apollo:
Well, isn't it the victim's position that's the problem?
</line><line>Judge:
I don't follow your logic here, Mr. Justice.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well... Look, the victim was struck on the head, sending him <textEffects>back</textEffects> in his chair. You'd think any blood would fall <textEffects>behind</textEffects> the body, not onto the table in front of him.
</line><line>Judge:
Ah...!
</line><line>Apollo:
Take a look at the photo again. If he bled in this position... The blood would fall <textEffects>on the floor</textEffects>, not on the cards.
</line><line>Judge:
Why, that's right! So... what does this mean?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Incidentally, we were sitting in <textEffects>swivel chairs</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
S-Swivel chairs!? Oh man...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Apollo, try turning the chair around.
</line><line>Judge:
The chair was facing the <textEffects>other way</textEffects>!?
</line><line>Apollo:
It would have to be. So, we have to assume that at the time of the murder... ...the victim's chair was facing away from the table!
</line><line>Judge:
When Mr. Wright returned from informing the police, which way was the chair facing?
</line><line>Phoenix:
When I came back to the room, the body was facing as seen in this photo.
</line><line>Apollo:
That would mean... the killer turned the chair back around.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's take the next step. Look at the diagram once more. We know now the victim was facing <textEffects>away</textEffects> from the table at the time of the murder. But... this creates another significant contradiction.
</line><line>Payne:
A-Again!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we? Apollo, whose <textEffects>location</textEffects> on this diagram contradicts our new understanding of the crime? The victim's? The killer's? The witness's? The second witness's? <textEffects>Whose location creates a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</textEffects> if the victim was facing away?</span>
</line>





<line>Apollo:
The victim was struck from the front, correct?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Indeed.
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, wouldn't it be hard for the killer to hit him from the front? Sitting where his indicator currently is?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I would think it'd be quite hard, yes.
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
Yes, but what you're saying makes no sense! Why would the victim suddenly turn to face the wall... in the middle of a game!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I believe a sufficient reason will soon come to light.
</line><line>Payne:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's something in this diagram that makes far less sense, actually. Look again at the diagram. Apollo, if the victim was struck while he was sitting as shown here... ...where would his assailant be standing? Try marking it on the diagram.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wha--!? B-But...! <textEffects>(There's no room to put a mark where the killer should be!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't worry... Let's think it through and see what we find. We know the victim was facing toward the wall at the time of the crime. That's the only thing we know for sure. Try to <textEffects>forget about everything else</textEffects>... <textEffects>Where</textEffects> <textEffects>would the killer have to be standing to strike our victim from the front?</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Apollo:
The killer had to be standing, well... uh... Here!
</line><line>Payne:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Payne:
You get points for flair, but that's about all you get.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ack... <textEffects>(I thought I was on to something there, too!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Payne:
I hardly need to point out that standing there would be impossible. The victim is facing a solid <textEffects>cupboard</textEffects>! Or are you claiming the killer climbed the cupboard and hit him from above? Hah!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's <textEffects>simple logic</textEffects>, really... If this was the only place the killer could have been standing... ...then that means that, at the very moment of the crime...
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait! I know! At the moment of the crime, the cupboard... <textEffects>wasn't there</textEffects>!
</line><line>Judge:
What's this now!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I mean, that's the only explanation! Right, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your Honor! I have a suggestion for the defense. We should arrange to examine the cupboard in the Hydeout immediately!
</line><line>Judge:
Bailiff! Send a team to the crime scene immediately! Have them try to move the cupboard!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
What?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There's one more thing your men should look for. Please give this to the bailiff.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...? Mmm, yes... I see. You do belong in the courtroom after all, Mr. Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I do my best. But let's forge ahead here while we wait. Look at the diagram once again. It's been changed. If the killer was standing here at the time of the crime... ...then this cupboard <textEffects>wasn't here</textEffects>. Which means... Apollo, try moving the cupboard. Thank you. As you can see, the cupboard was the problem. At the time of the murder, it has to have been as shown here. Now everything is in place to reconstruct the moment of the crime... Oh, my! What's this...?
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What is it now!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Look at the diagram of the crime scene once more. It appears we've found yet another contradiction... What I believe to be the final contradiction, in fact.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Huh? Oh dang!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Notice something, Apollo? Our line of deduction is rapidly approaching its logical conclusion.
</line><line>Judge:
Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator! Is it the victim? The killer? The witness? The second witness? <textEffects>Which <span style="color:#E16935">indicator</textEffects> in this diagram contradicts what we know about the crime?</span>
</line>





<line>Apollo:
Um, about this cupboard... Are we all OK with assuming it was <textEffects>moved</textEffects>?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sure, why not?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, if it was... something really doesn't fit. The cupboard would completely <textEffects>cover</textEffects> up the window to the stairs!
</line><line>Judge:
Aaah!!!
</line><line>Apollo:
That's right! Someone standing outside wouldn't be able to see in. Someone... like Mr. Gavin!
</line><line>Kristoph:
What... What did you say?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh? Is the "Coolest Defense in the West" losing his cool?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Nnk...! Don't expect me to play along with your little game, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's only a game until someone gets killed, Mr. Gavin. And someone was... while the window to that room was blocked by a cupboard.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
So, Mr. Gavin. Perhaps you'd like to explain to the court. Exactly where did you witness the crime scene from?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Nnn... Nnnk!
</line><line>Bailiff:
Excuse me, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Order!!! This is a court of law and I will have order!
</line><line>Bailiff:
We... We just now received word from our investigative team at the Borscht Bowl Club! They've examined the cupboard in the Hydeout, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Oh...? And what did they find?
</line><line>Bailiff:
Well, Your Honor... It turns out there is a <textEffects>secret passage</textEffects> behind it!
</line><line>Judge:
Whaaaaat!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah yes. I believe I mentioned something of the sort before. This is <textEffects>one of the tricks</textEffects> to the room many of our regulars know about...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I do remember him saying something about that, now that he mentions it.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
A secret passage is a handy thing to have when you're engaged in illegal goings-on. Never know when you might need to duck away from the eyes of the law.
</line><line>Apollo:
So the room has a <textEffects>secret passage</textEffects>. Where does it go?
</line><line>Phoenix:
The other side connects to the restaurant above. The underworld bosses could get away from the cops... And enjoy a cold bowl of borscht, no doubt. Just like our killer. You see where our line of simple deductive reasoning has led us, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I see it, but I don't believe it. That girl wasn't kidding when she said I needed this trump card for the last hand.)</textEffects> At the time of the murder, the window was blocked, and the victim's hat... ...was only off his head for the few minutes between Mr. Smith's murder... ...and Mr. Wright's return from calling the cops. In other words, the only place anyone could've seen the victim's bald head... ...was from <textEffects>inside</textEffects> the Hydeout! ...Well, Mr. Gavin? <textEffects>(Come on, say something!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Dare I ask what really happened that night?
</line><line>Apollo:
Actually, I think we can probably figure it out ourselves at this point. That night, for whatever reason... Our killer had a date with Mr. Smith... A date with destiny. There he crouched, hidden in the secret passageway behind the cupboard... Holding his breath, waiting for just the right moment... Then the chance came... and he took it!
</line>
<hr />
<line><textEffects>Auuuuuuuugh!</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>What... Why did you do that!? Wait here, I'll get help.</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
Ms. Olga Orly was out cold, struck by Mr. Smith... But his time was soon to come. Mr. Wright went upstairs to call the cops. Leaving Mr. Shadi Smith alone in the Hydeout with the unconscious dealer. Then our killer stepped out from the secret passage and into the Hydeout.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The victim must have heard the cupboard sliding aside.
</line><line>Apollo:
He wheeled his chair around to look, and...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...After the deed was done, the criminal must have seen the <textEffects>blood</textEffects> on the card. He would have, of course, realized the need to destroy the evidence. That single spot of blood told <textEffects>the whole story of the crime</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
Too bad for him he didn't linger any longer in the Hydeout that night. If he had, he might have noticed the cards on the floor... And the fact that they were all <textEffects>red</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kristoph:
Nnnrgk!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Well, it seems this trial... ...has taken yet another turn. I'm truly, truly sorry I had to see this day come, Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Gavin...?
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Payne!!!
</line><line>Payne:
Yeeeearrrk!? Ahem. Yes, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution will continue its investigation! As for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the defendant, he is hereby cleared of all suspicion.
</line><line>Payne:
Gwwaaaarrk!?
</line><line>Judge:
Believe me when I say that I don't believe this is happening, Mr. Gavin. But, I'm afraid circumstances call for me to issue a warrant for your arrest. Immediately.
</line><line>Kristoph:

</line><line>Kristoph:
Oh, no need to apologize. I rather enjoyed myself. It's not every day you get to witness a legendary attorney's dirty tactics first hand...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your point, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Frankly, Your Honor, I'm shocked. That a person of your caliber would be taken in by such a low-grade parlor trick...
</line><line>Judge:
Erm... Excuse me?
</line><line>Kristoph:
The defendant is "cleared of all suspicion"...? This is hardly the time for jokes, Your Honor. Mr. Wright hasn't proven anyone's guilt or innocence here. What he has done is use illegal evidence to put the blame on someone else! And not just anyone else, but me, his own defense attorney!
</line><line>Judge:
I-Illegal evidence?
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Let me ask you, Mr. Gavin... Is there still any reason, at present, to suspect me of wrongdoing?
</line><line>Kristoph:
...Of course. This bottle, for instance.
</line><line>Apollo:
The bottle of grape juice Mr. Wright was drinking...
</line><line>Kristoph:
How do you intend to explain away the fingerprints on the murder weapon? And not just any fingerprints, am I right, Mr. Payne?
</line><line>Payne:
Er, a-actually, yes. The fingerprints on the bottle were, erm, <textEffects>upside-down</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
...! <textEffects>(I seem to recall this being an issue earlier...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Kristoph:
The court, and this case, demand an explanation. I can think of only one reason why one would hold a bottle upside-down. ...And that is to hit someone with the bottom of the bottle. Well, Your Honor?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah, see how the caught fish squirms to the last... Well, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Your boss seems awfully concerned about this bottle still... But I'm sure you can come up with a suitable explanation... Just like that.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... Yeah. <textEffects>(Just like what!? Why would anyone grab a bottle upside-down, other than to... *gulp*)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Don't let him trick you into thinking his explanation is the only legitimate one.
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... Is there really another?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Take another look at the Court Record. I believe you'll find a simple answer there... In plain sight.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Um, how about you just say the answer in plain words?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
It... would be hasty to deliver a verdict with unanswered questions, indeed. Well, Mr. Justice?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Mr. Gavin said that the court, and this case, demand an explanation... Don't worry. Justice won't leave until justice is done.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Perhaps the defense would care to enlighten the court? What evidence do you have to explain why the fingerprints on the bottle are upside-down?
</line>


<line>Apollo:
It's actually easier to show you than explain, Your Honor. Place that bottle on the floor, next to your chair.
</line><line>Judge:
Excuse me? On the floor?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes. Now, reach down and pick it up. ...Without getting out of your chair.
</line><line>Payne:
Ah...!
</line><line>Apollo:
See? You naturally go to pick up the bottle by its neck... ...with your fingers <textEffects>upside-down</textEffects>! Look at this photograph taken on the night of the murder. The defendant, Mr. Wright, sat here... ...playing piano, bottles of grape juice on the <textEffects>floor</textEffects> to the side of his piano bench. He would have naturally picked up the bottles upside-down several times.
</line><line>Judge:
Wow! I can't believe it was that simple!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Recall our dinner that evening, Kristoph.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was drinking my usual juice then, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
Basically... you used the bottle on the table to do the deed... But then you must have remembered! So you went and picked up one of the bottles from under the piano... And you switched the bottles! You took one of Mr. Wright's bottles and made it look like the murder weapon!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! Order! What do you have to say to these charges, Mr. Gavin?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Fascinating... So this is the legendary attorney's famed tactic of misdirection...
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What!?
</line><line>Kristoph:
You claim that I switched the bottle? Where is your proof?
</line><line>Apollo:
P-Proof!? Well, that's, uh...
</line><line>Kristoph:
As I thought. More baseless conjecture. I'm afraid your "bottle" of proof is quite empty...
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
</line><line>Kristoph:
...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Your Honor. When you initiated the investigation of the Hydeout earlier... ...do you recall I requested an <textEffects>additional</textEffects> investigation?
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, yes, I have your memo about that here. "<textEffects>Retrieve the bottles from under the piano at the Borscht Bowl Club.</textEffects>" And here's one of the bottles in question.
</line><line>Kristoph:
Hmph! What, are you going to dust that for fingerprints, too? I would be surprised if any were on that but his.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Mr. Gavin probably wouldn't make such a novice mistake, true... That bottle won't bear a trace of anything!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Say, Apollo...
</line><line>Apollo:
Y-Yes!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Why don't you go ahead and examine that bottle.
</line><line>Apollo:
B-But why?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Just humor me.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
That bottle will solve this case once and for all.
</line><line>Apollo:
What!? <textEffects>(That's some bottle!)</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Apollo:
...! There's something inside the bottle! Wh-What's this?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Th-That card...! It can't be...!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Recall that unpleasant woman's testimony for a moment...
</line><line>Apollo:
Er, Ms. Olga Orly?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes, our little swindling devotchka.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Olga:
That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to. And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him! But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
W-Wait, this isn't...! You're telling me that this is the planted card you "<textEffects>disposed of</textEffects>"? The one you mentioned in this piece of testimony?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I happened to put my hand in my pocket... and found a card.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
Yes, I snuck a peek at it and found it was the Five of Hearts. I had a feeling something might happen so I disposed of the card... before the game.
</line><line>Judge:
Disposed... Where!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
There was an empty bottle of grape juice I had been drinking right beside me. I threw the card inside the bottle.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
The <textEffects>Five of Hearts</textEffects>... This is the card! The bottles were swapped. And the only one who could have done that was the fourth person in the club that night. You, Mr. Kristoph Gavin.
</line><line>Payne:
...
</line><line>Judge:
...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...That is all.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kristoph:
Is... this your idea of revenge, Phoenix Wright?
</line><line>Judge:
Revenge...?
</line><line>Kristoph:
Revenge for the events that took away your attorney's badge seven years ago!
</line><line>Phoenix:
... My past is like my logic, straight and true. Nothing's changed. All I did was point the finger of justice in the proper direction.
</line><line>Kristoph:
... Fine. I'm glad we could have this little tête-à-tête, Wright.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Payne:
This... This is insane! What about me!? Don't I get to prosecute anyone!?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I believe this time we've finally come to the end of our trial. Mr. Payne... do you have a report for us on Kristoph Gavin?
</line><line>Payne:
...He's admitted everything. We're processing his arrest now.
</line><line>Judge:
I see. Still, one has to wonder why he would do such a thing... He didn't even have a connection to the victim... did he?
</line><line>Payne:
Er... None that we know of.
</line><line>Judge:
Mr. Wright, have you anything to add?
</line><line>Phoenix:
... I'm afraid I can't shed any more light on the matter.
</line><line>Judge:
About this victim, Mr. Shadi Smith... His occupation was listed as "traveler"... An odd profession to be sure, and that's all we know about him!
</line><line>Payne:
...I'll arrange a follow-up investigation, Your Honor.
</line><line>Judge:
Good. Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes?
</line><line>Judge:
Seven years... and you still haven't lost your touch.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Kristoph Gavin... ...was a man with much significance for me. Both as a friend... and a lawyer.
</line><line>Judge:
He was extremely talented, to be sure.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I needed two things before I could confront him: The first was a place where no injustice would be tolerated... This courtroom. The second was a man who would tolerate no injustice... In other words, a defense attorney. You, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Me...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
A dark time is coming for our legal system... A twisting of justice brought on by our very own court system. We have to set it right.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Our work lies ahead of us... and I, for one, am looking forward to it.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, this seems like a good time to announce a verdict. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...
</line>

Court is adjourned!

Phoenix:
Thanks, Apollo. You came through, just like I thought you would.
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm pretty sure I didn't do a thing in there! It was you who cornered Mr. Gav... the killer.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I couldn't have done it by myself. You sensed it too, today, didn't you? Your... ability.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Ability?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes... a sensitivity I lack. You'll come to understand it soon enough.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Wait, I wonder if he means...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true?
</line><line>Olga:
O-Of course it's true!
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?)</textEffects>
</line>
<center><b>BRACELET THUMPS</b></center>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
What... What was that, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You'll have to find the answer to that question yourself.
</line><line>Apollo:
The answer... Right... Today was full of questions without answers... Most of them about Mr. Gavin.
</line><line>Phoenix:
What possible reason could he have had to commit murder? Perhaps you'll learn that in the days to come...
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Wait... You don't know, do you?
</line><line>Phoenix:
This locket is the key...
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Oh, that reminds me, I met the girl whose picture is in your locket. Your... daughter, right?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. She's my daughter. You know, you were right about this locket.
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I took this off his neck the night he died. ...But it looks like our dear "Russian" scam artist saw me. So the truth is, this locket really did belong to him.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait! But that's perjury!!! You testified! You said <textEffects>that locket was yours</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I said no such thing, actually.
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I merely said that it was "a locket" with my daughter's picture inside. A subtle distinction, but a distinction none the less. And it's the truth.
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait, but then... why!? Why was the victim wearing a locket with a picture of your daughter inside it!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Sometimes the straightest path to the truth isn't the best one... Give it time. You're still just getting started with your career.
</line><line>Apollo:
...Speaking of which, I may be out of a job. I work for Gavin Law Offices, after all. <textEffects>(I still can't believe I just saw Mr. Gavin get led away in handcuffs...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
... Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes?
</line><line>Phoenix:
How about coming to work for me?
</line><line>Apollo:
Eh!? You mean... at the <textEffects>Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices</textEffects>!? I mean... there's not a single attorney in my generation that doesn't know it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I can't imagine that to be true, but...
</line><line>Apollo:
Wait.. but didn't you... You're not a...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, I turned in my badge, yes. I'm not an attorney anymore.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(That incident seven years ago... That legendary trial... And at the middle of it all was one man... Phoenix Wright! The case reached its sad conclusion.. and he left law for good.)</textEffects> Have you ever thought about coming back to the courts?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm... not qualified to stand in a court of law, I'm afraid. Didn't you notice in today's trial? There was a single piece of <textEffects>forged evidence</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
Forged evidence!? Wh-What are you talking about!?
</line><line>Phoenix:
I'm talking about evidence that shouldn't have existed. A naughty magician's trick...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(Hmm... One piece of evidence struck me as odd, it's true. It just seemed, well, too perfect. I'll bet this was the forged evidence.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
Why? Because the killer took it with him when he left. Leaving the wrong card in its place... luckily for us.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Kristoph:
The court can't accept this evidence! It's a fraud!
</line><line>Phoenix:
A fraud? How can you be so sure? I would think the only person who could claim it was a fraud... ...would be the one who took the real card from the crime scene... The <textEffects>real killer</textEffects>!
</line><line>Kristoph:
...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
My verdict was already handed down... seven years ago.
</line><line>Apollo:
Then... You really...?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yes. I forged this card. One look at the crime scene should've told you it wasn't real.
</line><line>Apollo:
But... But you can't do something like that and call yourself an attorney!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Who's calling themselves an attorney, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
So it's true... The rumor is true! Seven years ago...
</line><line>Phoenix:
... None of that matters much now, does it?
</line><line>Apollo:
...! Nnngh... Grrrraarrrgh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>(I... I punched him...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
... ...It's your story from here on out, Apollo. Perhaps I can help you turn the next page... My office's address. Drop in, if you like.
</line><line>Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh, about your uppercut... Try yelling, "<textEffects>Take that!</textEffects>" next time. I find it packs a little more punch. And Apollo, thanks for today. I had a good time.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Apollo:
And with that, Mr. Wright walked out the door. ...And that's how my first trial ended. A lot of mysteries went unsolved... And, at the time, I had no idea they were all related. Every mystery that day... ...connected by a single thread of logic... I'd find that out soon enough. My name is Apollo Justice, attorney at law. And this is how my story begins...
