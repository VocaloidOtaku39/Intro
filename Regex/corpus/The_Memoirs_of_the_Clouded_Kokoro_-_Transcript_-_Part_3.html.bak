Ryunosuke:
Whew. We made it back in one piece...just. To be perfectly honest, I thought we were finished there for a while.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh, I know. What a lot of close shaves. There are so many carriages on the streets of London, you were very nearly flattened several times.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh...no...I didn't mean that.
</line><line>Susato:
Yes, I know. It was a marvellous defence, Naruhodo-san, it really was. I was in awe of you!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...thank you.
</line><line>Susato:
And now that your fervent exploits have won us some more precious investigation time... ...let's see if we can't find some new clues for court tomorrow!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. Let's do that! .........
</line><line>Susato:
Everything alright?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I suppose...I still can't quite believe it, that's all. That I'm here in England working as a lawyer, I mean. In the Old Bailey, no less.
</line><line>Susato:
.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(The truth is, it shouldn't be me, should it? It should be him standing in my shoes. It should be Kazuma.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
...It was Kazuma-sama's wish that you follow him to Great Britain and work alongside him.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes. I mean, I never had the chance to ask him exactly why, but...he clearly had a plan. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.
</line><line>Susato:
And you're doing wonderfully, Naruhodo-san! I've no doubt that Kazuma-sama would say exactly the same if he were here with us.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Susato-san. Thank you.

Susato:
...What do you suppose is happening? It sounds like some sort of disturbance...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes, I hear angry voices...
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Be not angry, o ample lady! Verily, thou art mistaken.
</line><line>Green:
Mistaken, my foot! You were looking! You were looking at my painting!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
'The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen...' 'Twas foul indeed, the poison that moustached villain gaveth me! Forgive me, lady!
</line><line>Green:
I wish that you'd died from that poison!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
God-a-mercy, ample lady! But thou seest, I have vigour still! Behold, my Shamspeare dance!
</line><line>Susato:
...This looks rather ominous, doesn't it?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Ah... Lo, 'tis the lawyer from the land whence riseth the sun! How now?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um, what are you doing here, Mr Shamspeare?
</line><line>Shamspeare:
Marry, I do believe I am return'd unto another ward!
</line><line>Green:
He was looking, that's what he was doing! Looking at my terrible work!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
......... Eastern fellow, so dark yclad... ...faith, thy work in court this morning was wonderful. I do applaud thee!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, well...thank you.
</line><line>Shamspeare:
But! That doesn't mean things will go so wonderfully for you tomorrow, does it?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...!
</line><line>Shamspeare:
...Anon, exeunt!

<textEffects>(Mr Shamspeare might technically be the victim in this case... ...but there's definitely a lot more to it than that. It's very hard to pin the man down.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Green:
I'm so sorry. I'm such an awful person.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah, Miss Green. Is everything alright?
</line><line>Green:
Oh...yes...I mean, don't worry about me. They're about to discharge me, so...I must get ready to leave now.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see.
</line><line>Susato:
We're delighted that you'll soon be well enough to go home, Miss Green.

Oh dear, you're too kind. I, I don't deserve it.

I'm sure I mentioned it only yesterday, Mr Sholmes.
</line><line>Sholmes:
I'm sure you think you did. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! ...Well, we can laugh about it now! So tell me...how did the trial go?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Reasonably well so far. We've managed to escape without a guilty verdict at least.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Really? I would have liked to see it. And I must pass the time of day with Mr Reaper again. It's been too long.

Ryunosuke:
Oh! Hello again, Inspector Gregson.
</line><line>Gregson:
What are you doin' here?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Erm, well...we were hoping to have another look around, actually.
</line><line>Susato:
The lawyer representing the defendant has a right to examine the scene, as I'm sure you're aware.
</line><line>Gregson:
Yeah, I know the score.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, one other thing... The soap on the ledge outside the window. Did you find it? With the tea in it?
</line><line>Gregson:
Yeah, we found it alright. And there was a small amount of tea in it, as you said.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(I knew it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
It's with the identification section at the Yard now. They're lookin' into it. The results should be available later today.

That's wonderful news! Thank you!

......... Pretty impressive performance in court this mornin'.

Sorry?

Nothin'! Forget it! Just make sure you don't disturb anythin' in here!

<line>Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! What are you up to over there?
</line><line>Sholmes:
What a question, indeed! Was it not your good self who asked me to attend the scene?
</line><line>Gregson:
Oi! What are you doin' there, Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
'What are you up to over there?' 'What are you doing here?'... Dear me, once a great detective, one is always under scrutiny, it seems.
</line><line>Susato:
Is now the time, Mr Sholmes? Are you about to show us your forensic talents in action as you promised?!
</line><line>Sholmes:
With the greatest of pleasure, my dear madam!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um...what's all this?
</line><line>Sholmes:
'All this' is precisely what you requested, Mr Naruhodo. Herlock Sholmes's sensational <textEffects>Skin Print Seeker</textEffects> gun! Moments ago, I took a sample from the teacup that was used by the victim.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
A sample? From Mr Shamspeare's cup?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Each individual leaves microscopic secretions on everything he or she touches. A sample of those secretions is all I need to produce this... a refined indicator solution. By liberally spraying the room with this chemical... ...<textEffects>everything the victim touched</textEffects> is instantly revealed with the aid of these goggles. Here, try them out! There. Now, spray the chemical indicator about and all will be revealed?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Spray? How, how do I do that exactly?
</line><line>Sholmes:
A little press of [A / X / space] on the area you're interested in is all that's required. ...Like this!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! Wh-What is that stuff? It's like fog!
</line><line>Sholmes:
A suspension of the chemical indicator in a pressurised gas. It's the most efficient way to cover a large area. That was another invention I discovered incidentally whilst I was developing this idea.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(As you do...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Go ahead! Try it, my dear fellow! We may learn something interesting about the victim's movements on the night in question.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Well...there's nothing to lose, I suppose... Let's explore!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line><i>After spraying chemical around painting and floor to right of table:</i>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well, we sprayed Mr Sholmes's amazing 'skin print' indicator all over this room, didn't we?
</line><line>Susato:
We did. But there are...<textEffects>two places</textEffects> in particular that are of interest, I would say.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The handprints on the floor there...and on the wall by the picture, you mean?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes! And I think the floor warrants closer investigation! I won't be a moment... ......... Ah!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What is it, Miss Susato?
</line><line>Susato:
Look here, Mr Naruhodo! One of the floorboards has popped out!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
One of the...? You mean... <textEffects>(It's <span style="color:#E16935">a secret hiding place</textEffects>?!)</span>
</line><line>Sholmes:
Excellent work, Miss Susato! So...what do we have in here?
</line><line>Gregson:
Oi! What are you lot doin'?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson!
</line><line>Gregson:
Stand aside right this minute! It's my job to investigate there!
</line><line>Sholmes:
No need, Inspector. You continue to dig in to your portion of chips, whilst we dig around under the floor here.
</line><line>Gregson:
Your fancy talk's puttin' me off my food anyway, Sholmes! A new bit of evidence is exactly what I need.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Wow, a secret hiding place under the floor! What a find!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Susato:
It's not a hiding place you could make use of in Japan. I don't think I could lift a straw tatami mat...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
No, I know. But I never expected one of these wooden floorboards to move, either. It's got me wondering about the wall over there, too. Aren't you curious?
</line><line>Susato:
Oh! I'll investigate at once! ......... There's nothing behind the picture, sadly. Only the wall.
</line><line>Sholmes:
Hmmm... How disappointing.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
But then...how do you explain the handprints?
</line><line>Susato:
...I really can't think why anyone would have been touching the wall over and over in one place like that.
</line>

</line><line>Gregson:
...What is it, Sholmes?
</line><line>Sholmes:
I thought perhaps you might show me what you've found there. Seeing as we're such good friends.
</line><line>Gregson:
...We're not friends.
</line><line>Sholmes:
...No, I...suppose not. A dismal failure!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...I heard. <textEffects>(Ugh, I'd kill to know what was under that floorboard.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Gregson:
......... Alright then, fair's fair.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What?
</line><line>Gregson:
You did discover the hidin' place, after all. I suppose I should at least fill you in.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Really, Inspector? Thank you!
</line><line>Sholmes:
Do it quickly, my dear fellow! If there's one thing I know about this man, it's that he blows with the wind! As fickle as the weather!
</line><line>Gregson:
Oi! Stop makin' me out to be some kind of nut! There were <textEffects>three items</textEffects> under the floor there: a newspaper clippin', a photographic print and a tin box. Now...what do you want to know?

Mr Ross had been writing a letter when he passed away. The landlord found it in his room. It...was a very personal letter...to you.

......... It was at the art school. That's where I met Duncan. A year ago now. He was working to fund his studies. He dreamt of becoming a professional artist one day.

And the two of you became romantically involved?

...Yes, that's right. We were very much in love. We were engaged to be married, actually. That's why he decided to move into a cheaper room. To save money for the wedding.

Something which occurs to me with some regularity, Miss Susato, is this: Why do detectives insist on such an ex post facto modus operandi? Why <textEffects>solve</textEffects> a case after it's happened... ...instead of <textEffects>preventing</textEffects> a case before it happens? That is what sets a great detective apart!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
</line><line>Sholmes:
There is a case waiting to happen under our very noses, Mr Naruhodo. So let us avert disaster! Let us prevent this case from ever happening...with nothing but careful observation.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Alright.
</line><line>Sholmes:
All the clues you need are set before you. You need only look, and you cannot fail to see!
</line><line>Susato:
You can do it, Mr Naruhodo! I know you can!

</line><line>Green:
I think...I really will have to ask you to excuse me now. I've told you everything.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I'm very sorry to have had to drag up such painful memories for you.
</line><line>Green:
No, it's fine.
</line><line>Susato:
Miss Green... ...please, promise us you won't try to...do anything like that again.
</line><line>Green:
Yes, don't worry. Your detective friend has the bottle now anyway. And besides... ...I've been stabbed in the back and had a close shave with a bottle of poison and I'm still here. I think...I'm destined to see things through to the end. It might sound a little conceited, but, well...that's how all this has made me feel.

<center>Leaving Miss Green and St Bartholomew's behind... ...we made our way back to Baker Street with Mr Sholmes.</center>
<line>
Sholmes:
Well, it would appear we've reached the end of the investigative trail for today.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Yes...it's late.
</line><line>Sholmes:
And, Mr Naruhodo...? ...Did you discover anything that may be of use to you in court tomorrow, do you think?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Details about Mr Shamspeare...Mr Garrideb's lodgings... the convict, Selden... There are many facets to this case, and we're <textEffects>yet to see</textEffects> to the heart of it, if you ask me. That's my feeling, anyway.
</line><line>Susato:
I can't help wondering about the results of the analysis.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Into Mr Natsume's tea, you mean?
</line><line>Susato:
Yes. Will they have found strychnine in it or not?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Well, I fear that either way... ...it will be hard to escape the grip of our friend Mr Reaper.
</line><line>Susato:
Oh dear...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<textEffects>(Yes, Barok van Zieks...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Sholmes:
But I wish you every success, of course. And though I was late to rise this morning... ...tomorrow will be a new dawn! I intend to spring from my bed at a crisp hour and attend the trial.
</line><line>Susato:
Mr Sholmes! You're going to come?
</line><line>Sholmes:
Indeed! Whatever happens, I shall be there! ...Assuming my eyelids cooperate in the morning.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Well...I think we've done all we can. All that's left is to remain focused and keep fighting for Mr Natsume's cause until the very end.

<center>London, the world's most prosperous city, home to some six million people. But away from the razzle-dazzle, down back alleys and behind bricked-up windows...the lonely lurk. Soseki-san had battled long and hard with loneliness during his many months here. And so I felt honour-bound to battle equally hard for my compatriot. To lift the curse that gripped him. As Mr Sholmes said, tomorrow would be a new dawn...for all of us!</center>
