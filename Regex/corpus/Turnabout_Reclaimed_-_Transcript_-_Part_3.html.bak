Athena:
*siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*
</line><line>Trucy:
That was a big sigh, Athena.
</line><line>Apollo:
Did you... lose the case?
</line><line>Phoenix:
No, we won. The defendant was found not guilty. 
</line><line>Apollo:
Huh? Then why are you so dejected?
</line><line>Trucy:
Daddy... were you being mean to her?
</line><line>Apollo:
What?! Picking on the new kid? Not cool, Mr. Wright. Not cool...
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait a minute! Talk about false accusations! We were able to prove the defendant's innocence... 
</line><line>Athena:
...But then Sasha got arrested instead. 
</line><line>Trucy:
So that's what happened. That's too bad... 
</line><line>Apollo:
So what are you two going to do now?
</line><line>Phoenix:
...We're going to get to the bottom of this. I don't believe for a second that Sasha did what they're accusing her of. 
</line><line>Athena:
I-I don't believe it, either! I won't give up! Boss, let's go see Sasha and tell her we want to represent her!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right now, I imagine she's still being questioned by the police. Let's get started on the investigation first, and look for proof of her innocence. 
</line><line>Athena:
Sounds like a plan!
</line><line>Trucy:
Just leave the office to me and Polly, Daddy.
</line><line>Apollo:
If there's anything I can do to help, just say the word!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks. If you could organize the evidence and clean the office, that'd be great. 
</line><line>Apollo:
...I meant, anything I could do as a lawyer...
</line><line><textEffects>Unnecessary evidence given to Apollo.</textEffects>     
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That takes care of that. Time to head to the scene of the crime!)</textEffects>

<line>
Athena:
Huh? There's no water in this pool. Orlaaa! Where are youuu?
</line><line>Orla:
</line>
<center>...Fweet...</center>
<line>
Phoenix:
I can hear her at the bottom of the pool. Maybe there's some water down there. 
</line><line>Athena:
Orla sounds so sad. Maybe she misses Sasha.
</line><line>???:
Careful, there! You shouldn't get right up to the edge like that! 
</line><line>Fulbright:
You don't want to end up like the victim! Besides, the police are still conducting their investigation here. Don't go poking around!
</line><line>Athena:
Detective Fulbright...! Grrr!
</line><line>Fulbright:
Is something wrong, Ms. Lawyer? You look angry. 
</line><line>Athena:
I object to you arresting Ms. Buckler!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Detective, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case, if you don't mind.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Go right ahead!

<line>Phoenix:
By the way, Detective Fulbright, do you think Ms. Buckler's questioning is over?
</line><line>Fulbright:
No, not yet. But I told the guy in charge to take it easy on her... 
</line><line>Athena:
Why? Is something wrong?
</line><line>Fulbright:
...Oops! Forget I said anything. It doesn't concern you two anyway. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
But it does concern us. We intend to represent Ms. Buckler. 
</line><line>Fulbright:
What? You do? In that case, I have a favor to ask. Could you get this medicine to her?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Medicine...? Looks like a prescription from Hickfield Clinic... <textEffects>(I've spent some time at that hospital, myself.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
We confiscated it from her home when we were doing a search. I can't get away here, so if you could make sure she gets it, that would be great. 
</line><line>Athena:
Medicine, huh...? Does Ms. Buckler have some illness?
</line><line>Fulbright:
Um... I think that's the kind of question you'd better ask her. In justice we trust! Now I need to get back to the investigation.
</line><line><textEffects>Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
We can give it to her as soon as they let us talk to her. <textEffects>(And we have to return her calendar to her as well. If we can't see Sasha or investigate, we should question people at the aquarium...)</textEffects>

Athena:
Huh? <textEffects>That door</textEffects> is open. It was closed yesterday.
</line><line>Phoenix:   
Well, you know what we have to do, right?
</line><line>Athena:
Of course, Boss! We sneak in and check it out! 
</line><line>???:
Hey, you two! Who barges into a person's lab without permission?!
</line><line>Athena:
Eeek! We're sorry!
</line><line>Phoenix:
My apologies, sir. She insisted... 
</line><line>Athena:
Don't throw me under the bus, Mr. Wright!
</line><line>???:
The polite thing to do is nock and <textEffects>ask if you can come in</textEffects>! Now, start over!   
</line><line>Athena:
Y-Yes, siiir!
</line>
<center>*knock, knock*</center>
<line>
???:
Come in.
</line><line>Athena:
Thank you! Sorry to bother you!
</line><line>???:
Now, what can I do for you? Medical problems?
</line><line>Athena:
Um, well, yes... I'm not feeling super good at the moment... We're not making any progress on this murder investigation, and--
</line><line>???:
...Hey, Miss? Where is the patient? Don't you have your pet with you? ...Oh, wait a minute. That was my last job. This is the aquarium... I was exhausted from all that questioning... I must've fallen asleep.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wh-What's with this guy...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...My apologies. I just woke up, and I was a little groggy. 
</line><line>Crab:
I'm Dr. Herman Crab. I'm Shipshape Aquarium's resident veterinarian. 
</line><line>Athena:
Oh! You're the "<textEffects>Dr. Crab</textEffects>" Mr. Rimes mentioned yesterday!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(And Rimes also mentioned he hadn't seen Dr. Crab around... I wonder where he was?)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Crab:
...Son of a gun. This little thing doesn't let me get any sleep.
</line><line>???:
*peep!* *peep, peep, peep!*
</line><line>Athena:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! What a cute little thing! Who is it?
</line><line>Crab:
A penguin chick, a member of the Little Penguin species. She lives in my hair. 
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, you're so lucky! I wish I had a pet to live in my hair!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Athena, no pets allowed in my office. 
</line><line>Athena:
Aww, you're no fun... 
</line><line>Crab:
If you two don't have any particular business with me, please leave. I have to get ready to make my rounds. ...Back in you go, little one. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Wait! We'd like to ask you a few questions, to save Ms. Buckler!
</line><line>Crab:
Hold on... Don't tell me you're the curious pair who defended Orla?
</line><line>Phoenix:
That's right. Please let us ask you a little about the case.

Huh? Son of a gun. Are you hungry again already? And that silly mother penguin's nowhere to be found again...
</line><line>Sniper:
*peep* *peep, peep, peep!*
</line><line>Crab:
Gaaaaagh! Would you quit peeping in my ear?! According to her walkie-talkie, Rifle is somewhere around the Aqua Tunnel. If you see her, could you bring her to me? I have to go examine some other creatures...
</line><line>Athena:
No sweat! And this time, I'll get her to like me, too!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Rifle has escaped again? What is she, she the Houdini of the penguin world?)</textEffects> There's no guarantee we'll find her right away but let's head for the Aqua Tunnel.

<textEffects>(Uh-oh. We ran into the sea lion before our penguin...)</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
I write the truth. And I will find the truth with my own eyes! I won't be bested by the likes of the blue and yellow duo!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(When did we become the "blue and yellow duo"...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Widget:
<textEffects>Athena will never give up!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
In that case, I'll leave the questioning to you, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks a lot, Widget. Well, at least she's a worthy adversary! Okay! Let's do this!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. You'll do great! <textEffects>(You know, being the boss isn't half bad.)</textEffects>

This recording contains the <textEffects>Swashbuckler Spectacular song</textEffects>. In it, you can see Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together.

<line>Orla:
Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!

We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see...
Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!

<line>DePlume:
! B-But I've never heard this song before!
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? But they always sing this song during the Swashbuckler Spectacular... 
</line><line>DePlume:
Well, I haven't seen the show recently... A year ago, they used the song that I sang to you. I'd recognize it anywhere! Perhaps that killer whale can sing two songs?
</line><line>Phoenix:
According to Ms. Buckler, Orla only knows one song.
</line><line>DePlume:
Then... what was that song that I heard...? 
</line><line>Athena:
We wish we knew... 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(The orca sang a song she isn't supposed to know how to sing...?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>Swashbuckler Video updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>DePlume:
It's obvious I have a lot more investigating to do on Shipshape Aquarium. And perhaps I'd better look into the <textEffects>Center for Dangerous Animal Control</textEffects> as well...

All right, team, let's do our best! I have faith we can save Sasha all together. 
</line><line>Athena:
It sure feels nice to be part of a great group like this! I just want to say that I really love working here, with all of you fabulous people. Thank you for bringing me aboard, Boss!
</line><line>Phoenix:
S-Same here, Athena. <textEffects>(She's so earnest, she's making me blush.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Okay! Let's all run over to the aquarium!

<line>Fulbright:
In justice we trust! Good timing! We're done with the crime scene for now... ...and we're just about to examine the show stage. Marlon Rimes helped with the cleaning, so we've got to go talk with him.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(...I thought he'd be more tight-lipped than this, but hey...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
You're welcome to look around here now, if you'd like!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thank you. I think we'll do just that.
</line><line>Fulbright:
Oh, by the way... If you want to examine the bottom of the pool... ...I recommend using that hoist over by the ladder to get down there.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(That crane-like thing hanging from the ceiling, right? Got it.)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Fulbright:
Just stand on the ladder platform, and the police guard will operate it for you. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Thanks. <textEffects>(Why couldn't the pool be less deep...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Fulbright:
Well, good luck to us both! In justice we trust!
</line><line>Athena:
Now that Detective Fulbright's gone, we can do anything we want here!
</line><line>Phoenix:
The guard is still here, so keep your voice down when you say stuff like that, Athena...

Is this a good time to get started, Mr. Nick?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Started with what?
</line><line>Pearl:
This is the crime scene, right? So this should be the perfect place to start <textEffects>forensicking</textEffects>!
</line><line>Phoenix: 
<textEffects>(She wants to use the forensics kit so badly, she's practically beaming.)</textEffects> Okay, let's do it. Forensicking, it is!
</line><line>Pearl:
Hooray! I get to help! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
All right. We'll need these...
</line><line>Athena:
Um... what's with the glasses, Mr. Wright?
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's not like they're a fashion statement! We need them to see if there's any blood! All right, Pearls. You spray the luminol wherever I need it, okay?
</line><line>Pearl:
Got it, Mr. Nick! I won't miss an inch!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Got your glasses on, everybody...? Good. Now to check out the bottom of the pool.

<line>Phoenix:
I guess that's about it for inside the pool.
</line><line>Athena:
Then let me just get a quick photo to remember the occasion by! It's not every day we get to see the bottom of an aquarium pool! Yeah! That's a good shot!
</line><line>Pearl:
I'll mark where the luminol reactions were. 
</line><line>Athena:
Yay! My first collaborative work with Pearly!

</line><line>Orla:
Fweet............
</line><line>Athena:
Orla...? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!
</line><line>Phoenix:
What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!
</line><line>Pearl:
Oh no! Maybe it's because of that luminol I got on her! Wh-What do we do, Mr. Nick?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
We can't do anything for her ourselves! Let's get Dr. Crab!
</line><line>Athena:
I'll run and get him!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Crab:
What's Orla's condition?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
She's listless and sinking! Maybe she's unconscious?
</line><line>Crab:
The pool is drained. Son of a gun! Who did this?! She'll drown unless we do something. ...Here. Give me a hand.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh? Us?
</line><line>Crab:
No, I meant the Steel Samurai. Of course you! Just help me!
</line><line>Athena:
What...? A-All right! What do you want us to do?
</line><line>Crab:
There's no time to fill the pool to get her up to the top. Get the orca stretcher! It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a <textEffects>pirate flag</textEffects>. When the stretcher is ready, press the <textEffects>hoist button</textEffects>!  
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay! We're on it!

<line>Phoenix:
Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...! Dr. Crab! The stretcher is ready!
</line><line>Crab:
Good! Let's get it under Orla!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Crab:
I'll take it from here. Stand back. I have to treat her immediately... Hmm... There's something in her stomach...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Crab:
There. I got it all out.
</line><line>Athena:
Will Orla be all right, Dr. Crab?!
</line><line>Crab:
Yes, she'll be fine. She's just sleeping now. Orcas are mammals, so they won't die if they're out of the water for a little while. But their own weight puts stress on their organs, and their skin starts to dry out. I put some of my special handmade cream on her skin as an emergency measure.
</line><line>Athena:
Feel better soon, Orla...
</line><line>Pearl:
Oh, if only I hadn't gotten that luminol on her...! 
</line><line>Crab:
Luminol? Nah, no problem there. That stuff just washes right off. Orla's condition has nothing to do with you, young lady.
</line><line>Pearl:
Really? Then what is wrong with Orla?
</line><line>Crab:
I don't need to share that information with you people! It's none of your business. ...I have to get back to my rounds, so I'll leave the rest to the crew. Please keep an eye on Orla while I rouse up some crew members.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Dr. Crab sure is acting funny... He seems to be hiding something... Maybe we should check on Orla's condition before the staff get here.)</textEffects>

<line>Athena:
I guess that wraps up our investigation here. Orla still isn't fully awake yet... Oh, here comes some staff! Looks like they're going to put Orla back into the pool.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
And I guess they're going to fill the pool back up. I bet that will take awhile... Well, I guess we can leave Orla in the staff's capable hands now.
</line><line>Athena:
...Right! So, where to now?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Let's head to the show stage next. If we're lucky, the police will be done with the place.

Prosecutor Blackquill insisted, so I brought him along to get a little exercise.
</line><line>Athena:
Is it business with us...?
</line><line>Blackquill:
...No, not you. My business is with that animal keeper there. Marlon Rimes... You will be a witness for the prosecution tomorrow.
</line><line>Rimes:
Ya gotta be kiddin'! Why would I wanna testify against Sasha?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What you "want" does not matter. ...Now, come along.
</line><line>Rimes:
But if I leave, who's gonna feed the orca? The other animal keepers are too scared to go near her now.
</line><line>Pearl:
Um, maybe I can help? I'm concerned about Orla's health... and this way, I can stay close and look after her. I can feed her and do a telecast, too, if you need me too! I'll do anything to help!

Hee hee. I'll be fine. I'm just happy to help. Oh! But I don't have a TV phone... I won't be able to contact you if I have to do a telecast... Marlon, may I please borrow yours?
</line><line>Rimes:
What? ...Sure, Small Fry. Anythin' for you! Especially when you're goin' out of your way to help like this. I dunno if I'm gonna testify, but I guess I can at least hear what the police have to say.

Thanks for your cooperation! Now, justice will be served... with a strategy meeting!

Grrr! C'mon, Mr. Wright! Let's get back to our investigation!
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Hmph. How sad. The police have already investigated all there is to investigate. Your efforts are a waste of time.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Nothing we do to try and save our client is a waste of time, Prosecutor Blackquill. 
</line><line>Blackquill:
Today, the orca. Tomorrow, Sasha Buckler. You intend to save them both? Hmph. You say you "believe" in your clients, but isn't money really your true motivation? Why not admit you're only doing this for your own benefit? I could understand that much more readily than your empty, righteous talk. 
</line><line>Athena:
Our own benefit?! That's not why we're doing it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Now, Athena. Try not to let him get to you.
</line><line>Fulbright:
All right! We should be off, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust!

Grrr! I've never been so insulted! Be right back! I need some water to wash away the anger.

Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. <textEffects>(Great, now I have crybabies in stereo...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Buckler:
Okay! I'm all right now! Thank you for taking on my case! 
</line><line>Athena:
We're glad to do it!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, now that you're smiling again, we have a few questions to ask you.

<textEffects>(I guess we'd better look into Dr. Crab a little more.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Boss, let's go see Dr. Crab!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I was just thinking the same thing. We have a lot of questions to ask him. 
</line>

<center><textEffects>July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger</textEffects></center>
<line>Phoenix:
Oh, it's Pearls... and Rifle. What are you doing here?
</line><line>Pearl:
Rifle came in here, so I followed her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Oh, that's right. We were supposed to deliver Rifle to him. I completely forgot.)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Pearl:
Oh! Rifle!
</line>
<center>Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! What are you doing? Stop that!</center>
<line>Crab:
You silly mother penguin! What if you injured my spectacular, genius brain?!
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-Dr. Crab...? Are you all right?
</line><line>Crab:
Huh? Oh. It's you people. I see you brought Rifle for me. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Uh... Rifle was really laying into you...
</line><line>Crab:
Well, she hates me because she thinks I took her baby away from her.
</line><line>Sniper:
Peep!
</line><line>Rifle:
*kree!* *kree!* *kree, kree!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Gee, Rifle looks so... happy... Is she actually playing with Sniper...?)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Rifle:
*kree, kree, kree!* *kree, kree!* *kree, kree, kree!*
</line><line>Crab:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop all this cacophony!
</line><line>Athena:
The biological parent and the caregiver parent, locked in a struggle over the child...
</line><line>Crab:
*panting* Do you think you could hold this silly mother penguin down for me?
</line><line>Pearl:
All right! I will try!
</line><line>Rifle:
*kree*... *kree, kree!*
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, what are you doing? <textEffects>(I think Rifle just threw something up.)</textEffects> 
</line><line>Crab:
Oh, I'm getting food for Sniper out of Rifle. Mother penguins stock up food for their babies in their stomachs. They break it down in there so that it's easier for the baby to eat.
</line><line>Athena:
Wow. You sure know a lot about animals. 
</line><line>Crab:
...You're trying to pick a fight with me again, aren't you, young lady? Yes, I know a lot about animals. I am a licensed veterinarian. Hmm... Rifle certainly is in a bad mood, even for her.

<line>Phoenix:
The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM. If that's the case, how could you possibly monitor the animals 24/7?!
</line><line>Crab:
Okay. You got me. I guess that was a pretty weak explanation.
</line>
<center><b>1 LOCK BROKEN</b></center>
<line>Crab:
You're right. I guess I can't monitor the animals 24/7. But if I see anything unusual on the camera feeds, I can spring to action right away. And if I can examine an animal, I can usually tell exactly what is going on with them. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(Wow. He's really confident in his abilities.)</textEffects> But I still say you can't do that 24/7. 
</line><line>Crab:
But I'm here at the aquarium most of the time. And I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Anywhere? I say that's not true, either. <textEffects>I have proof that there's a place you can't go!</textEffects> 
</line>


<line>Phoenix:
The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha. So how can you say you monitor all of the animals?
</line><line>Crab:
Son of a gun. So you knew about the security card, did you?

<line>Crab:
Yes, tighter security was imposed on the orca a year ago as a precaution. Due to Sasha's objections, I wasn't allowed to have a card.
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I guess she was trying to protect Orla from him...)</textEffects> So you're monitoring the animals with a system that's "private, company business." But I have to insist you tell me about this monitoring system. 
</line><line>Crab:
Now YOU'RE trying to pick a fight with me?! Very well. I suppose it's only fitting that the spoils go to the victor. I'll tell you about Shipshape Aquarium's ecological data organization system.

What's that sound? Another penguin...?
</line><line>Crab:
............That's my ringtone. 
</line><line>Athena:
Gee, Dr. Crab sure likes cute things.
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Maybe he wanted it to sound like Sniper?
</line><line>Crab:
Hello? Crab speaking... Son of a gun! You people again?! Stop harassing this aquarium! Orla was found not guilty! Why on earth should she be put down?! Huh? Come there on the 26th and explain? Fine. Just let me write it down in my... Son of a gun! Where did my <textEffects>calendar</textEffects> go?
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(His calendar! Could he be talking about THAT calendar...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
...I realize that. If it comes to that, I'll use that drug to <textEffects>euthanize</textEffects> her.
</line><line>Phoenix:
!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. Wright! He s-said, "euthanize her"!

We'd better ask him more about this. <textEffects>(And I should try presenting that calendar to him, too.)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Please let me ask you one more question, Dr. Crab. 
</line><line>Crab:
What is it, Mr. Lawyer? You look so grave. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
I heard something disturbing from the writer Norma DePlume...
</line>
<hr />
<line>DePlume:
The center demanded that the aquarium <textEffects>put the killer whale down</textEffects> a year ago. 
</line><line>Athena:
P-Put her down?!
</line><line>DePlume:
But the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them! 
</line><line>Phoenix:
What makes you think that?
</line><line>DePlume:
Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Phoenix:
I think Shipshape Aquarium might be keeping some kind of secret... ...and that it has something to do with the recent murder!
</line><line>Crab:
............!
</line>
<center><b>5 PSYCHE-LOCKS</b></center>
<line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(F-Five Psyche-Locks?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Crab:
That writer... She just has to stick her nose in everyone's business. Son of a gun... I should have dealt with it all more carefully... 
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(How am I ever going to remove all those locks?)</textEffects>

</line><line>Fulbright:
Sorry to interrupt, but Prosecutor Blackquill wants Dr. Crab. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
D-Detective Fulbright! 
</line><line>Crab:
You again? You couldn't possibly have any more questions for me! 
</line><line>Fulbright:
Well, you see, we're having a little problem... We were going to call the animal keeper as a witness for the prosecution... ...but he's being very stubborn and refusing to testify. And so we thought we'd ask you to be a witness in tomorrow's trial!
</line><line>Crab:
...Hmph. Did you really, now? Well, I'm not taking sides. I'll tell what I know. No more, no less.
</line><line>Fulbright:
That would be fine! Now, if you would please come along with me!
</line><line>Crab:
Well, it looks like we'll have to continue our talk at the trial tomorrow.
</line><line>Phoenix:
I don't know what secret you and this aquarium are hiding... ...but I'll uncover it if it'll help save Ms. Buckler.
</line><line>Crab:
Give it your best shot, then. I'll see you tomorrow.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, it looks like we'll be going up against Dr. Crab in tomorrow's trial. 
</line><line>Phoenix:
I bet he'll be one tough customer. 
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, we'd better get our evidence organized for tomorrow!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'll have Athena hold on to the evidence I don't think I'll need in court.)</textEffects>

<line>Phoenix:
Hello?
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Mr. Wright! I went to Hickfield Clinic!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
A-Apollo, use your indoor voice.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>S-Sorry about that! Anyway, I found out a lot, so I wanted to tell you right away! It turns out that mysterious capsule is a powerful <span style="color:#E16935">sleeping drug</textEffects>. Apparently, the brand name is "3 Zs."</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Okay, yeah. It says "3 Zs" right on it.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>And they said the Shipshape Aquarium vet recently bought a large quantity from them!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
The vet...! <textEffects>(Dr. Herman Crab...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>"3 Zs" is supposed to be for people. But Dr. Crab told them it would work on other mammals, like orcas and dolphins, too.</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(So Dr. Crab's "euthanization poison"... was actually sleeping pills...? When Orla almost drowned today... was it because she'd been given sleeping pills...?)</textEffects>
</line><line><textEffects>"3 Zs" Sleeping Pill updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>And I found out more than just about that capsule! Dr. Hickfield himself gave me some information. Shipshape Aquarium had someone on their staff named <span style="color:#E16935">Azura Summers</textEffects>, right?</span>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, the one who died a year ago. 
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Well, Azura Summers was getting a certain medication from Hickfield Clinic last year... ...the same <span style="color:#E16935">heart medication</textEffects> as Sasha Buckler!</span> 
</line><line>Phoenix:
Really?! <textEffects>(Azura Summers had the same heart condition as Sasha...?)</textEffects> Nice work, Apollo. Thank you. We'll be coming back to the office soon.
</line><line>Apollo:
<textEffects>Okay. Trucy and I will be here!</textEffects>
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, we'd better get back to the office and get ready for tomorrow. What are you going to do, Pearls?
</line><line>Pearl:
I thought I'd stay overnight here and be with Orla and Rifle. I'll be ready for a telecast during the trial tomorrow! Good luck to both of you! 
</line><line>Athena:
Thanks, Pearly!! That way, when we prove Sasha's innocent she can see Orla right away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(I'd love to see Sasha and Orla back together again, both free and clear! But before that can happen, I have to prove Sasha's innocence!)</textEffects>
