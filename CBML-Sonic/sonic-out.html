               <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog has spent years fighting the forces of Dr.
                  Eggman.</strong>
               <br/><i>Within the Final Egg, Sonic faces off with the Egg Viper, an

               <br/><i>Atop the Final Forretress, Sonic battles the Egg Emperor, a
                  humanoide mecha equipped with a lance and shield.</i>
               
               <strong>But after their last battle...</strong>
               <br/><i>Sonic stares down the Egg Dragoon, a flying robot with laser
                  wings and an imposing gatling gun arm.</i>
               
               <strong>...Dr. Eggman vanished...</strong>
               <br/><i>Against an overcast sky, Sonic fights the Death Egg Robot, a
                  bulbous robot with a single glassy eye-like fixture and numerous tentacle
                  appendages.</i>
