Judge:
I hereby call this court to order for this retrospective of fifteen years of Ace Attorney. Are the defence and prosecution ready to proceed?
</line><line>Phoenix:
Erm... ...I'd be more ready...if I had a clue where I was.
</line><line>Judge:
This is the Supreme Court of Judicature in the Empire of Japan...in the Meiji era.
</line><line>Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?! That's like...a looong time ago, right?
</line><line>Maya:
Ooh, maybe we'll get to meet some of our ancestors!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Maya, seriously, could you be any less surprised?
</line><line>Judge:
It would seem that some sort of time warp has taken place...but no matter. So how about the prosecution? Are you ready to proceed?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Um... Well, the thing is, I'm actually, um... a defence lawyer.
</line><line>Judge:
Be that as it may, circumstances dictate that for today, you shall stand for the prosecution.
</line><line>Susato:
...Circumstances dictate it? I think perhaps he means the powers that be dictate it...
</line><line>Phoenix:
I hope you don't think I'm being rude, Mr Prosecutor, but... ...who exactly are you? You seem...strangely familiar.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Interesting... I was just thinking the same thing. It's hard to explain. It's almost as if I know you as well as I know myself...
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I think the fastest way to resolve this is to have you both introduce yourselves.
</line><line>Phoenix/Ryunosuke:
Of course. I'm Defence Attorney... <textEffects>Phoenix Wright</textEffects> / <textEffects>Ryunosuke Naruhodo</textEffects>!
</line><line>Maya:
Oh...I thought you might share a surname or something.
</line><line>Susato:
But you could be brothers, couldn't you? I mean, you both have that same...spikiness!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I think I might remember if I had a long-lost brother, Miss Susato.
</line><line>Phoenix:
......... I remember. Yeah, being told there was an attorney named Ryunosuke Naruhodo somewhere in my family tree.
</line><line>Maya:
So, you did share a surname once? And gramps over there is...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...One of my ancestors!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</line><line>Susato:
...I think she just called you a grandfather, Mr Naruhodo.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I suddenly feel very old...
</line><line>Maya:
AAAAAAAAAH! Then...then...that must mean... ...you, standing beside him... You must be one of MY ancestors!
</line><line>Susato:
...Pardon?
</line><line>Maya:
You're both dignified and ladylike and...well... basically my ideal ancestor! I'm your great, great, grand-something Maya Fey!
</line><line>Susato:
Ah, well...I'm Judicial Assistant Susato Mikotoba, I'm afraid.
</line><line>Maya:
Huh?
</line><line>Phoenix:
In other words, a total stranger.
</line><line>Maya:
Uuugh...I just can't catch a break. I mean, wow, that is BITTER disappointment...
</line><line>Susato:
...I hope you can forgive me.
</line><line>Maya:
Ooh! I know! I can fix this! You could become an honorary ancestor of the Fey family!
</line><line>Susato:
'Susato Fey'...? Well it, it does have a certain ring to it, I'm sure, but...
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
I think we might have just heard the most illogical request in history.
</line><line>Maya:
Uuugh, but it really does have such an awesome ring to it. Susato Fey...
</line><line>Judge:
This trial will discuss the fifteenth anniversary of Ace Attorney that's being celebrated this year.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Fifteenth anniversary?
</line><line>Phoenix:
You'd better believe it! The very first Ace Attorney was released back in 2001. And to celebrate that fact, we've been doing a whole bunch of stuff this year.
</line><line>Maya:
That's right! Like in January, we put on a huge event. The '15th Anniversary Special Trial'! It was sooo much fun!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It was. It really drove home the impressiveness of our fifteen-year-long history.
</line><line>Susato:

</line><line>Susato:
If I might be permitted...to make a small observation.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Oh! Sure...what is it?
</line><line>Susato:
If driving home the impressiveness of a long history was the intention... ...then you should have been celebrating the more than one hundred years since Mr Naruhodo's birth!
</line><line>Phoenix:
More...more than one hundred years?!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...All this impressiveness just makes me feel impressively old.
</line><line>Judge:
Wonderful, wonderful! The court bows down before your ancient wisdom!
</line><line>Susato:
I think...they've started to worship you.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Let's try not to mention the Meiji era again.
</line><line>Maya:
Don't forget that last year we took to the stage and finally appeared in a TV anime series, too! A new story every week! I mean, that was really ace, right?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:

</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Tee-vee...?
</line><line>Susato:
A-ni-me...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
What on earth are you talking about? Stop half-explaining things!
</line><line>Phoenix:
<textEffects>(A hundred years is a terrifying chasm to bridge...it really is.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ah, and there was another interesting development this year, wasn't there? An orchestral concert. The first in nine years, if I'm not mistaken.
</line><line>Maya:
You're not mistaken! With nine years of pent-up emotion inside, I cried so hard!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426133548" class="image"><img alt="Hold it Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Hold it Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426133548" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Or-kes-tral...?
</line><line>Susato:
Kon-sert...?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ah! A western instrumental group performance! Even we ancestors know about those!
</line><line>Susato:
Beethoven...Mozart...Bahha... Oh, how delightful!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Well, I've never heard of that last one, but sure, you get the idea.
</line><line>Maya:
I think it's Bach. Things can get a bit bent out of shape when you mould Western names into Japanese.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Right? Didn't they used to call Shakespeare 'Sao' or something?
</line><line>Maya:
You could have that cool 'o' on the end of your name, Nicko!
</line><line>Phoenix:
...Like 'o' for 'old man'? No thanks.
</line><line>Judge:
And a matter of days ago, on August 3rd... ...to great anticipation across the Empire of Japan, The Great Ace Attorney 2 went on sale!
</line><line>.........
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...thank you very much, Your Excellency!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah, we really enjoyed that one. What a story!
</line><line>Maya:
It was so moving! I was blown away!
</line><line>Phoenix:
I bet you were. After all... ...there were a LOT of loose ends that needed tying up!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Ugh!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Are, are you okay?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...You just...touched a nerve, that's all.
</line><line>Susato:
Your ancestor went through rather a lot, you see.
</line><line>Judge:
It all started with our great forefathers, after all. We are truly blessed to be in your presence.
</line><line>Phoenix:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Forgive me, Your Honour, but... ...that last statement of yours is riddled with contradictions!
</line><line>Judge:
W-What?! Explain yourself, Mr Wright!
</line><line>Phoenix:
It's been bothering me right since the start of this trial, actually.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The way Mr Naruhodo moves. It's very smooth. A little...too smooth, I think.
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Oh, is it? I, I didn't notice.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Exactly! Just like that!
</line><line>Maya:
You're right, Nick... Like, when you thump the bench, it's really jerky. There's only two frames.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Out of interest, what does your 'objection' look like?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
Objection!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Objection!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...That's not actually humanly possible, surely.
</line><line>Phoenix:
The point is this! The jerkiness on this side of the courtroom... ...proves that we're your predecessors! In other words...WE are the ancestors here!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
...What can I say to that?
</line><line>Susato:
Perhaps you're both predecessors and ancestors of each other. If this is some sort of warping of time, that should be entirely possible, I think!
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I think we've covered everything now. It's time for this court to adjourn.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Um, in that case... ...how are we supposed to get back home? You know, to the twenty-first century?
</line><line>Susato:
Well...you could go and explore Meiji Tokyo and pass the time that way!
</line><line>Phoenix:
Huh?
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
The great imperial capital is full of wonders. I'm sure a hundred years will pass just like that!
</line><line>Phoenix:
......... Hm... ...I think this is a perfect opportunity to use that timeless phrase of mine, don't you?
</line><line>Maya:
Ooh! A joint predecessor-ancestor performance! What a treat!
</line><line>Susato:
Altogether now, then...for the continued success of Ace Attorney! One, two...
</line><line>Phoenix/Maya/Ryunosuke/Susato:

</line><line>Phoenix:
Maya! Put the brakes on!
</line><line>Ryunosuke:
You know what they say: what goes around comes around.
</line><line>Susato:
Goodbye for now, everybody. See you again soon!
