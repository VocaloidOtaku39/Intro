Apollo:
Were you able to sleep last night?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?! ...Oh, sleep! Sure, I slept! <textEffects>(For a grand total of zero hours.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
Guten Morgen, you two. You look like you're ready to put on a real show. But before you do, I have a good luck gift for you. The voiceprint analysis came back, and the results couldn't be more clear. The voice in the mock trial video and the tape recording are one and the same.
</line><line>Apollo:
In other words, the recording's a fabrication.
</line><line><textEffects>Tape Recorder updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Klavier:
The lab is continuing their study of the tape. So far, they've found signs of overdubbing. But it's going to take a bit longer to recover the audio that was erased.

Apollo:
! Wh-Who's there? Wait!
</line><line>Athena:
Did you see who it was?
</line><line>Apollo:
No. I got a quick look, but they got away. I think it might've been Hugh. I bet he was eavesdropping.
</line><line>Athena:
I wonder if he saw our hand.
</line><line>Klavier:
Oh, I'm sure he wasn't the only one just now. I bet Robin and Box Girl were listening in, too. I will make sure they don't make a run for it. That is my final gift to you.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, all that's left now is to reach out to the truth!
</line><line>Apollo:
Time for a mini Chords of Steel workout! I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!!! ...Your turn!
</line><line>Athena:
I'm Athena Cykes and I'm fine!!!

District Court - Courtroom No. 4</textEffects></center><line>
</line><center><b>Day 2</b></center>
<center><b>Court Is Now In Session</b></center>
<center><b>All Rise</b></center>
<line>
Judge:
Court will now reconvene for the trial of Juniper Woods.
</line><line>Athena:
The Cykes Brigade is totally psyched... er, I mean, the defense is ready, Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
The prosecution is ready as well... er, I mean, isn't that right, Prosecutor Blackquill?
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, well, moving right along. Yesterday's adjournment was unexpected, yet necessary. But I'll be running a tight ship here today, so no funny business from anybody, understood?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Your Baldness, Robin Newman and Hugh O'Conner have recanted their confessions. But later, I shall grill them at leisure to find whether I can charge them with perjury.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, this sure complicates matters. Still, one must not overlook the facts. Now, about the school camera photo that was submitted yesterday--
</line><line>Blackquill:
A pity, but that evidence is no longer relevant to this case. The art room clock runs fast. It cannot function as an accurate measure of time. As for the bungling detective who overlooked that, he is paying for his failure as we speak.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Poor Detective Fulbright. I hope he returns to work with all his body parts intact.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... But if that's the case, then what will we--
</line><line>Blackquill:
The accused is the sole person who could have moved the body from art room to stage. And I mean to prove it here this day.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(It's just like Detective Fulbright said. But what else does he have up his sleeve?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
My understanding of this heinous crime is thus. The murder took place near the center of the art room, as evidenced by the bloodstain. Blood was also found on some pottery next to the window over the <textEffects>maintenance area</textEffects>. Which is to say the body was carried over to that very window. From there, it was dropped down to the <textEffects>maintenance area</textEffects> below. And though there was nary a scratch to the body aside from the fatal wound... ...that, too, was per the script. A high jump mat was employed to cushion the fall. Then, a ball cart was used to haul the body over to the stage.
</line><line>Athena:
That's not very clever. I mean, it's the same exact body moving scheme as the script. Anyone could've moved the body that way.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Your propensity to spew forth words before you think is not very clever, either.
</line><line>Athena:
Why you--!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Moreover, the prosecution has a witness, which is most unfortunate for you. Witness! It's time for you to come forth!
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
.........Heh.
</line><line>Judge:
*ahem* Well, then, will the witness please state his name and occupation.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Hugh O'Conner. I'm a senior at Themis Legal Academy, and I'm studying to be a lawyer. Yesterday, I told that lawyer there that I would testify to the truth. So, I intend to cooperate fully in today's trial. Happy now, Ms. Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
Nrgh... <textEffects>(What's he up to now?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
The court appreciates your cooperation, Mr. O'Conner. Now, your testimony, please.
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What O'Conner Saw --</textEffects></center>
<line>O'Conner:
The Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.
That's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.
I was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.
She was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.
But I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
The real truth hurts so much, doesn't it, Ms. Cykes? Or maybe you thought I was going to bring up something else entirely against your client?
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh! <textEffects>(Never a snappy comeback when I need one!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
He's coming straight at us today, using any means possible.
</line><line>Blackquill:
To protect the students who had to climb up high when setting up the stage... ...a mat was brought over to the <textEffects>stage</textEffects> from the <textEffects>storehouse</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Our client is the Student Council President! What's wrong with her taking it upon herself to put the mat away after they'd used it?
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Oh, there is plenty wrong. There is but one mat in the entire school that could cushion a fall from such lofty heights. Ergo, the mat in question was indispensable to moving the body!
</line><line>Athena:
Arrrgh! <textEffects>(It sucks being the last to know everything.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
......I think I get it now. The <textEffects>drag marks</textEffects> we saw behind the stage were made by the mat.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... If the only mat of that thickness was where the body is assumed to have been dropped... ...it would be hard to deny a possible link to this case.
</line><line>Apollo:
We're off to a bad start again. You sure you're okay, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
...It's game on, Hugh. Game on. I'm gonna turn your arrogant perfect-score grin into a teary-eyed frown of failure!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Cross Examination</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- What O'Conner Saw --</textEffects></center>
<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>The Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>That's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>I was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.</textEffects>
</line>


<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>She was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>But I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.</textEffects>
</line>

<line>Apollo:
Mr. Confidence sure goes all out when he tells the "truth."
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I don't think he meant for any of that to be misleading, but it doesn't make it factual.
</line><line>Apollo:
Careful now, Athena. A genius like Hugh could be leading you right into a trap.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I'd be surprised if he wasn't. But all I can do is charge forward with both eyes opened!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
So, you saw the back of the stage from the between the stage and the maintenance area? Well, let's take a look at this photo taken by Ms. Scuttlebutt, shall we? This photo shows the students setting up the stage the day before the mock trial. Do you see the big <textEffects>construction screen</textEffects> to the right of the stage in the background here?
</line><line>Judge:
Why, yes. In fact, there were a bunch of those next to my house until a few days ago, too. It was so noisy behind there, but I couldn't take a peek. Oh, how it piqued my interest!
</line><line>Athena:
Exactly, Your Honor. You cannot see past such screens. That is their purpose. Now, let's see... How exactly is that screen positioned again...? Ah hah! Since it was to the right of the stage, it should be right here. And from this vantage point... ...the witness claims to have seen our client behind the stage backdrop.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my! But the screen would've been completely in the way!
</line><line>Athena:
That's right. Therefore, the witness couldn't have possibly seen our client from this point!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Hrrrgh! ...Youch!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order!!! Mr. O'Conner! Have you been lying to this court?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
The screen... Right... It must have slipped my mind.
</line><line>Athena:
What?! Are you telling me you, Mr. Genius, forgot something as literally big as that?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
There are two kinds of memory lapses: the normal kind you mouth-breathers have... ...and the genius-level lapses of memory that people like me have.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Why don't you just admit that it was a normal, everyday brain fart already?!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Will the witness now please restate what he remembers minus the lapses of memory?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh, that's easy. I was on the other side of the screen. 
In other words, I witnessed Juniper from the <textEffects>stage side</textEffects> of the screen.
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
You are testifying that our client was behind the stage. But need I remind this court, the back of the stage is not visible from the front. To actually see our client behind the stage from the stage side of the screen... ...the witness himself would also have to be in the same area behind the stage! But in that case, our client would have definitely seen Mr. O'Conner!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Hrrrrrrgh! ...Youch!
</line><line>Apollo:
Nice one, Athena! Keep it up!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
All right, Golden Boy, is this not your chance? Telling the <textEffects>truth</textEffects> will be like a weight lifted from your chest.
</line><line>Athena:
The <textEffects>truth</textEffects>? What truth?
</line><line>Blackquill:
The fact that Golden Boy here was where he initially stated. That is to say, he was <textEffects>between the maintenance area and the stage</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
But then the screen would've blocked his view of--
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
On the ground, yes, his view would have been blocked, indeed. But consider how smoke always wants to <textEffects>rise up high</textEffects>.
</line><line>Apollo:
A-Athena, look at the photo again! Do you think...?!
</line><line>Athena:
Something on the other side of the screen... Something high enough to see the stage... No way! This <textEffects>crane</textEffects> right here? But I don't remember seeing a crane there on the day of the mock trial.
</line><line>Apollo:
Me neither, but it's probably safe to assume it was moved before you found the body.
</line><line>O'Conner:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>O'Conner:
That's far enough, Prosecutor Blackquill! Remember, you promised!
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. I recall making no such promise. It was you who came blubbering to me about keeping quiet in exchange for information.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Argh!
</line><line>Athena:
What's this about a promise? Is this about whatever Blackquill is using against him?
</line><line>Apollo:
And what's it got to go with going into the crane?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Golden Boy did not go up in that crane for fun. ...He was <textEffects>working part time</textEffects> as a crane operator within school grounds.
</line><line>Judge:
What? Do you mean to tell me a high school student was operating a crane?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>O'Conner:
The witness... er... I mean, I object to the prosecutor's last statement! There's no proof I ever operated that crane!
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
Actually... there just might be something that proves you did.
</line><line>O'Conner:
What?!
</line><line>Athena:
If this whole part time job thing is true, I doubt it would be limited to a single day. You were probably working at the same site the previous day, too.
</line><line>Apollo:
Is this what you're thinking of, Athena?
</line><line>Athena:
Yep. As the court can see, this photo captured the crane's operator. And if you look carefully, he bears a definite resemblance to Mr. O'Conner.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Are you serious?! This is ridiculous!
</line><line>Blackquill:
How very interesting. Let's ascertain whether this is as ridiculous as the witness maintains.
</line><line>Athena:
The defense agrees with the prosecution. Let's bring the facts to light.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That's all very well and good, but just how do you propose to do that?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(The person in this photo has one really distinguishing feature. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but it's at least worth a try!)</textEffects> <textEffects>We can clearly identify the person in this photo as the witness by examining...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
The figure in this photo is wearing a very unique object around his neck.
</line><line>Judge:
Why, yes. You can see it right there. But then, are you saying you mean to...
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner's neck is almost entirely concealed by his tall collar... ...but that's exactly why I believe this warrants further examination!
</line><line>O'Conner:
No! Not a chance! That would be a blatant violation of my privacy!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. You are a disgrace of a man. Now start unbuttoning that collar before I hack it off!
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah! What's the big deal? Now, let's see your neck!
</line><line>O'Conner:
......... Guess I have no choice.
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........Hmph.
</line><line>Judge:
Hm? ...Oh, my!
</line><line>Athena:
So, where did you buy that neckband, if I might ask?
</line><line>O'Conner:
I didn't buy it. It's handmade, and there's <textEffects>only one like it in the world</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, it sure looks like the neckband in the photo. Should we have the photo analyzed?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. You are one irritating lady. ...Fine. I admit it. I work a part-time construction job. It has nothing to do with our school. Operating heavy equipment's no big deal for a guy who can parallel park one-handed. But I never expected one of my jobs would take me to my own school.
</line><line>Judge:
But when you factor in all of the required tests and apprenticeship period... ...wouldn't you have to be at least <textEffects>twenty</textEffects> to have a license for operating a crane?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Oh, um... about that... You see, I'm a genius, so, you know...
</line><line>Blackquill:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Let us dispense with this inane charade, Golden Boy.
</line><line>O'Conner:

</line><line>O'Conner:
No, Prosecutor Blackquill! Please, don'! <i>[sic]</i>
</line><line>Blackquill:
High school seniors are nineteen at most, thus, they fail to complete the requirements. But that does not apply to you, does it, Mr. O'Conner?
</line><line>Athena:
Why doesn't it apply? He's a senior, so he's around that age, right?
</line><line>O'Conner:
No, don't! Please!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Actually, Golden Boy here is <textEffects>twenty-five</textEffects>. He took a <textEffects>seven-year break from school</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
............Wait. Come again?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Take a gander at the official school enrollment documentation. 'Tis all right there.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Arrrrrrrrrgh! ...Youch!
</line><line>Apollo:
T-T-Twenty-five? You mean he's older than me?!
</line><line>Judge:
A twenty-five-year-old high school student?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. A seven-year break... Seven years... I've just one thing to say. There are two kinds of seven-year breaks. The ordinary kind you mouth-breathers take... ...and the genius kind people like me take.

</line><line>Athena:
But a <textEffects>genius</textEffects> would quickly become a chore for a <textEffects>seven-year-break</textEffects>!
</line><line>Apollo:
I think you have that backwards, Athena...
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. Even geniuses make mistakes. I just happened to make mine only seven years in a row.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Only Hugh could get away with using "only" like that.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Enough of this jibber-jabber. Suffice to say, the witness was up in the crane when he saw the accused dragging the mat. The accused readied all she needed to move the body immediately prior to doing so. That much is clear. I see no need to deliberate the matter any further.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Considering that the body was moved in the same manner as in the script... ...I find Prosecutor Blackquill's claim to be quite persuasive. Does the defense care to dissuade me?
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh! As long as a mat was used to move the body, Junie's going to be under suspicion...!
</line><line>Apollo:
...Athena. I just thought of something. <textEffects>What was Hugh doing in the crane</textEffects> right before the mock trial? He couldn't have been on the job at the time. I mean, he was waiting for the trial to start.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, why was he in the crane? Wait, you don't think...?! Your Honor!
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, Ms. Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
I've got it! I've got an amazing idea that will turn the prosecution's claim on its head! <textEffects>(A little conjecture has never stopped us before!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Interesting...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>Mr. O'Conner, you were using the crane to...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
The body was just like it was in the script, so it must've been moved like in the script, too. 
At least, that's what the prosecution believes. ...How simplistic, even foolish.
</line><line>Blackquill:
.........
</line><line>Apollo:
Those are pretty strong words, Athena. You sure about this?
</line><line>Athena:
The witness is a licensed crane operator, so he could have used it to move the body!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. Well, Golden Boy? Care to chime in? I intend to say no more on the matter, save that this does not bode well for you.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Wait, he's on my side this time? Or is this another trap?)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. Watch this! I can use a bow and arrow one handed.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Wow, that's a crazy level of dexterity.)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
I can even drive a crane with one hand. That's easy. But operating the crane itself is so complex, it requires <textEffects>both hands</textEffects>. Now, I would have the court look at this.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh... Please tell me that's a ketchup stain.
</line><line>O'Conner:
You wish. My hand was injured and required surgery. That's the reason I kept my hand in my pocket all this time.
</line><line>Blackquill:
I have already verified this with the hospital of treatment. Quite a nasty wound, they say.
</line><line>Athena:
S-So, how did you hurt it?
</line><line>O'Conner:
I see no need to discuss that. It has no relevance to this case.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Two hands are required to operate complex machinery such as a crane. Ergo, on the day of the mock trial, the witness was incapable of moving the body by crane!
</line><line>Athena:
N-Now I'm the fool?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
I'd planned on moving the crane the night before the mock trial, but then I got injured. Wanting to keep my part-time job a secret, I had to do it just before the mock trial instead.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Arrrgh! And here I thought this was the big break we've been waiting for!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Now that the defense's sophistry is laid bare, I would have the court recall my claim.
</line><line>Judge:
The body was dropped out of a third-floor window to a mat near the maintenance area. Then, a ball cart was used to move it to the stage. See? I've been paying attention!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Well done, Your Baldness. Now consider this! The accused was sighted dragging that mat. Ergo, it was she who moved the body!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, I think you were on the right track, Athena.
</line><line>Athena:
You do?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, Juniper remains the prime suspect if we assume the body was moved as per her script. So, as the defense, you have to figure out how else the body could've been moved.
</line><line>Athena:
B-But... <textEffects>(Oh, is he telling me to think of another way besides the crane?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Ms. Cykes. If you have a counterargument, this court would love to hear it. And if--
</line><line>Blackquill:
If you do not, it is time for the verdict. Isn't that correct, Your Baldness?
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
No, not yet! All I have to do is show that the body wasn't moved like it was in the script, right?
</line><line>Judge:
Well, that WOULD show that the mat had nothing to do with this case.
</line><line>Blackquill:
There is a sword of great renown that cuts down sophistic lawyers. Its name is Evidence.
</line><line>Athena:
Tsk, you don't scare me! <textEffects>(Force a smile, Athena! You can do it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
What's wrong with your face, Athena? It's a weird mix of terror and creepy grin. Just focus on how the body could've been moved <textEffects>without it being dropped</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(How could anyone lower it without just dropping it? It's not like it could fly... ...Or maybe it could. After all, there IS a way to zip between the art room and the stage! Someone could've easily used <span style="color:#E16935">that thing</textEffects>!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
Hm? ...Oh, yes, of course! Ms. Cykes, the court would like to see what you have for us.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(All I have to do is show the tiniest shred of a possibility.)</textEffects> <textEffects>The mat and ball cart weren't used to move the body! This is what was used!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
The key here is <textEffects>the thing that ties</textEffects> the art room and the stage together.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Might I propose an idea? It might do you well to <textEffects>tie your lips together</textEffects>, lest you further expose your ignorance.
</line><line>Athena:
This isn't exactly the time for black comedy, Prosecutor Blackquill... Anyway! The court will recall the wire on which the school banner was hung. That wire was strung between the art room and the stage... ...which allowed students to run or reel in the school banner from the <textEffects>art room</textEffects>. The body could've easily been lowered down to the stage via this wire!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Spare me your armchair theories. This wasn't some kind of high-wire act. The body surely would have fallen, yet there are no signs of blunt force trauma!
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, you surprise me, Prosecutor Blackquill. You didn't actually think I failed to account for that?
</line><line>Apollo:
I'm sure that's exactly what he thought.
</line><line>Athena:
When we investigated the stage yesterday... ...the bottom part of the school banner had been tied into a pouch-like shape. And pouches are useful for carrying things. What do think <i>[sic]</i> this one could have carried?!
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, go on. Please explain!
</line><line>Athena:
The body was bundled into the pouch-like section of the banner and sent down the wire. The body would've been down on that stage in a flash! And there'd be no need for a mat!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I've heard the phrase "carrying the banner," but the banner doing the carrying?
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. I've no patience for you and your cheap parlor tricks. Your claim is as shaky as a corpse performing that absurd high-wire act.
</line><line>Athena:
If you have an actual objection, then just come out and say it!
</line><line>Blackquill:
I trust you recall the bloodstains left on the art room pottery. If the wire had been used to move the body... ...it would have to be via the <textEffects>window above the quad</textEffects> -- the one with the winch. However, the bloodstained pottery was next to the <textEffects>window above the maintenance area</textEffects>. Ergo, the wire and banner had naught at all to do with this case.
</line><line>Athena:
Oh, um, ha ha. The bloodstained pottery... I remember that.
</line><line>Apollo:
This doesn't look good. We'll be back to the mat theory if you don't do something.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, Ms. Cykes? I hope you have something better this time than a circus act.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(If my wire theory is true, then that blood on the pottery must not have been...)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
Maybe it's not the victim's blood. Did the police check to see from whom the blood on the pottery came from?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Shame on you, Cykes-dono. Have a little more respect for the constabulary. ...Fool Bright.
</line><line>Apollo:
Looks like they didn't check it.
</line><line>Athena:
Ah, don't let it get you down, Prosecutor Blackquill! Everyone makes mistakes.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Spare me your cheek. We will know not either way till the tests are run.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(True, but in the meantime, I'm going to press my claim as far as I can!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Your Baldness. I demand that the blood on the pottery be analyzed this instant!
</line><line>Judge:
Of course. It shouldn't take long to get the results back.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Oh, my. That was quick.
</line><line>Apollo:
We're history if it turns out to be the victim's blood.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Please, please let it be someone else's.)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
............Nngh. It seems the blood was not from the victim.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What?!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Furthermore, a comparison with other parties involved with this case reveals... ...that the blood belongs to one <textEffects>Hugh O'Conner</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Score!)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
.........
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woods:
*cough*... *cough, cough*
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, Junie. Just try to relax.
</line><line>Woods:
H-Hugh's hands... His hands were... dripping with blood...!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Your Honor, as we saw earlier, the witness's left hand had suffered a serious injury. He sustained the wound in a struggle with the victim, and his blood got on the pottery. <textEffects>(Then, Junie saw his bloodstained hands as they passed each other in the first floor hall.)</textEffects> It's the only explanation that covers everything!
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
There is but one way now to turn aside her blade. But do not cast the blame on me. Your grudge is with Cykes-dono, for it is she who forces me to expose your secret.
</line><line>O'Conner:
H-H-Heh. F-Fine, whatever.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Wow, how much dirt does he have on Hugh?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
The court will observe this odd-looking envelope. It was inside this that Myriam Scuttlebutt's script was found.
</line><line>Athena:
Ms. Scuttlebutt's...? But didn't the prosecution already claim that... ...this envelope is the one that contained her script?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Circumstances have changed. You see, Golden Boy had hidden this from us all.
</line><line>Judge:
Let's see here... My word! Talk about the world's most painful paper cut!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Indeed. You can clearly see that if this envelope is not opened correctly... ...a powerful spring-loaded blade will shoot forth, leaving a horrible gash upon the hand. The only one who had been told of the correct way to open it was Constance Courte.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss. You really want to see my script that bad? Well, you better watch out. Read it without my permission and you'll wish you hadn't!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Yikes... Myriam wasn't kidding when she said that!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
The blood on the blade is the witness's. Our genius here tried to sneak a peek at the wrong script and paid for his foolishness!
</line><line>Athena:
Ouuuuuuuch! <textEffects>(This guy's the worst genius I've EVER seen!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Don't worry, Athena. The wound isn't that deep. We've still got the wire theory.
</line><line>Athena:
Y-Yeah... I've got it! Since the blood by the window overlooking the maintenance area isn't the victim's... ...there's no longer any basis for denying the body was moved using the wire and banner. Therefore, the defense once again asserts just that!
</line><line>O'Conner:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419203817" class="image"><img alt="AA5 Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="AA5 Holdit.png" data-image-key="AA5_Holdit.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/0/02/AA5_Holdit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419203817" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>O'Conner:
You call yourself a lawyer? Heh. Don't you see the <textEffects>glaring contradiction</textEffects> in your thinking?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh?
</line><line>Judge:
The court would like to remind the witness that his role is not to point out--
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh. And you... How can you adhere to such outdated beliefs. But whatever. It seems you've forgotten the <textEffects>two statues</textEffects> that were onstage directly below the wire. A body sent sliding down that wire would've crashed into them. Care to explain that away?
</line><line>Judge:
Why, I believe he's right. The statues and the wire are extremely close together.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Ugh... So the body would've collided with the statues? Hmm... What if they did collide? Wait, that's it!)</textEffects> Speaking of those statues, we still don't know how they were broken. But if we assume the body crashed into them... ...that would also explain that loud sound we heard while we were in the waiting room.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, now that you mention it... ...you and Mr. Wright went out to the stage after you heard that sound, correct?
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Interesting... How very interesting. But may I ask just one question? When was it that you heard said sound?
</line><line>Athena:
It was a little after the mock trial had started. Mr. Wright and I were practically bored to tears there in the waiting room, when-- Ah!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Precisely. If that sound you heard did happen while the body was being moved... ...that would place it <textEffects>during the mock trial</textEffects>!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Oof. Which means the body wouldn't have been there before the mock trial started.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
You see, right before the mock trial started... I saw the <textEffects>body</textEffects>.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(He said he saw the body <span style="color:#E16935">before the mock trial</textEffects>. If so... ...then my claim that the body was moved <textEffects>during the mock trial</textEffects> doesn't hold water! Stupid contradiction! It's going to get me and our case killed!)</span>
</line><line>Judge:
The focus was on just three suspects because the body was moved before the mock trial. That has been the major premise thus far. Your assertion, therefore, contradicts the very foundation of this case.
</line><line>Blackquill:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Both sides still lack incontrovertible evidence. So, should we not also treat Golden Boy's testimony with some level of suspicion?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... Good point.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Ack!
</line><line>Athena:
P-Prosecutor Blackquill... is on our side! I bet he's figured out the truth behind this case!
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, great, as long as he's not up to something else.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(If the statues really were broken when the body hit them... ...then Hugh's statement about seeing the body before the mock trial is a big fat lie!)</textEffects> Okay, Mr. O'Conner! Let's get to the bottom of this contradiction about when you saw the body. Look me straight in the eyes and repeat your statement to me!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Argh! L-Like I said before, uh... before the mock trial, the body was, you know...
</line><line>Blackquill:
I shall only say this once, Golden Boy. You had best tell the truth, and do it now. That is, if your head wish to enjoy the continued companionship of your body.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Yikes!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Now, out with it! Did you truly witness the body?!
</line><line>Athena:
Or were you just lying about it?! Well, which is it?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
............I...
</line><line>Blackquill:
You what?
</line><line>Athena:
I...!
</line><line>O'Conner:
I............ I never saw the body.
</line><line>Athena:
!
</line><line>Judge:
Are you sure about that? Lie to this court again and I'll charge you with perjury.
</line><line>O'Conner:
There was no body on that stage! I've been lying about that this whole time! I'm... I'm sorry.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Yes! We've exposed Hugh's big lie for what it is! But why would he lie about this to begin with?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
Order! The base premise that the body was moved before the mock trial has been overturned. I imagine that this has an impact on both the defense and the prosecution's case.
</line><line>Athena:
Well, first I'd like to thank the prosecutor. This brings us one step closer to the truth. Now, at least we know the body was moved using the wire and school banner.
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Indeed. That much I shall concede, Cykes-dono. The body was moved as you stated, and <textEffects>in the midst of the mock trial</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... So both sides are satisfied then?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. If the body was moved before the mock trial, we have our three suspects... ...but if the move took place in the midst of the mock trial, it is an entirely different story.
</line><line>Athena:
Right. All three suspects were in the mock trial. That gives them solid alibis.

...Hmph. How simplistic. Did you forget about <textEffects>the student in charge of the audio</textEffects>? Amidst the mock trial, she was the one soul who could leave and reenter the Lecture Hall.
</line><line>Judge:
Wh-What's this?! Who is this person in charge of the audio?!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Oh, no! How could I forget! It was...!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Hey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?
</line><line>Newman:
Eh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the <textEffects>audio</textEffects>. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Blackquill:
Indeed. The one who could enter the art room amidst the mock trial to move the body... ...was none other than the accused, Juniper Woods, for she was in charge of the audio!
</line><line>Athena:
Eee... Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, yes! I see! That DOES make perfect sense!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(This can't be happening. Instead of exposing Hugh's crime, Junie's in even deeper. No matter how you slice it, we're cooked! And here I thought Prosecutor Blackquill was on our side, at least on this issue.)</textEffects>

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Your Baldness, it is time to put an end to this farce.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... The prosecution has presented a quite convincing case. But the defense has one last chance to voice any remaining objections. Well, Ms. Cykes?
</line><line>Athena:
Apollo! What are we going to do?! I've got nothing left! Nothing! Nada! Niente!
</line><line>Apollo:
I've been trying to think of something, but I'm drawing a big blank, too!

Heh. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha ha! Stop right there! All ears to me! It's time you heard about the rare genius of Hugh O'Conner! Listen and you will hear the secret behind my <textEffects>perfect crime</textEffects>!

P-P-P-P...
</line><line>Apollo:
Perfect...
</line><line>Judge:
Criiiiiime?!
</line><line>Athena:
Wait, this is some serious déjà vu. Didn't we just go through something like this yesterday?
</line><line>Apollo:
Yes, yes we did... This had better not be another one of his enraging traps...
</line><line>O'Conner:
The murder, the moving of the body, the cover up! It all sprung from my brilliant mind! Well, go ahead, arrest me! The real killer is right before you!
</line><line>Judge:
Order, Order, I say! M-M-Mr. O'Conner! You already confessed yesterday, then earlier today recanted your confession!
</line><line>O'Conner:

</line><line>Blackquill:
Enough! The only thing maddening is the <textEffects>ignominy</textEffects> you bare for all to see. For it is impossible for you to have been the perpetrator behind this crime.
</line><line>Athena:
Ah!
</line><line>Blackquill:
There is no perfect crime, only a perfect alibi, for you were at the mock trial. And it is silly that I must remind you of this, but you were a participant the entire time. There shall be no mercy if you persist in hindering this trial with your silly little act!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Hugh doesn't seem the least bit shaken by Blackquill's threat.)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
Listen, Mr. Prosecutor. Calling that a perfect alibi is beyond contempt. Your Honor, I'd like to take this opportunity to offer further testimony. I will now demonstrate the very moment of genius that transcended even perfection!

<line>O'Conner:
You won't believe this, but I used a body double!
That wasn't the real me at the mock trial!
That means I didn't almost lose! My body double almost did!
I slipped out stealthily while my double took care of the trial.
I had the run of the campus. In short, I'm the killer. Juniper's innocent!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Hmm... I have a question I was hoping the defense and prosecution might help answer. Is it just me or does the witness's testimony make no sense at all?
</line><line>Athena:
No, it's not just you, Your Honor. All I got from listening to that was a headache.
</line><line>Apollo:
Yeah, that was just plain weird, especially the whole thing about a body double.
</line><line>Judge:
Well, I'm relieve it's not just me. ...And the prosecution?
</line><line>Blackquill:
Your Baldness, summon an ambulance this instance <i>[sic]</i>. The witness is stark, raving mad.

</line><line>Athena:
Widget's not a weird device and I don't waste him on ridiculous testimonies!
</line><line>Apollo:
Easy there, tiger. Think of it this way. We don't want a verdict to be passed just yet. So how about we give Widget a try?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, this is against my better judgment, but I'd like to conduct a short therapy session.
</line><line>Judge:
Your better judgment? I'm a judge, and it's far beyond mine, yet I find it hard to say no. Prosecutor Blackquill, I trust you have no objections? ...Um, Prosecutor Blackquill?
</line><line>Bailiff:
The prosecutor said, "Rubbish! We will be out on a stroll!" then left with Detective Fulbright.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(How does he get away with stuff like that?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Judge:
...Then I'll interpret that as meaning he has no explicit objections. All right, Ms. Cykes, you may proceed with your therapy session.

I've seen my share of crazy trials, but this one takes the cake!

<line>Athena:
I don't get it. His confession is overflowing with happiness.
</line><line>Apollo:
Maybe he enjoys thinking how us mouth-breathers can't comprehend his genius.
</line><line>Athena:
But this goes way beyond normal happiness. He seems to take an insane level of delight in his confession!
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm, even a normal level of delight would be weird for a confession. Then again, he's not what I'd call normal.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Hugh... Why are you confessing? Who is this really for? I feel like that's the key to his out-of-control emotion!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner, yesterday you said that you didn't really care about Ms. Woods anymore.
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
I already told Juniper, so I might as well yell you. I don't really care about her anymore.
</line><line>Athena:
What? Why?
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
Yeah, well, Juniper reported my secret to Prof. Courte.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(His secret? ...Oh, the bribe.)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
She wanted nothing to do with me because I had disappointed her. That's why I don't care about her anymore. I was never trying to protect her. My confession was always about one thing and one thing only: the truth!
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner, you felt great happiness in the fact that you might help set Ms. Woods free. So much that it overshadowed all of your other emotions.
</line><line>O'Conner:
What are you...
</line><line>Athena:
I can hear it clearly now, Mr. O'Conner -- the discord you've been trying to suppress. People don't normally feel like you do when you confessed.
</line><line>Apollo:
So, Hugh really was trying to protect Juniper?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, I'm sure of it. Hugh's feelings for her are the real deal.
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>90%</b></center>

Athena:
<textEffects>(But that means his confession is...)</textEffects>
</line><line>???:
...Finally figured out the obvious, have we?
</line><line>Judge:
Why, Prosecutor Blackquill, you're back.
</line><line>Blackquill:
The confession was naught but lies, save for the part about being in the mock trial. Can we all agree now that the killer is the one in charge of the audio, i.e. the accused?!
</line><line>Athena:
Gaaah! <textEffects>(Why couldn't you have taken a longer stroll?)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
N-No! You haven't unraveled the genius of my body double trick yet!
</line><line>Apollo:
You can't be serious. Do you really expect us to believe you had a body double?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Yes! Yes I do! But if you think I didn't, then prove it! Heh!
</line><line>Apollo:
Either we quit here and Juniper is found guilty, or we play along with Hugh's delusion.
</line><line>Athena:
Let's go with the least worse choice. But first, let me update his testimony.
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:

<textEffects>Juniper's innocent!</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
A body double...? What a bunch of baloney.
</line><line>Athena:
I know, but I can hear the noise. It means there's a contradictory emotion somewhere.
</line><line>Apollo:
Contradictory emotion? Everything he says is one big contradiction.
</line><line>Athena:
Right, and that's why I can hear his inner voice loud and clear! If we just think about Hugh and his competitive nature... ...we should be able to figure out the root cause of his discord!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Hmm... "I didn't almost lose," you say? Very odd... You exhibited <textEffects>happiness</textEffects> the entire time, except during this statement.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Argh! You don't know when to give up! ...Wait, now that I think about it...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(No, don't! Stop making stuff up!)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
When I left the Lecture Hall... ...it was during <textEffects>Prof. Means's pre-trial speech</textEffects>. That's when I moved the body. I then slipped back in just before the verdict.
</line><line>Athena:
So, you're saying you were there the moment your double was about to lose?
</line><line>O'Conner:
Yes, I was! Naturally, I wasn't happy when I saw that. In any case, I was at the far end of the Lecture Hall behind the screen. I figured no one would see me if I came and went through the doors there.

</line><line>Blackquill:
Cykes-dono. How much longer will you indulge him in this charade? While it's true that none in the audience might see him go through either of those doors... ...the <textEffects>faculty seats on the balconies</textEffects> are a different story, and have a splendid view!
</line><line>O'Conner:
...Heh. I thought you could do better than that. The lawyer's bench is on the right side when facing the front of the hall. I used the door on the <textEffects>right side</textEffects> near the lawyer's bench. That means my movements were only visible to someone in the <textEffects>left balcony seat</textEffects>. But that seat was <textEffects>empty</textEffects> at the time, which is only natural. After all, it belonged to Prof. Courte, and as we all know, she was already dead by then.
</line><line>Athena:
......... <textEffects>(That can't be right. An empty balcony seat on the left side contradicts this piece of evidence!)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I've no idea where this contradiction is going. But I don't have any other moves at this point. Guess I'll just have to follow it and see where this takes me!)</textEffects> You said the left balcony seat was empty. But was it really?
</line><line>O'Conner:
I saw it with my own eyes! It was definitely empty!
</line><line>Athena:
But what about this diagram? According to this, <textEffects>Prof. Means</textEffects> was supposed to be seated in the left balcony seat. But if you left the Lecture Hall during his pre-trial speech... ...he would've been standing there at his seat addressing the students and faculty!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Gah! No, this can't be right!
</line>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><b>80%</b></center>

Blackquill:
Hmph. You do no one any favor by exposing the falsities of his confession.
</line><line>O'Conner:
I've told plenty of lies so far, but this part is true, I tell you! There was <textEffects>nobody</textEffects> in the left balcony seat. You gotta believe me!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Hmm, it doesn't seem like he's lying this time.)</textEffects> Okay, Mr. O'Conner! Let's have you testify again, but this time, don't spare any details!
</line><line>O'Conner:
You got it! I'll repeat it as many times as you like! I mean, my ingenious escape act warrants repeating, considering I'm the real killer!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(All I really care about is whether that seat was empty or not.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>The second floor was deserted!</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>Why won't you believe me?! It's true, I tell you!</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>I went out the back door without anyone noticing.</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>Then, all I had to do... was go through the empty audio control room!</textEffects>
</line>

<line>O'Conner:
<textEffects>It leads into the hallway. So I was perfectly capable of moving the body.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
Whoa, talk about a change in tone! It reads like a totally different testimony! It's like he realized something terrible the moment he opened his mouth.
</line><line>Apollo:
If it's something he realized himself, this unease might also register in how he speaks.
</line><line>Athena:
Right. I'll focus on places where he hesitates or stammers, then!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
I detected powerful <textEffects>sadness</textEffects> and <textEffects>fear</textEffects> right after you said this part. It's as if you'd said something you shouldn't have.
</line><line>O'Conner:
What's wrong with you?! You shouldn't reveal a person's inner feelings for all to see!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner, it's you who is revealing your inner emotions by the way you speak. Plus, I have a good idea about why you're feeling sad.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Argh! You're a horrible person! Can't you just leave me be?!
</line><line>Athena:
You said that you went through the "<textEffects>empty audio control room</textEffects>," but that's not true, is it? There was someone who returned from there once Prof. Means finished his speech. <textEffects>And that someone who was in the audio control room was...</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
I know you realized there was a problem with your statement as you were saying it. That's why you felt so uneasy. If the audio control room really was empty... ...that would mean Ms. Woods was roaming around the campus.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
</line><line>Athena:
Mr. O'Conner, if you really want to protect Ms. Woods, just tell the truth. If you believe in her, revealing the truth is the same as protecting her.
</line><line>O'Conner:
...Juniper's innocent. That's the truth. But in this <textEffects>dark age of the law</textEffects>, the truth can be easily twisted to serve anyone's needs. When the end justifies the means, your only choice is to fight back with lies!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Hugh's heart won't hold out under this battle between truth and lies. Is there something I can do to make him recant his false testimony?)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
Heh heh heh. I fear nothing now that I have lost everything! Go ahead, Prosecutor Blackquill. Cut me down if you wish!

</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. Very well, Golden Boy may live.. for now.
</line><line>Athena:
Enough already, Mr. O'Conner. Ms. Woods would never want you to protect her this way. She values the friendship between the three of you more than anything!
</line><line>O'Conner:

</line><line>O'Conner:
That's where you're wrong. She doesn't feel anything for me now. Heh. But what does it matter anymore? I might as well tell you everything. This is, no doubt, news to you, but I am not and never was a genius.
</line><line>Athena:
Sorry, but I already knew.
</line><line>Apollo:
Me, too.
</line><line>Judge:
And don't forget me! ...Though, in all fairness, it was pretty obvious.
</line><line>Woman:
I thought he was genius at first, but...
</line><line>Man:
The stuff he said was crazy.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Arrrrrgh! No need to rub it in! Just shut up and listen! It all started several days ago. I accidently <i>[sic]</i> learned that my parents have been paying good money for my grades.
</line><line>Judge:
B-But that's...! That's bribery!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(So the bribery wasn't Hugh's idea?)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
All of my <textEffects>perfect scores</textEffects> were the product of cold hard cash, not genius. Even worse, when I confronted my parents about it over the phone... ...Juniper overheard me.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, my... What a terrible misunderstanding.
</line><line>O'Conner:
I've been living a lie! I don't know what else there is to say! I'm no genius. I'm completely worthless... <textEffects>A perfect zero</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Hugh...
</line><line>O'Conner:
Even so, I still wanted to make it up to Juniper for disappointing her like that. That's why I wanted to clear her name by pinning the blame on me! I mean, she probably hates me now, so it'd be a relief for her to see me locked away.
</line><line>Apollo:
If you were trying to help her, then why did you testify against her?
</line><line>O'Conner:
You were the ones who told me to tell the truth yesterday! So, I thought if I did, it would help her.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(He wasn't trying to provoke us?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
It looks like we seriously misunderstood him, in more ways than one.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(At the detention center yesterday, Junie was in tears when she opened up to me. But the truth is, the friendship between the three of them is still rock solid! If there were something that could help me prove that to Hugh...)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
Heh. We even have <textEffects>proof of our friendship</textEffects>.
</line><line>Newman:
Yeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I know! What about that proof of friendship they mentioned?! Hmm... I wonder where or what it is.)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<center>... I didn't buy it. It's handmade, and there's <textEffects>only one like it in the world</textEffects>.</center>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Maybe it's... No, that's definitely it! That band around his neck!)</textEffects> Mr. O'Conner! That band around your neck! That's your <textEffects>proof of friendship</textEffects>, isn't it?
</line><line>O'Conner:
!
</line><line>Judge:
Proof of friendship? Is that anything like a proof of purchase barcode?
</line><line>Athena:
In court, evidence is everything. That's why the three friends created friendship bands. It's the <textEffects>evidence that proves their friendship</textEffects>.
</line><line>Judge:
Ho ho. How very interesting... and chic!
</line><line>Athena:
If they have doubts about their friendship, they can look to the proof they have on hand. That's why Mr. O'Conner's hand always goes to his <textEffects>neck</textEffects> when he is pressured. It proves he still has feeling of friendship towards the other two.
</line><line>O'Conner:
It doesn't matter if I wear it if those two...
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
But they feel the same way, too. I know they wear their friendship bands somewhere. <textEffects>(Junie and Robin must both feel the same as Hugh. I just know it! Everything Hugh has said leads me to believe that. In fact, he may have also just told me that the others wear their proof of friendship...)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
All we have to do is think back to their testimonies. Ready? Ms. Newman holds her <textEffects>arm</textEffects> when pressured. And Ms. Woods holds her <textEffects>wrist</textEffects>. I know Ms. Woods very well. She would never abandon her friendship with you over something like this. And taking the blame for her will only succeed in making her terribly sad!
</line><line>O'Conner:
Argh... Arrrgh... Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</line><line><i>Anime cutscene</i>
O'Conner:
Robin, those bands of friendship that you made just for the three of us. You may have forgotten about them, but not me!
</line><line>Woods:
Hugh!
</line><line>Newman:
Hey Hugh!
</line><line>O'Conner:
And to think... I should have known better than to doubt my best friends.
</line>
<hr />
<line>O'Conner:
</line>
<center>I... I didn't kill anyone. And I didn't have a body double.</center>
<line>I didn't move the body. I didn't even see it. And it may look like I'm speed reading... ..."Zen and the Art of Mastering the Bar Exam," but I haven't read a single word!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm? Well, you could've fooled me! In fact, you did!
</line><line>Athena:
Hugh...
</line><line>O'Conner:
...So, Ms. Cykes, can I place my trust in you?
</line><line>Athena:
I'm going to save Junie. So yes, you can place your trust in me.
</line><line>Judge:
Then, am I to understand that the witness is recanting his confession?
</line><line>O'Conner:
.........Yes.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph, a most roundabout trial. I much prefer the turnabout variety myself. Now we are back to the fact that there was but one suspect who lacked an alibi. Which is, in the end, the truth you've been seeking this entire time.
</line><line>Apollo:
So, we're back to square one? Now I'm exhausted and depressed.
</line><line>Athena:
It probably doesn't matter at this point, but I might as well update the Mood Matrix. <textEffects>(...Huh? Does this mean...?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Further resistance is futile. The time for a verdict is nigh!

Please, wait!
</line><line>Blackquill:
What sort of devilry are you up to now?
</line><line>Athena:
What if our client wasn't the only one without an alibi? The trial would continue, right?
</line><line>Judge:
W-Well, yes, I suppose it would. But after such a thorough investigation, does such a person really exist?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, we've found someone. It may have seemed like a major roundabout... ...but Mr. O'Conner's <textEffects>testimony</textEffects> has cracked the case! <textEffects>(There's no more noise. Hugh is telling the truth now. During the mock trial, the balcony seat opposite him really was <span style="color:#E16935">empty</textEffects>!

<line>Athena:
The balcony seat was empty. That much IS true, isn't it, Mr. O'Conner?
</line><line>O'Conner:
That's right. How many more times do I have to say it?!
</line><line>Athena:
So, basically, Prof. Means wasn't where he was supposed to be during the mock trial!

</line><line>O'Conner:
Wait... Are you accusing Prof. Means? That's insane! I mean, he's the one who gave me the <textEffects>tape recorder</textEffects>! "Take this to the police," he said, "and <textEffects>tell them you found it</textEffects>."
</line><line>Athena:
What? Really? <textEffects>(Wait a second!)</textEffects> Mr. O'Conner! Did you just say that Prof. Means gave that phony recording to you?!
</line><line>Judge:
Phony? The defense will refrain from hurling unsubstantiated allegations.
</line><line>O'Conner:
Well, I said he gave it to me, but what do you mean it's phony?

</line><line><textEffects>Tape Recorder updated in the Court Record.</textEffects>
</line><line>Athena:
The voice shouting, "<textEffects>You're a goner!</textEffects>" as recorded on this tape... ...was dubbed onto it using a line our client said in the mock trial video!
</line><line>Judge:
Why, this... this is an extremely crucial piece of evidence!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Prof. Means gave Hugh the phony tape. If that's really true, then Prof. Means has guilt written all over him!)</textEffects> Your Honor! The defense moves to call Prof. Aristotle Means to the stand!

Hmph. The seat was never empty. 'Twas but an oversight by our dullard of a witness. An inmate who was formally <i>[sic]</i> a surgeon once told me something. He said it's often all too easy to overlooked <i>[sic]</i> critical symptoms!

</line><line>Athena:
Well, we're not going to overlook this <textEffects>oversight</textEffects>! If the speech was pre-recorded, the basis for suspecting our client would be shattered! Let's check with Prof. Means and see whether the empty seat was a witness oversight. A verdict without first looking into that would be inconceivable!
</line><line>Judge:
That's enough, both of you. ...Now, here's my opinion on the matter. While a surgeon overlooking critical symptoms is a problem... ...a witness's oversight, too, must not be overlooked. Thus, as to the matter of whether Prof. Means was or was not in his faculty seat... ...I believe we must ask the professor himself.
</line><line>Athena:
I agree. Prof. Means should be here in the gallery today.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph! Do as you please!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Will you please state your name and occupation for the record?
</line><line>Means:
Certainly. I am Aristotle Means. I teach the lawyer course at Themis Legal Academy. And let me add that while... ...I welcome any opportunity to assist with the trial, I don't care for this undue suspicion.
</line><line>Athena:
Don't worry, Professor, we're just interested in the mock trial video right now. We just need to take another look at that speech you gave. Can we count on your cooperation in this?
</line><line>Means:
Very well, if that's all you're interested in. Please proceed, Ms. Cykes.
</line><line>Apollo:
We need to find some sort of evidence that shows this speech was pre-recorded!

All right, I believe we're ready. Let's roll the video.

<textEffects>(There! I finally found what we needed!)</textEffects> Prof. Means, I have only one question about your speech. <textEffects>Why does that last part we just heard contradict with this?!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
The professor said the pure white Lady Justice would be watching over them. But the Lady Justice in the video isn't even close to being white. It's as gold as gold can be!
</line><line>Means:
.........
</line><line>Judge:
I-I'm not sure I can wrap my jaw around that to test its authenticity...!
</line><line>Athena:
I didn't say it was MADE of gold, Your Honor! Now, it's true that this statue is pure white... ...but it broke before the mock trial began. The one you see here is its replacement.
</line><line>Judge:
Oh, well, that's a shame on every count!
</line><line>Athena:
Ironically, this golden statue sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the white one. Meaning the professor wouldn't have made a mistake in its color if he'd been present!
</line><line>Means:
It seems that I have caused some confusion, but it was merely an oversight on my part.
</line><line>Athena:
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</line><line>Athena:
The statue was in the middle of the room. How could you not know what it looked like?!
</line><line>Means:
Well, I was in a balcony seat. Furthermore, the statue had previously been white.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid this isn't sufficient evidence of the speech being pre-recorded.
</line><line>Blackquill:
We had our answer long ago. The accused was the only one to leave the Lecture Hall.
</line><line>Athena:
No, wait! <textEffects>(There's got to be something that can prove that the speech was pre-recorded!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
According to the mock trial video... ...the speech started here... ...and ended here. It was <textEffects>a little over ten minutes</textEffects>, but I doubt anyone wants to be tortured again.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(It was only a little over ten minutes? It felt like it went on forever.)</textEffects> How'd you figure out how long it was?
</line><line>Apollo:
Easy. There's a timestamp in the top right. All you have to do is... ...subtract the time the speech started from the time it ended.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(The speech goes from 10:00-minute mark to 20:35. Wait a second... I could swear I've seen this same interval of time listed among the evidence... Maybe there's a way for me to use the speech time to show that it was prerecorded.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
I would like the court to take a look at this.
</line><line>Judge:
And this is...?
</line><line>Athena:
The voiceprint analysis that proves the voice on the tape recorder belongs to our client.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, but didn't we just establish that the voice on the tape recorder was a fabrication?
</line><line>Athena:
We did, but what I'd like to focus on is the <textEffects>noise</textEffects> that is also there.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Noise?
</line><line>Athena:
Yes. The defense believes it resulted when the tape's previous recording was erased.
</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. And what do you hope to prove by that?
</line><line>Athena:
The length of the noise is what's important. It's <textEffects>ten minutes and thirty-five seconds</textEffects> in all. And what did the timestamp read at the moment Prof. Means began his speech?
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... That would be <textEffects>exactly 10:00</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
Now, let's fast forward this long-winded exercise in boredom to the end. Okay, stop. The video timestamp now reads <textEffects>20:35</textEffects>. Based on this, we know the time it took for the speech alone.
</line><line>Judge:
Right, subtract ten minutes and you get <textEffects>10:35</textEffects>. Hm? Ten minutes and thirty-five seconds?
</line><line>Athena:
Right, ten minutes and thirty-five seconds -- the same as the noise on the tape recording. I assume you all understand what this means. Prof. Means's pre-recorded speech had been where the noise is now!

<line>Klavier:
The lab is continuing their study of the tape. So far, they've found signs of overdubbing. But it's going to take a bit longer to recover the audio that was erased.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
The police are analyzing the noise as we speak. It won't be long until we know what was originally there. <textEffects>(Now I'm sure of it. The professor was trying to create an alibi with the recording... ...by pinning the crime on Junie. Well, he's not gonna get away with it! Not on my watch!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
...Ms. Cykes. I believe you are well aware of my methodology. Even if Juniper were the perpetrator, I would vigorously defend her as per my word. And to that purpose, I offered to be her lawyer. Alas, look what's happened.
</line><line>Athena:
All I've stated are obvious deductions derived from evidence and testimony.
</line><line>Means:
Truth be told, I had no intention of testifying. I had been keeping quiet for Juniper's sake. But now that you cast this blame upon me, I have no choice but to reveal the <textEffects>truth</textEffects>...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Uh-oh! This doesn't sound good...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
I will now reveal the truth behind why I had to pre-record my speech before the mock trial. I, Prof. Means, always say what I mean and mean what I say by all means!
</line>
<hr />
<center><textEffects>Witness Testimony</textEffects></center>
<center><textEffects>-- Prof. Means's Testimony --</textEffects></center>
<line>Means:
The defendant came to me with what she said was very important, and by necessity, secret.
She asked me to pre-record my speech and come to the audio room during the mock trial.
Juniper confessed to the murder and asked that I get her declared innocent in court.
She also said I'd become an accomplice after losing my alibi due to the pre-recording.
But when I said I would protect Juniper, I meant it because it's the humane thing to do.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
Oh, my! So, you're saying the defendant threatened you?!
</line><line>Apollo:
This has to be a lie... I mean, everything about it lines up too perfectly to be true.
</line><line>Means:
On this most consequential of occasions, let me be completely frank with you. Juniper has truly taken to heart my teaching that states <textEffects>the end justifies the means</textEffects>.
</line><line>Athena:
I don't believe you!
</line><line>Means:
When she asked me to defend her, she said I must also prove her two friends innocent.
</line><line>Judge:
Her two friends? The witnesses?
</line><line>Means:
Correct. Hugh O'Conner and Robin Newman. I was to ensure all three walked free. All three were to achieve their dream. That was the <textEffects>result</textEffects> Juniper was seeking. And she was even willing to threaten me, her own professor, to that end.
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. You, no doubt, had high praise for her ruthless tactics.
</line><line>Means:
Yes, well, that is why I vowed to vigorously defend her despite her threatening me. There was a time when lawyers merely sought the truth if they wished for victory in court... ...but, alas, those days are over. Now, in the defense of justice, order,  and all that is good, the end justifies the means.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(I am so sick of hearing that phrase!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Though it truly grieves me so, I must tell you this. Forsake the truth if it's victory you seek. Steel yourself for this new courtroom reality.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(That does it! He's gonna regret dragging those dismal, depressing ideas in here! Since he's already surrendered to the dark age of the law, it's up to me to fight it!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
Why so silent, Cykes-dono? Something the matter?
</line><line>Athena:
This... This is a court of law. It's no place for longwinded talks about idealistic principles. That's why I'm going to let the evidence do the talking.
</line><line>Means:
...Let's not get carried away, now, Ms. Cykes. It will not do to have you attempting to discredit my doctrine. Do not force me to rectify this situation.
</line><line>Athena:
No, go ahead and rectify it! ...Only if I lose and you win, that is!

Even though he's rotten to the core, he's a total pro. I mean, that all made perfect sense.
</line><line>Athena:
Yeah, but you can't believe a word he says! <textEffects>(He's making this up as he goes along. He'll trip up on his own words yet! Time to see how consistently the professor's testimony matches up with his actual actions.)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Athena:
So let me get this straight. You were trying to help Ms. Woods? Ha! That's nothing more than a bald-faced lie -- no offense, Your Honor!
</line><line>Means:
Such defamation of my character and your hair follicles, Your Honor! It is an outrage!
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm. Ms. Cykes will clarify her statement, but leave my hair follicles out of it this time.
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, of course, Your Honor. Now, please take a look at this. The witness gave this tape to Mr. O'Conner. Then he slyly whispered, "Take this to the police and tell them you found it."
</line><line>Means:
There was no whispering, slyly or otherwise involved. I simply did that out of kindness.

Well, then, I'll just mark you absent. Now, get out of my class this instant!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Get out? Very well, if that is your wish. Who am I to deny my homeroom teacher?

</line><line>Blackquill:
Hmph. Constabulary lapdog to teacher's pet. What a malleable mutt you are, Fool Bright.

Very good, Bobby! You just earned a gold star and a promotion to Head Disciplinarian! All right, class is now in session!

I'm not listening to you anymore, maaaaaan! No way, no how! Now, I have a confession to make! You know those two statues that were onstage?! I didn't make 'em all by myseeeeeelf!
</line><line>Athena:
The statues onstage? <textEffects>(Do I want to know where this is headed?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Newman:
I was able to finish one of them, but the last bell rang before I had time for the other one. So, I asked Prof. Means to make it for me.
</line><line>Athena:
In other words, the professor was there on the stage after the last bell?
</line><line>Newman:
Right. And it would have been way past 7:00 PM before he could've finished.
</line><line>Judge:
Prof. Means was still at school?! This is... Well, this is incredibly important testimony!
</line><line>Newman:
The professor told me, "I'll take care of it." I thought my parents would let me be an artist if I said I'd made both statues myself. *sob* I'm sooo sooo sorry for not telling the truth!

<line>Means:
Now, pay attention! Robin took over half a day to complete one statue.
I, however, finished most of the other statue between 7:00 and 8:30 PM.
The defendant Juniper saw the two statues with her own eyes at 8:30 PM.
Completing a statue so quickly meant I could not leave the stage for a single second!
How could I have possibly had the time to go to the art room and commit murder?!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
You're saying the defendant saw the finished statues?
</line><line>Means:
Precisely. She said so herself at the Detention Center yesterday. Her defense team was there and heard her say so, too. Don't try to deny it now!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woods:
That evening, I went back to my dressing room to get something I'd forgotten there. It was well after the last bell rang... I'd say, maybe <textEffects>around 8:30</textEffects>. That's when I noticed that both stage statues were finished. They were quite large, and they were each covered with a white sheet, but I could tell.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Oh, right. The professor was there when that matter came up.)</textEffects> ...Before I address the professor's charges, I have a question for Robin. How hard would it be to complete a statue like that in one and a half hours?
</line><line>Newman:
It would probably take me at least twice as L-O-N-G. So personally, I think it would be incredibly difficult to finish in that short a time.

The greatest riddle of this case has been how the body was moved from the art room. But if the murder occurred on the stage, that means the body was never moved at all.

Silly girl! When the body was found, there wasn't a drop of blood on the stage floor! Surely there would have been some blood if that's where the murder was committed!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(There wasn't any blood on the stage? Really? But there WAS something at the stage at the time of the murder that's now bloodstained.)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
It's true, there were no bloodstains on the stage floor. But there WAS something on the stage that did have a bloodstain. And that would be this: this school banner. No blood would've gotten on the floor if this were under the victim when she was killed!

</line><line>Athena:
What is it noooooooow?! <textEffects>(My theory makes perfect sense!)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
That was a pathetic attempt. You must put every inch of your body into your attacks. The autopsy states the cause of death was loss of blood. Yet only a trace amount was found upon that banner. Where did the rest go? Blood getting on there when the body was moved by wire makes more sense than not.

Actually, the defense has something to explain that, as well.

Y-You do?!

<textEffects>(If there was only a trace amount of blood on the school banner... ...then there must've been something else the killer used to soak up the blood. All I have to do is figure out what!)</textEffects> <textEffects>This is what soaked up most of the victim's blood!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Judge:
Why, it looks like there's some other piece of fabric on top of the school banner!
</line><line>Athena:
It's the Gavinners banner that had been specially made for the school concert. Since it's on top of the school banner, the blood would have hit it first. It could have easily absorbed most of the blood, like a dishcloth... ...and only a small amount would've soaked through to the school banner below. So, it makes total sense for the school banner to only have a little blood on it!
</line><line>Means:
...Argh! Hrrrgh!
</line><line>Judge:
So, that banner absorbed the blood like a dishcloth! Yes, that would explain it!

The Gavinners banner was like a dishcloth...? Surely it was at least towel quality...

Cykes-dono, you are learning to wield a blade quite well. But how will you respond when I come slashing at you like this? The remnant of a large bloodstain was detected in the art room. But why would there be blood there if the murder occurred on the stage as you claim?

</line><line>Athena:
The bloodstain in the art room was faked. How? I'll tell you how. All that was needed was something that could transport the blood upstairs. And that something was... a piece of evidence we've just finished discussing! <textEffects>The killer used this to bring the victim's blood up to the art room!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Means:
To think you'd stoop so low as to present mere garbage to this court.
</line><line>Athena:
It's only garbage because someone tried to destroy it by tossing it in the incinerator. That someone was most likely the killer seeking to get rid of crucial evidence. The killer used the wire to bring the blood-soaked Gavinners's banner to the art room. Then, the blood was wiped onto the floor to complete the ruse! It makes perfect sense!
</line><line>Means:
Gah... Gwaaah!
</line><line>Judge:
Order! Order! This is quite a development! To think the body was never actually moved!

</line><line>Means:
Hold it right there! The body must have been moved! How else do you explain that loud crash you heard during the mock trial?! If it wasn't caused by the body crashing into the statues, then what was it?
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh... I hadn't thought of that. If that loud crash wasn't the body hitting the statues... ...then what was it indeed? <textEffects>(The knot in the school banner shows that something was carried along the wire in it.

</line>


<line>Means:
Aaaaagh! Th-That statue?!
</line><line>Athena:
Yes, I believe it was this statue that broke the other two, not Prof. Courte's body. The unique statue you see on the right, that's the pure white Lady Justice from earlier. Prof. Courte accidently <i>[sic]</i> broke it while she was polishing it the day before the mock trial. But she used her own unique artistic sense and technique to repair it as you see here. Nobody would have guessed that it was originally Lady Justice.

</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. Perhaps you are on to something. But why, pray tell, would anyone move that scrapheap relic in such a tedious manner?
</line><line>Means:
Excellent question, Simon! Keep them coming!
</line><line>Athena:
You know why. But the fact that you won't acknowledge it, shows how twisted you are. Lady Justice was moved during the mock trial. During that time, Prof. Means was fabricating an alibi with his pre-recorded speech. <textEffects>If we consider the facts, then Lady Justice was moved in order to...</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
Prof. Means used his pre-recorded speech to fake an alibi during the mock trial. He wanted to make it look like he couldn't possibly have moved the body. Moving Lady Justice was his way of pointing us to the body and cementing his alibi.
</line><line>Means:
Gaaah!
</line><line>Judge:
That's quite a persuasive argument. For a while there. I thought you weren't taking the trial seriously. Well done!
</line><line>Means:

</line><line>Means:
Heh heh heh heh! You should never underestimate me, Athena Cykes! Prof. Means always means what he says and says what he means by all means!
</line><line>Athena:
Fine, then. Say it already. I'm waiting...
</line><line>Means:
The murder occurred the night before, but the body wasn't found until late the next day. Countless students passed the stage till they met in the Lecture Hall for the mock trial.
</line><line>Means <i>[on blackboard]</i>:
</line>
<center><textEffects>The body would absolutely be found.</textEffects></center>
<line>
Means:
So, answer me this -- why didn't anyone see the body that entire time?
</line><line>Athena:
...That can be explained by, uh... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
</line><line>Blackquill:
If the victim was murdered on the stage and left there... ...the body would inevitably have been discovered. And, of course, there was nowhere to hide a body upon that stage.
</line><line>Apollo:
This is not good, Athena! Our claim is this close to being beaten to a pulp.
</line><line>Athena:
I know... <textEffects>(But we've come so far...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Gah ha ha ha ha! Consider yourself schooled! I couldn't have possibly killed anyone! The killer is none other than Juniper Woods! It always has been and it always will be!
</line><line>Athena:
Arrrgh... J-J-Just wait a minute...!
</line><line>Means:
Poor Juniper. She must seriously regret having asked you to defend her.
</line><line>Athena:
Ugh!
</line><line>Means:
And to add insult to injury, you nearly had Hugh convicted for murder. Surely, you haven't forgotten that little fiasco?!
</line><line>Athena:
Aaaaaagh!

</line>
<center><textEffects>Athena Cykes's attorney's badge is just for show!</textEffects></center>

Not only did you fail to defend your client, you also raised false charges against her friend. You have no right to call yourself a lawyer!
</line><line>Athena:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
</line><line>Athena:
Well, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!

Prof. Courte wasn't killed in the art room. She was killed right where her body was found. We know because there wasn't any time to move the body there from somewhere else. That means the body had to have been hidden somewhere onstage until it was found. Let's think along these lines and see where it takes us. First up... When did Prof. Means remove the body from its hiding place? Well, let's see. What was he doing right before the body was discovered? He was using the span of time his fake alibi created... ...to move the body to where it would be more easily spotted. <textEffects>Therefore, the only time Prof. Means could've removed the body from its hiding place is...</textEffects>

<textEffects>It was during the mock trial, specifically...</textEffects>

<center><b>The body was moved during the speech</b></center>
<line>
Athena:
Prof. Means moved the body to an easily seen location during his long, pre-recorded speech. <textEffects>The professor also moved something to the stage that wasn't there before, specifically...</textEffects>
</line>



<center><b>The white Lady Justice was also moved</b></center>
<line>
Athena:
During the mock trial, Prof. Means wrapped the white Lady Justice in the school banner... ...and sent it zipping down to the stage with a crash, killing two birds with one stone! He drew attention to the body and made it look like the murder occurred in the art room! But was there anywhere to hide a body on that stage? It doesn't seem likely... ...No, there had to be someplace! .........! Wait a second! How about something that should've been finished but was only mostly done? Something was used to cover the body up... ...but it didn't draw undue attention because it looked like it belonged there onstage. In that way, no one would suspect there was a body hidden inside! <textEffects>What was already on the stage and capable of concealing a body?</textEffects>
</line>



<center><b>THE BODY WAS HIDDEN BY WRIGHT'S STATUE</b></center>
<line>
Athena:
Oh, I know! The Mr. Wright statue was never actually finished! The body was wrapped under some cloth to hide what was really inside... ...cleverly disguising it as the boss's statue!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Ms. Newman gave up on the Wright statue, yet Prof. Means finished it in a single night.
</line><line>Judge:
Yes, what an impressive feat that was!
</line><line>Athena:

</line><line>Athena:
No, his so-called work of art deserves none of our praise. That's because it was only a façade to hide his real work -- the murder of Prof. Courte!
</line><line>Judge:
Come again? I'm afraid I don't follow.
</line><line>Athena:
He hid the body by making it look like the statue of Mr. Wright. With the body wrapped under a piece of cloth, it looked just like a statue!

</line><line>Athena:
We'll never know until we try!
</line><line>Apollo:
Uh-oh... I think I know where this is going.
</line><line>Athena:
Okay, Apollo! Time to turn me into a <textEffects>reasonable likeness of Mr. Wright</textEffects>! I'm going to pose like the statue, like so... And now I want you to wrap me up in a cloth so that I look like a statue!
</line><line>Apollo:
Um... I hate to ask the obvious, but where am I supposed to get this magical cloth?
</line>
<hr />
<line>Judge:
I'm afraid that isn't the right color, Mr. Justice...
</line><line>Apollo:
Well, given how sudden the request was, it's kinda the best I could do, Your Honor... All right, I think that about does it!
</line><line>Athena:
Well, what do you think, everyone?! Do I look just like a statue of Mr. Wright or what?!
</line><line>Man:
</line>
<center>-- Looks like some random person to me.-- Weren't the statues a pair of busts?</center>
<line>
Woman:
</line>
<center>-- Phoenix Wright has that spiky hair on the back of his head.</center>
<line>
Athena:
Forget the hair. The statue's head is way bigger than your average person's anyway! <textEffects>(You gotta hand it to me for trying, anyway. ...Wait, that's it! The hands!)</textEffects>
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
Umm... Her arms are raised over her head and there are <textEffects>dark bruises</textEffects> around her wrists.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Yeah. The professor was probably tied up with something.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(The marks on her wristed <i>[sic]</i> indicated she'd been tied up!)</textEffects> Apollo, tie me up in a new pose! ...Wait, you're not into this kind of thing, are you?
</line><line>Apollo:
What? No! Besides, it was your idea! ...Just tell me how to tie your hands, already!
</line><line>Athena:
Prof. Courte's wrists were tied together, and I can't help but think that's related! <textEffects>(How should I arrange myself to match the shape I want, given her hands were tied?)</textEffects>
</line>



<line>Athena:
Apollo, tie both of my hands behind my head!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
See! This makes it possible to fake the spikes on the back of Mr. Wright's head!
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure, but then what about <textEffects>the statue's arm</textEffects>? With both arms behind your head, you can't exactly complete the pose...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Yeah, it would be awfully hard to make the objection pose like this...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Apollo:
Hmm... I can't help thinking you've forgotten something, Athena. Something on the body that you don't have right now...
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(What did the victim's body have that I don't?)</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
Oh, right! There was an arrow sticking out of her side! Okay, Apollo, take that and plunge it into my side!
</line><line>Apollo:
Wh-What are you crazy?!
</line><line>Athena:
Fine, then go get some duct tape! Rapido, schnell!
</line><line>Apollo:
All right, all right! I don't need to know other languages to know "bossy" when I hear it.
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
The fatal arrow to the side! Spiky hair created from two hands! A masterpiece in the making! Now, cover me with that cloth! But remember to make the arrow stand out, okay?!
</line>
<hr />
<line>Woman:
</line>
<center>-- Mommy, the arm's too short!-- Shhh. Remember your indoor voice, dear.</center>
<line>
Apollo:
Nobody's buying it! The arrow's nowhere near long enough!
</line><line>Athena:
B-B-But! <textEffects>(What else could you use for the arm?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Means:
Still won't give up, eh? I must commend you, if only for your spirit and determination.
</line><line>Judge:
Of course she's not giving up! After all she's put me through, she owes me an explanation -- and one that makes sense! Now, disappoint me again and the penalty will be doubly painful!
</line><line>Athena:
Yikes! I guess I'd better get it right this time! <textEffects>(Think, Athena, think! Prof. Courte was murdered when she stopped by the stage to see Prof. Means. If it wasn't premeditated, he must've used something close at hand in his little ruse.)</textEffects> ...Apollo. Show me those stage set up photos again.
</line><line>Apollo:
Like that? Right now??? O-Okay, hold on!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Please, please, please... Please be in this photo! It just has to be!)</textEffects> <textEffects>The arm on the Mr. Wright statue is really this right here!</textEffects>
</line>


<line>Athena:
Got it! I know what he used for the arm on the statue of Mr. Wright!
</line><line>Means:
This is absurd! There is no such thing in this photo!
</line><line>Athena:
Heh heh heh. Don't play dumb with me, Professor. It's the staff you have right there!
</line><line>Means:
S-Staff?! This is the spear of a great legal warrior!
</line><line>Athena:
Whatever, just hurry up and lend it to me! The length is perfect! Mr. Wright couldn't possibly object to such an awesome arm! Okay, go for it, Apollo!
</line><line>Apollo:
Sure, I'll give your arm a hand! Cloth and binding coming right up!
</line>

Golden light? All I see before me......... is the <textEffects>pink</textEffects> specter of a man!

Blah, that joke deserves a <textEffects>pink</textEffects> slip.

We had assumed the victim's jagged wound came from the arrow being forcibly shoved in. But if the wound was from this spear instead... ...then we should be able to detect traces of the victim's blood on it!

<line>Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, what has become of our witness, Aristotle Means?
</line><line>Blackquill:
It is as Cykes-dono suspected. Blood was detected on his staff. He has admitted to this heinous crime. All of it. He shall join us in the clink tomorrow. His teaching skills can be put to good use there.
</line><line>Apollo:
Great. He'll teach felons that the end justifies the means. So much for rehabilitation.
</line><line>Athena:
Can I ask what the professor's motive was?
</line><line>Blackquill:
...Hmph. I could barely make out a word he said on account of his shattered teeth.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(One of Blackquill's fellow inmates was once a surgeon. Why not a former dentist, too?)</textEffects>
</line><line>Blackquill:
I eventually had him put pen to paper. It turns out, Prof. Means was the one taking bribes. The victim has suspected him after a report from the class snitch. That led her to question him at length the day of the killing -- right there on that stage. The result? The heinous crime that was brought before this court. The fool, like Newman, had come to know of the script's contents via the victim's note. It seems he came up with a plan to stab the victim with her own awl in order to... ...make the killing look like the one in the script and thus frame the defendant.
</line><line>Athena:
But that scrap of paper with Hugh's name had the same mark as Prof. Courte's planner--
</line><line>Blackquill:
Yes, about that... Those planners are bestowed upon all students graduating at the top of their class.
</line><line>Athena:
Really?! So, then...
</line><line>Blackquill:
Indeed. Once upon a time, Prof. Means was also awarded the same notebook. The handwriting is being analyzed now, but like as not, the scrap belonged to him. This too, was evidence of the bribery scheme that the victim had obtained. Know that Constance Courte was clean and that only Aristotle Means took the bribes.
</line><line>Judge:
Hmm... To think a professor would murder a colleague, then try to pin it on a student. If this is the dark age of the law, then we can only hope that a brighter future awaits. And the first step is to hand down my verdict for a promising young lady. This court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods...
</line><line>Woods:
.........
</line>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<line>Judge:
I wish you all the best on your road to becoming a courtroom judge. We will need young people like you... ...if we ever hope to restore the law to its former glory.
</line><line>Woods:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! I'll work as hard as I can. Maybe, one day, I'll be able to work with all of you to make a difference!
</line><line>Blackquill:
Proudly serve Prof. Courte's memory. Do not let her death be in vain.
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(That's the last thing I expect to hear from him today...)</textEffects>

Thank you, Thena! I really mean it!
</line><line>Athena:
Ha ha ha ha ha! It was nothing, really! I can take the biggest tangled mess of a case and unravel it just like that!
</line><line>Apollo:
I dunno... You looked pretty wound up there at the end -- literally and figuratively!
</line><line>Athena:
You look pretty hungry for a knuckle sandwich, buster!
</line><line>Woods:
I... I wanted to thank you, too, Apollo.
</line><line>Apollo:
Ah ha ha. Don't mention it.
</line><line>Woods:
The way you were always there for Thena when she was in a bind... And at the Detention Center, when your smile gave me hope when there was none... It was like the warm rays of the sun shining down on peaceful woodlands. I think you're an absolutely amazing person!
</line><line>Apollo:
Thanks, Juniper. That means a lot to me. But I still have lots of work to do! And I can't wait until we see you on the judge's bench!
</line><line>Woods:
Ha ha ha ha! I promise you I'll get there someday! That's why until that day, I'll... I'll--
</line><line>Trucy:
Guys, I've got some big news! I mean, this is huge! ...Oh, am I interrupting something?
</line><line>Athena:
N-No no, it's okay... I think. So, what's the big news?
</line><line>Trucy:
The school festival! It was supposed to have been canceled after what happened, but...
</line><line>Phoenix:
...We just got a call. In memory of Prof. Constance Courte, who worked so hard to make it happen... ...the festival is being extended one extra day until tomorrow.

Aaaaaah! Your singing voice, Juniper! It could melt my H-E-A-R-T!
</line><line>O'Conner:
...Mr. Wright. Thank you for that training seminar.
</line><line>Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. Just remember, the "Objection!" pose is all about attitude. Oh, and congrats on your mock trial win. Although, Robin had you for a while there.
</line><line>Newman:
I did, didn't I! But I'm just glad we're back to how we used to be, thanks to Athena. And you know what? I think I'll stick with become a prosecutor after all. I'm going to make up for my mock trial loss by winning the real deals in court!
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Mock trial loss? What loss? Wait. Did they reprise the trial and Hugh won?!)</textEffects>

<hr />
<line>Athena:
<textEffects>(So... does this mean it's really gonna happen?)</textEffects>
</line><line>O'Conner:
.........J-J-Juniper! There's something I've been wanting to say to you!
</line><line>Woods:
Huh...?
</line><line>Trucy:
Oooooh! Is he going to do what I think he is?!
</line><line>O'Conner:
J-Juniper... Can we still be friends? You know, best friends like we've always been?
</line><line>Athena:
Huh? Best friends...? Hugh, weren't you going to profess your love for Juniper if you won the mock trial?
</line><line>O'Conner:
No, I was going to confess... ...that I'm not a genius, and that I'm really twenty-five years old. But you already dragged it out of me during the trial.
</line><line>Athena:
Whoops!
</line><line>Woods:
Listen, Hugh. You, too, Robin, Myriam.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
M-Me, too?
</line><line>Athena:
<textEffects>(Myriam's got this tactical espionage action stuff down to a science...)</textEffects>
</line><line>Woods:
...I've been thinking. It's up to us to put an end to the dark age of the law if we can. Let's all work together to usher in a new age where winning only results from the truth... ...and the end never justifies the means.
</line><line>Newman:
Count me in!
</line><line>O'Conner:
I wouldn't have it any other way.
</line><line>Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!
</line><line>Apollo:
Best friends forever, huh... No matter what anyone says, nothing beats true friendship.
</line><line>Athena:
You bet! And what about your BFF, Apollo?
</line><line>Apollo:
Aren't you a bit old to be using that word? But yeah, he's the best friend a guy could have. Which reminds me, we're supposed to meet up and gossip about the new girl in the office.
</line><line>Athena:
Hey! No talking about me behind my back! ...So, what kind of guy is he, anyway?
</line><line>Apollo:
Well... If I had to describe him in one word...
</line>
<hr />
<line>Athena:
And so, after some slight arm-twisting, Apollo promised to bring me to meet his friend. Unfortunately, that promise was never meant to be fulfilled. For not long after, their <textEffects>friendship</textEffects> was mercilessly severed by Fate... ...and the bonds between us began to fray and unravel as well.
</line>
<center>"Sorry, but I'll be taking a leave of absence."</center>
<line>
Athena:
Even now, those words continue to ring in my ears. The <textEffects>discord</textEffects> in our ever-cheerful Apollo's voice made him sound so cold... and distant. Why, Apollo? Why? Why would you leave us all behind?
